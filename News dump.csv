politics,howard  truanted to play snooker  conservative leader michael howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.  mr howard said his time at jack s snooker hall in llanelli in the 1950s had not done him  any lasting damage . but he told the times educational supplement that truancy was  very bad  and said  firm action  was needed. mr howard also called for a return to o-levels and more classroom discipline.  mr howard eventually left llanelli grammar school - and the snooker hall - to go to cambridge university. he said:  i don t think it s done me any lasting damage. nor has it made me a snooker world champion.  there might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.   i m just being honest. i think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it.  another player who has failed to win snooker s world championship - jimmy  the whirlwind   white - has previously admitted missing lessons  instead spending his days in smoky halls.  tony meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there   mr white said   we loved the game and the atmosphere.  school went out of the window. i went for a while and then started taking time off.  mr howard s fellow welshman ray reardon - known by his fellow professionals as  dracula  - won the snooker world championship six times  having left school at 14 to work as a miner. and terry griffiths  like mr howard from llanelli  won the tournament in 1979. it is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at jack s.
sport,wales silent on grand slam talk rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite a third six nations win.   that s the last thing on our minds at the moment   said williams  a second- half replacement in saturday s 24-18 win over france in paris.  we all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to scotland and beat them.  we ve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we ll worry about ireland hopefully after we ve beaten scotland.  with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb  williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.  kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full-back  leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth. a hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start  but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on 13 march. hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in paris  but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection. said wales assistant coach scott johnson:  they ve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive.  so we re getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad.  scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over italy.  matt williams  side has shown little in attack  but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down.  italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it s very hard to win   he said.  so an ugly win can be just as effective as a 30 or 40 point victory.  scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we re not taking anything for granted.  we re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games. we ve got to be diligent in our preparation.  that s my job and we ve got to make sure we re focused.
politics,blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.  the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier  conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith s statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a  fair summary  of lord goldsmith s opinion.   that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue  saying it had been dealt with  literally scores of times and the position has not changed . lord goldsmith has denied being  leaned on  and says the words written were his.  the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence  told the bbc on friday:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said.  mr mates added:  we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers  advice to the government has been published.  and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  this is argument was rejected by mr blair  who said:  firstly  we haven t broken the precedent  and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it.  in a book published this week  philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers  says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands  book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code.   my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee  summon the attorney  get all the papers out  look at exactly what happened   she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday  lord goldsmith said his statement had not been  written by or at number 10 .  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions   he said.
sport,ireland 21-19 argentina an injury-time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday.  o gara kicked all of ireland s points  with two dropped goals and five penalties  to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu  and felipe contepomi kicked 14 points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain  ireland continued to come second best in tight situations  and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. o gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute  but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. o gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute  but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front  while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous  if fortuitous  comeback.

and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro. women s top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez.  henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year  so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne. the seventh seed  who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year s first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight  is looking forward to the match.  he s tough player on any surface  he s got a lot of ability   he said.  we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i m going to need to play well from the outset because he s a dangerous competitor.  switzerland s federer  seeded one  is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters  but is taking nothing for granted.  it s a tricky match   federer said.  i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then. but you never know  if the rhythm is a bit off  he can keep you guessing and make it difficult.  the most important thing  though  is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.  the 23-year-old could meet four-time champion andre agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting russian marat safin  the player he beat in last year s final.  eighth-seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in

politics,uk will stand firm on eu rebate  britain s £3bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week s european council summit  jack straw said.  the foreign secretary told mps the rebate  secured by margaret thatcher in 1984  was  entirely justified . new european commission president jose manuel barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the eu budget. mr straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation eu still had to  see the light  on the rebate.  but the foreign secretary told the commons foreign affairs committee:  our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation.  he added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the uk s stance - britain contributed more and received less than other eu states. the two-day european council summit in brussels begins on 16 december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the eu s budget for 2007-13. the wrangling could stretch into 2005  even 2006.  the uk  france  germany  austria  the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states  combined national incomes - the commission wants it to be 1.26%. mr straw said the eu commission s proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.  i don t know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount   he added. the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.

sport,philippoussis doubt over open bid mark philippoussis is almost certain to miss the australian open after suffering a groin injury during the hopman cup loss to the netherlands.  the 28-year-old suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles. he is now unlikely to be fit in time for the australian open which begins on 17 january in melbourne.  he has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis   said hopman cup doctor hamish osborne.  it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once  let alone two days in a row  inside two weeks.   the injury is more common in australian rules football  and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although mark s injury is slightly different.  the australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event.  it s something i ll have to go by feel. i ll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more   he said.  what doesn t kill you makes you stronger. i know i can come back from this and that s all that matters.  - former world number two tommy haas is also a doubt for the australian open after picking up a thigh injury playing for germany in the hopman cup. the 26-year-old had treatment on his left thigh while leading argentine guillermo coria 7-5 2-2. he played one more game  but his movement was hampered and he quit.
sport,corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.  after losses to wales and france  critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full-back. but corry has backed robinson  who was given the role after the injury to fly-half jonny wilkinson  ahead of this weekend s trip to ireland.  jason is doing a tremendous job. every week my respect for him goes up   corry told bbc radio five live.  he is an inspirational captain. when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense.  the players have a lot of respect for him. it s an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him.   england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign. but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest.  there is apprehension going into every game   he added.  but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset.  when the whistle goes on sunday  what has happened in the past does not count for anything.   we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around.  there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something. we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.   a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time  especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since 1948. but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard.  they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game   he said.  the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide.  if you look at the team on paper  they have stars from one to 15. it s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us.  lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.
sport,yachvili savours france comeback france scrum-half dimitri yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat england 18-17 in the six nations clash at twickenham.  yachvili kicked all of france s points as they staged a second-half revival.  we didn t play last week against scotland and we didn t play in the first half against england   he said.  but we re very proud to beat england at twickenham. we were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure. we did well.  yachvili admitted erratic kicking from england s charlie hodgson and olly barkley  who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them  had been decisive.  i know what it s like with kicking. when you miss some it s very hard mentally  but it went well for us   he said. france captain fabien pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against england at twickenham since 1997. france were 17-6 down at half-time  but pelous said:  no-one was down at half-time  we were still confident.  we said we only had 11 points against us  which was not much.  the plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure england to losing their composure.  france coach bernard laporte accepted his side had not played well.  we know we have to play better to defend the title   he said.  i m not happy we didn t score a try but we re happy because we won.
sport,prop jones ready for hard graft adam jones says the wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful france pack in paris.  the prop said:  if we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it.  the mentality of the french is  scrum  scrum  scrum . we will see how good france are and the scrum is the key.  i just hope [the backs] carry on where they left off against italy. it s just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity.  wales have won two of their last three visits to stade de france  having secured back-to-back wins under graham henry in 1999 and 2001. and with the likes of shane williams and gavin henson finding top form at the right time  mike ruddock s team is now one of international rugby s most potent attacking threats.  gavin is ridiculously talented. he has been bouncing around the place this week  so he is up for it   warned jones.  france have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one-dimensional play in their victories over scotland and france. captain fabien pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair  but stressed the game with be won or lost up front. the lock believes the welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line-out  but jones insisted his fellow front-row colleagues have nothing to fear.   gethin [jenkins] won t be intimidated tomorrow  none of us will   said jones  who will be facing france for the first time.  we will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs.  me and gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of mefin s experience in there.  mefin is a good thinker who puts things across. but what is the saying  if you are good enough you are old enough and gethin certainly is.  he is a really good player and i imagine he will be on the lions tour [to new zealand this summer].
sport,mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday.  mcleish told bbc radio five live:  we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it  we absolutely blew it.  there s no use burying your head in the sand  we know we are going to get a lot of criticism.  we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back.  mcleish admitted his team s defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2-0 to guy roux s french side.   i m very disappointed because we didn t give ourselves a chance  losing the first goal from our own corner. it was amateur   he added.  the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half.  it s difficult to take positives from the game. we ve let the fans down.
sport,premier league planning cole date the premier league is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations chelsea made an illegal approach for ashley cole.  both chelsea and arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a premier league commission  but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.  it s hard to put a date on it   a premier league spokesman confirmed to bbc sport.  it s not a formal situation where they ve got so much time to respond.  arsenal and england defender cole reportedly met blues boss jose mourinho and chief executive peter kenyon in a london hotel 11 days ago. chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting  which would be in breach of premier league rule k3.  now the gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been  tapped up . both clubs have pledged to co-operate with the inquiry which will be conducted on a single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation. cole is in negotiations with the gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007. and his arsenal team-mate robert pires has urged the england left-back to stay at highbury. pires told the evening standard:  he has been at arsenal for ever. he is a very attacking left-back and i think he is enjoying his football because at arsenal he plays in an offensive team.  i am not sure he will get the same pleasure at chelsea  even though they are doing so well at the moment.  i have built a fantastic playing relationship with ashley.  we play together so well - we could do it with our eyes shut.  but you have to respect the decision of the player. everybody has that right.
sport,mourinho defiant on chelsea form chelsea boss jose mourinho has insisted that sir alex ferguson and arsene wenger would swap places with him.  mourinho s side were knocked out of the fa cup by newcastle last sunday before seeing barcelona secure a 2-1 champions league first-leg lead in the nou camp. but he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals arsenal and manchester united could exploit.  they cannot speak to us about blips because they re not in a better position than us   mourinho said.  do they want to change positions with us  we are top of the league by nine points and in the carling cup final.  the only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the fa cup.  in the champions league all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still chelsea.   mourinho said it was important to keep his team s results in perspective.  don t try to put pressure on me because i am never under pressure   he warned.  we have lost one important game this week - at newcastle - and we re out of the fa cup but i don t think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat. we are just 2-1 down at half-time.  asked if his chelsea honeymoon was now over  mourinho replied:  i have had 20 years of honeymoons with my wife.  the day that this club is not happy with me is the day that i go.
politics,mps quiz aides over royal income senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the queen and prince of wales are to be questioned by mps.  aides from the duchy of lancaster and duchy of cornwall will appear before the commons public accounts committee. it has been reported they could be questioned about prince charles  spending on camilla parker bowles. but bbc correspondent peter hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. duchy officials  who will appear before the committee on monday  are only responsible for generating money. the duchy of lancaster provides the queen s private income  while the duchy of cornwall provides prince charles  annual income. the duchy of cornwall is a 140 000-acre estate across 25 counties  and also includes residential properties  shops  offices  stocks and shares. it was set up in 1337 by king edward iii to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. it covers the cost of the prince s public and private life - neither charles  nor william and harry  receive taxpayers  money from the civil list. however  the prince of wales did receive over £4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. the duchy last year generated almost £12m. the prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.
sport,federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.  top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic  who beat tim henman in the last eight  dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool  though  turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam  where federer triumphed  but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets.  i really wanted to get off to a good start this time  and i did  and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm   federer said.   that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back  and that was a good effort on his side.  ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set.  i didn t start badly  but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger  if you relax for a second it just goes very quick   he said.  after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know  it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year  and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.  but despite his defeat  the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance.  i had a chance in the third  and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.  it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.
sport,calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country s rbs six nations campaign.  four members of the executive board  including the chairman  david mackay  have resigned after a simmering row. and calder said:  this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby.  david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level  it was him.  mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee  which contains members elected by scotland s club sides.  he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can t be run by amateurs   said calder.   in fact  i don t understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived.  but i don t believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down.  i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and  ultimately  it is them who pull the strings.  so i wouldn t be surprised if they reviewed their position. but  in the wider picture  what message does this send out   he thought the work of scotland s coaches  who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side  would be made much more difficult.  matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering   what have we walked into here    said calder.  and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship.  i am very  very disappointed  more than you can imagine. why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough
politics,tory backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a  tough meeting  where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move  party sources told the bbc. the bill  which ministers claim will tackle crime  terrorism and illegal immigration  is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.  they have said the scheme is  deeply flawed  and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been  agnostic  on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence  the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards  the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said.  it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.   lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.  the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.  the new chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.
sport,benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group.  jorge andrade s early own goal gave liverpool a 1-0 win. and benitez said:  we started at a very high tempo and had many chances. it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals.  we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. we are pleased but move on to the next game.  igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso  and benitez said:  he played very well.  it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level.  benitez added:  it is all back in our own hands now  it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen.  as far as my feelings about winning in spain  that is really not important.  i want to see us win away matches in the champions league  that it was in spain was not my first consideration.  as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win  it is not important in what country it is in.  benitez added: benitez said:  we had a problem before the start  it was decided that xabi could not play more than 45 minutes.  but in the end because of the way that (dietmar) hamann and (igor) biscan performed  we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match.  depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed.  but we knew that if we hit them on the counter-attack it would make them nervous  and that is how it worked out.  deportivo coach javier irureta said:  liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down.  i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring  but that does not reflect our overall performances.  but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination.  the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence. players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it.  i know we are bottom of the group  but as long as there is hope of qualifying  we will hang on to that.

politics,stalemate in pension strike talks talks aimed at averting national strikes over pension reforms have ended without agreement after 90 minutes.  five public sector unions met deputy prime minister john prescott at the labour spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4 million workers could take part in strikes earmarked for 23 march. discussions will resume next week.  a spokesman for unison  britain s biggest union  said after saturday s meeting:  at least we are still talking.  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. the five unions which met mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april.  privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.
politics,tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  party leader michael howard said the new role would replace  inconspicuous  police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing  while labour criticised  extravagant  tory promises on policing.  responding to the plans  the chairman of the police federation of england and wales  which represents rank and file officers  said it was essential operational independence was retained.  jan berry said:  it is a service  not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches.  these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground   she warned. outlining his crime manifesto  mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.  the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  the trouble is  and it s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.  mr howard said the authorities were not  providing the local accountability that we want to see  and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.  critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris  who sits on the executive of association of police authorities  said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.  that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions   he said.  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and  could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials . mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a  minimum policing guarantee  with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard s record  saying police numbers had fallen by 1 132 when he was home secretary. he said:  today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them  other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.  the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.
sport,aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry.  the 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2 060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty.  i am not guilty  nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport   he said.  i m not a racist and i ve never lacked sporting decorum. i ve never done that and i have medals for sporting merit.  aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october.  the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones  but was then requested to do so by spain s anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22 000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger  who was fined £15 000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating  believes that aragones  punishment was too lenient.  you compare his fine and my fine  and if you consider his was for racist abuse  then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should   wenger said.  he shouldn t have said what he said  and how much money is enough  i don t know but it doesn t look a big punishment.  however  aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair.  i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete)   said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions.  i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat.  spain s anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal  and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores  president of the spanish fa s disciplinary committee  said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had  acted in a racist way.   a fine  the highest we could apply  is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated   flores told sports daily marca.

sport,balco case trial date pushed back the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative (balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.  us judge susan illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing - which was due to take place on wednesday - until 6 june. no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september. balco founder victor conte along with james valente  coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.  anderson s clients include barry bonds  and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. the hearing in june will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on balco s offices and anderson s home. conte and anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. balco has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil.  former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain s former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003. and american sprinter marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.

politics,howard pitches for uk ethnic vote michael howard is to make a pitch for britain s ethnic vote urging people who feel  taken for granted  by tony blair to vote conservative.  he will say conservatives  share the same values  as the uk s minorities. and that he wants to build a  better britain  where everyone  whatever the colour of their skin or religion  can  make the most of their talents . but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is  outdated and unjust .   it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities   he will argue. mr howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk.  people from ethnic communities  for example  still earn less than their white counterparts   he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was  free enterprise  free trade  free speech . the tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that hindus and sikhs as well as muslims got  caught in the downdraft of islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11 .  mr howard will make his speech during a visit to support tory parliamentary hopefuls robert light and sayeeda warsi -  the first british muslim woman  selected to run for mp as a conservative candidate. he will attack labour s record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by mps. mr howard will also attack the lib dems for wanting to abolish faith schools  introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven  and  give contraceptives out in schools from the age of 11 .  so i say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel mr blair and the liberal democrats take their votes for granted - come join us   he will say. lib dem president simon hughes branded mr howard  arrogant and wrong  for claiming the tories were the  natural party  for britain s ethnic minorities.  given the tories  considerably reduced support in urban areas  where many black and asian britons live  during their time in power  the evidence simply does not support his claims that the conservatives are the party for these communities   he said.
politics,clarke to press on with id cards new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to  pause for thought  from charles kennedy.  the lib dem leader said david blunkett s resignation was a  good opportunity  to question whether the legislation was necessary. but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now.  id cards are a means to creating a more secure society   he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been  significantly influenced  by the recommendations of the commons  home affairs committee.  the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy  whose party opposes the id cards plan as  deeply flawed  said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors.  wouldn t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary  a new broom  to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place   he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government s plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.  they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.   the home office says people will pay £85 for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card. the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill  mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards  although not to carry them. the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £1 000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £2 500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.

sport,iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich s champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday.  the german club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury. iran refuses to recognise israel s right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition.  he s got back pain and he couldn t train   the spokesman said.  it would have made no sense for him to go.  iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili a $125 000 reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics. the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.
politics,boris opposes mayor apology ken livingstone should  stick to his guns  and not apologise for his  nazi  comment to a jewish reporter  tory mp boris johnson has insisted.  mr johnson also claimed tony blair s intervention in the row was  an attempt to reassure jewish voters . london mayor mr livingstone says he is  standing by  his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a  concentration camp guard . but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry.  labour s mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist  and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked. later the prime minister said:  a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time  but in the circumstances  and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist  yes  he should apologise.   however  mr johnson  who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley  said mr blair  should butt out of  the row.  i don t see why the prime minister has to get involved in this   the spectator editor told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  it s a dispute between ken livingstone and a reporter on the evening standard.  mr johnson  mp for henley-on-thames  oxfordshire  said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters  because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war .   ken doesn t think he s got anything to say sorry for and if that s really his feeling  then i think that he should stick to his guns   he said. mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an  outdated stereotype  of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley. the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. mr johnson told today:  it s perfectly true that i got into the grovelling game myself and when i apologised there were some things that i felt i ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things i didn t think i should apologise for   he said.  but here s old ken - he s been crass  he s been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but i don t think actually if you read what he said  although it was extraordinary and rude  i don t think he was actually anti-semitic.
sport,britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope  paula radcliffe  dropped out of the marathon and then the 10 000m. britain s men s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style  falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later  the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb  it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games.  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell  jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and  just like holmes  finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis  who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis  who was troubled by injury  has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley  who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze.  and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey  who came fourth in athens.  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly  the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  kenteris  the 200m champion in 2000  and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games  adrian annus (hammer)  robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  the fallout from the thg scandal  which rocked the sport in 2003  continued to impact in olympic year. britain s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers  who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg.  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 000m.  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon  there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.
sport,campbell to be lions consultant former government communications chief alastair campbell will act as a media consultant to sir clive woodward s 2005 lions on their tour to new zealand.  campbell  who left downing street earlier this year  will advise on media strategy before and during the tour.  i hope i can contribute to the planning and preparation  and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself   he said.  i am also looking forward to going out for the later stages of the tour.  woodward s decision to call in prime minister tony blair s former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in 2001  when new zealander graham henry was the head coach. the furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of matt dawson and austin healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media.  the lions is a massive media event   said woodward  who will be the head coach.  there will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media  the fans that will go out in their thousands and the new zealand public.  we need to have the strategy and processes in place to deal with the pressures that will bring.  [alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself. his role is to work closely with not only myself but (tour manager) bill beaumont  (media manager) louisa cheetham and (team manager) louise ramsay.  campbell is due to resume working for the government in the new year in the build-up to an anticipated may general election. the lions leave for new zealand on 24 may  with the first test match against the all blacks in christchurch on 25 june.
politics,could rivalry overshadow election  tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.  along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues  they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain. it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. ian gibson  for example  urged the two men to stop squabbling  declaring:  for goodness sake  sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can.  those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.  meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.  but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. and it matters little whether the rift is real or  as some try to suggest  simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. few in westminster actually believe that  simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.  for example  the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories  they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.  mr blair talked about the  new  labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor  who has long rejected the label. and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. that claim was repeated in robert peston s book  a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act.  for his part  mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected.  the trouble is  both men have fallen short of offering simple  straightforward denials of the central claims. so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. they started with and are sustained by  friends  of the two men. one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions. but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides.  there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. it is no secret in westminster  for example  that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.  then there are the actions of the men themselves. gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter  which they believe is a media-only obsession  or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. either way  there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage. there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. but with probably only four months to the next election  that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.
politics,straw attacked on china arms moves to lift the european union s ban on arms exports to china have been condemned by human rights groups and the conservatives.  the 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of china s crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square in 1989. uk foreign secretary jack straw  who will hold talks in beijing on thursday  said an eu arms code was more effective than the current ban. but human rights watch says the eu is putting commerce above abuse concerns.  in december  the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. germany and france have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious but mr straw last week said he also wanted it to end  despite us objections.  he expects it to be lifted over the next six months  a prediction which has alarmed critics. brad adams  from human rights watch  said:  this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.  there are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for.   mr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma. the scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it  he told bbc radio 4 s world at one. in the uk  more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo  he said. and only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code.  the code of conduct is much more effective  it s a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with china   he said.  mr straw denied the decision would suggest to china that tiananmen square had been forgotten. the level of human rights was a key criteria under the eu arms exports code  he said. human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but mr straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many eu countries. conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the move would be  profoundly wrong . the decision could undermine nato as it severely damaged relations with the us  which is opposed to ending the ban.  mr ancram argued:  what the british government is doing is giving in to french and german pressure  especially the french  who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted...  it gives the wrong signals to china  who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at tiananmen square was wrong.  mr straw s china trip is part of regular high-level meetings with beijing ministers. he will meet chinese counterpart minister li zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries  hong kong and china s part in the talks on north korea.
sport,ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer s motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united.  the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid.  a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart   said ferdinand.  no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.  the central defender added on bbc radio five live:  we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with.  i would like to see the situation resolved either way.  i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals.  the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch.   glazer  currently owns a 28.1% stake in the club  and united s statement to the stock exchange said:  the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject.  the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer.  a further announcement will be made in due course.  glazer s previous bids for the club  which united supporters opposed  were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus  who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake  while fans remain opposed to his involvement.
politics,best person  for top legal job the  best person for the job  should be appointed lord chancellor  and not necessarily a lawyer or mp  the courts minister has told mps.  under reforms  the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions.  the lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor   said courts minister christopher leslie. the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday. mr leslie said:  the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons.  under the reforms  the law lords will also be replaced as the uk s highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.  in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. the peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session  but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed. mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor. he said:  what matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties.  it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.   shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an  exceptional institution   providing a  champion of the independence of the judiciary . the government had initially proposed to take this institution and  smash it to pieces   mr grieve said. convention should be  nurtured and celebrated   but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords  the government would have  great difficulty  in getting the bill through parliament. former cabinet minister douglas hogg  whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor  said the bill was  largely unnecessary  bureaucratic and expensive . but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor s role and office  cannot be frozen in aspic .
sport,wales win in rome wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas  tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain  shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england  the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short  the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones  who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england  slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass  and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson  sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england  beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera  who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors  scrum  the home side s forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute  henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal  but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams  the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post  jones adding the conversion. italy  who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time  built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams  who beat several players with ease  and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow  a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead  wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work  shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years  they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  w pozzebon  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni  s dellape  m bortolami (capt)  a persico  mauro bergamasco  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  d dal maso  p griffen  m barbini  kp robertson.  g thomas (capt); h luscombe  t shanklin  g henson  s williams; s jones  d peel; g jenkins  m davies  a jones; b cockbain  r sidoli; j thomas  m williams  m owen.  r mcbryde  j yapp  i gough  r sowden-taylor  g cooper  c sweeney  k morgan.  andrew cole (australia).
politics,ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk s veritas party.  damian hockney  now veritas deputy leader  and peter hulme-cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives  not as individuals. mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter.  she said:  the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you.  we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done  to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election.  mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems.  the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list  their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.  he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate. he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe  rather than sticking to an independent stance. but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman  who said:  mr hockney s accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty.  veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.
politics,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.  five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.  the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.
sport,gallas sees two-horse race chelsea s william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months.   it ll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything   he told bbc sport.  you need to be good and you need a lot of luck. you need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys.   we know that we have got the power in our hands just now   added gallas.   but you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title.  obviously  nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football.  we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first.  gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer.  and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt.  it s only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is a fantastic manager like mourinho   he said.  he is the icing on the cake at the club. he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything.  another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player  even though the fans may consider them to be a stars  within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal.  mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn t have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day.  it is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year.
politics,brown to outline presidency goals next year will be  make or break  for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies.  the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.  he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health  of illiteracy  of poverty  particularly in africa but right through the developing countries.   his proposals were effectively a new  marshall plan  for the world  including an international finance facility  which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed  he argued. the european union s common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems  he said  but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.  mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with 30 000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed  including 100% debt relief multilaterally.  that is why next year is a test   he said.  if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them  then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.  the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown s speech on wednesday.  cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam s paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. the charity s director  barbara stocking  said:  2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough  but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.  the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.  but 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair  who has described africa as a  scar  on the world s conscience  has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing  guff  about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor  he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million africans by 2005. instead  only 500 000 people would benefit  he said.  there s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has   added mr duncan.
politics,ministers deny care sums  wrong  ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.  a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.  the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the  care development group  of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings  according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute.  dubious  assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022  the report warned.  it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland:  we don t think we got our sums wrong.  obviously we will examine the findings of this new report  along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned.  we will look in great detail at any contribution to this  because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future.  and we are absolutely committed to doing that.   but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy  there were questions which needed to be answered and  if necessary  sums redone. she said:  serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive.  we need to know that the money is there  not just for this year or next year  but into the future so that older people  and those who are looking forward to older age  can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.
sport,o sullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie o sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in rome.   it was a hell of a tough game   said o sullivan.  we struggled in the first half because we hadn t the football.  italy played really well. they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it  if that s not an oxymoron.  we said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won  and that s how it turned out.  ireland struggled to cope with italy s fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian o driscoll  who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer.  we had our first attack in the italian half after 22 minutes   said o sullivan.  we had a good return  with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice.  the second half was about spending more time in their half.  scrum-half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih a victory.  all credit to them   he told bbc sport.  we knew it would be tough coming to rome. they always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit.  they had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22.
sport,can smith work scottish wonders  the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager.  from the moment berti vogts  miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended  the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football  the 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006 looks near impossible  having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of 77th  below the likes of estonia  ghana  angola and thailand. scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level  so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. smith s track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. the man who was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven league titles with rangers. and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games  top names  including ferguson and graeme souness  who took him to ibrox as his assistant in 1986. characters like souness  ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game.  much was made of vogts  inability to express himself to the players and media. that will certainly not be the case with smith. the former dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager. smith will inherit the same problems vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of vogts  preparation work. a fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. but will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...
sport,wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against bayern munich was  our worst peformance in the champions league .  kolo toure s late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg  but wenger said:  the only positive is that we are still in the tie.  the players are really down in the dressing-room. i feel we really turned in a bad performance.  at 3-0 we faced a real struggle  but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.   goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals  and wenger said:  we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.  wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself  adding:  but there is enough time for crying. i could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on.  in this job  you have good and bad nights. this was a bad night - but i still have confidence in the quality of my players  as well as their spirit and desire.  but wenger s bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either. he said:  i am far from happy despite the win. my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.   arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.  arsenal keeper jens lehmann  whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result  said:  do i blame myself for the third goal  as a goalkeeper  i always blame myself.  i just know the goals were very easy against us. in my time here  we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens.  it would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. everything is now possible.
politics,debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
sport,faultless federer has no equal roger federer - nice bloke  fantastic tennis player - the ultimate sportsman.  when lleyton hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing  a third in as many months  the australian said;  you re the best.  how right he is. the stats speak for themselves: 11 titles from 11 finals during 2004 - three of them grand slams - and 13 final victories in a row going back to vienna 2003. that s an open-era record. hewitt  at times in houston  showed form which easily matched his grand slam-winning efforts of 2001 and 2002. but he was outplayed. twice. hewitt  along with andy roddick and marat safin  is sure to be prominent during 2005. but realistically  all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. according to all those players and even federer himself  the swiss star is in a different league.   right now i feel that a little bit   he told bbc sport.  i ve dominated all the top ten players. they say nice things about me because i have beaten them all. i am dominating the game right now and i hope it continues!  the number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court. he has just been voted  by the international tennis writers  as the best  ambassador for tennis  on the atp tour. he has time for everyone. every match  from first round to final  is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages; english  french and swiss-german. after a major win  there are extra requests  obligations and interviews  all seen through to the end with courtesy and  most importantly  good humour.  you guys are funny  i have a good time with you guys   he said  genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder.  i see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me.  if i can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me. people say thanks back and that is nice.  what a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade. it sums up his modest personality. shortly after collecting a waterford crystal trophy  a mercedes convertible and a tasty cheque for $1.5m  federer addressed the houston crowd and concluded by saying  thanks for having me . now he just needs to find a way of winning the french open  the one grand slam to so far elude him.
politics,howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour s manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.  the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget. mr blair derided tory claims they could cut £35bn in  wasteful spending  saying the party had got its sums wrong. the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. mr howard told mps that  every independent expert  from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the  government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes . mr blair replied:  i think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right.  the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn  although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.  they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats have said the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform  with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the  authentic opposition   particularly on the iraq war  council tax and university tuition fees. labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a  fraudulent prospectus .
sport,benitez joy as reds take control liverpool boss rafael benitez was satisfied after his team s 3-1 win over bayer leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute.   before the game if you had said the score will be 3-1 i would have happily accepted that   said benitez.  but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level.  i have confidence that we can complete the task in germany. i am always confident and we must be positive.   benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek  whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov s weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg.  for me it was not jerzy dudek s fault   added benitez.  he had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances  nobody would be talking about about their goal. it would not have mattered.  if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal.  in my opinion jerzy played well  made two very fine saves - and i am happy with him.  if we lose 2-0 we are out but i think we can score in germany - certainly one  and that will make all the difference.  and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard  who was suspended for the anfield leg  back for the return in germany.   steven gerrard is a key player for us   said benitez.  when he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others.  steven is one of the best players in the world  but i need a team that is not about just one player. there must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well.
sport,wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager.  the ex-england coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed dave jones  who was sacked after the club s poor start to the season. wolves chairman rick hayward said:  we re delighted glenn is here. he has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works.  hoddle  who will work alongside stuart gray  has been out of the game since he was sacked by spurs in 2003. gray  who has been caretaker manager  was assistant boss when hoddle was manager at southampton.  i m delighted to be here   said hoddle.   i saw the massive potential that wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the premiership parallels my ambitions.  stuart gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. we ve worked together at southampton and i m delighted to be back with him.  wolves chief executive jez moxey defended the decision to give hoddle a short-term contract.  we hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term   he said.  most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn t work out.  for somebody of glenn s calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line  it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here.  hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones  departure.  he was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things   he explained.  five weeks later we re back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for wolves.   hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job. his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. the 47-year-old later returned to management with southampton  where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves. he engineered an upturn in saints  fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season. since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton. wolves are currently 17th in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday.
politics,tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders  according to the hansard society.  it would then be up to tony blair  michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part  the non-partisan charity said. chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter  of public interest .  the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead   he said.  lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry. he said it was a  democratically dubious proposition  that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here.  if mr blair did not want to take part  the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why  lord holme said.  what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate  no-one has heard directly from the prime minister   he said.  it has been left to nudges and winks  hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one  but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself.   lord holme  who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections  said broadcasters were  more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements . opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes  he said.  lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations  broadcasters  should make the decision to go ahead  as soon as the election is called. an independent third-party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public  he said.  it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse   said lord holme.   if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part  he would then be obliged to say why publicly.  the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons  or going ahead with an empty chair.  either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto.  the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. last month he said:  we answer this every election campaign and  for the reasons i have given before  the answer is no   he said at his monthly news conference.
sport,wenger handed summer war chest arsenal boss arsene wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer.  the club s managing director  keith edelman  stressed that the development of their new £350m stadium had no affect on wenger s spending power.  the money is there. don t worry we ve got it   edelman told bbc sport.  hopefully  we ll spend it this summer and in the coming years. arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong.   edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings.  its great to have nice  new surroundings  but if the team aren t performing on the pitch  then there isn t great respect in having a fabulous stadium   he said.  it s important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place  before we began on the stadium.
sport,wenger rules out new keeper arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window.  wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the new year. but he told the evening standard:  i don t feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january.  the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia has made to his career at highbury. and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with chelsea on sunday.  almunia was at fault for rosenborg s goal in arsenal s 5-1 champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week s win over birmingham. but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media.  the debate has gone on too long. everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it   wenger added. arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer  fulham s edwin van der sar and parma s sebastien frey. and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester.
politics,uk  needs true immigration data  a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration.  barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. she said this would counter  so-called independent  groups like migration watch  which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. sir andrew green  chairman of the organisation  says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate. he says he opposes large-scale immigration  both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture .  he said:  for example  over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration.  we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france.  ms roche  labour mp for hornsey and wood green  believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean  we wouldn t have so-called independent experts  like migration watch  who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.  she went on:  what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures  published them  and was independent of government.  i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.
sport,slovakia reach hopman cup final slovakia will play argentina in the final of the hopman cup after beating group b rivals the netherlands 3-0.  daniela hantuchova defeated michaella krajicek 6-4 6-2 to give the slovaks the perfect start before dutchman peter wessels retired against dominik hrbaty. wessels was unable to compete in the mixed doubles but slovakia had already booked their place in the final for the second year running. argentina claimed top spot in group a with three wins from three matches. in the other group b match  the united states defeated australia 2-1.  meghann shaughnessy lost the opening match against alicia molik but james blake levelled the tie with a 6-3 6-4 win over paul baccanello  who came in as a replacement for the injured mark philippoussis. blake and shaughnessy then beat molik and baccanello in a tense mixed doubles contest to take the win. hantuchova  who did not win a hopman cup singles match in 2004  has been in good form during this year s event and has won two of her three matches.  i feel like it s really deserved this time as i ve helped dominik to get through   she said.  i think if i keep going the way i have been in the past few matches then i will be okay.  i was really pleased with my last two singles  even the first one  which was a really high standard.  you can t ask for a better preparation than to play a few matches here for the australian open.

sport,tevez - an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.  he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression  but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today   gandula  is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then  and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil.  the new maradona  - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil  where the argentine championship is not shown.  presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north  rather than across the atlantic. argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo  forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be  disorganized.  hounded by the press  tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of  tranquillity.  anyone acquainted with the city of s&#227;o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazil s biggest city is a sprawling  ugly  restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants.  but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them  reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays  when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez  then  can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores  south america s champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed  he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s&#227;o paulo state championship  an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players  tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left  to pass when he was expected to dribble  to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.
politics,election  could be terror target  terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election  london s most senior police officer has said.  sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and g8  he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.  the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals  warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be  unwise  to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said:  terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate.   this year we are responsible for the eu presidency  presidency of the g8  a royal wedding and a general election.  there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with.  sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians  not the police  who would enforce any new powers.  home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian s comments  the prime minister s official spokesman said:  we believe the threat is real.  the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier  writing in the daily telegraph  the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were  difficult issues for any government . the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition  with the government s majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted:  there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack.   tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of  using national security for political point scoring . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s  authoritarian  response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.
politics,uk heading wrong way - howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.
politics,blair returns from peace mission prime minister tony blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the middle east to try to resurrect the peace process.  mr blair held talks with his israeli counterpart  ariel sharon  and the palestinian leader  mahmoud abbas. he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march. mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week. the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah - the first world leader to do so. he nodded briefly towards the tomb  rather than lay a wreath  in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.  the bbc s paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas  also known as abu mazen  who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on 9 january. at a news conference following talks with mr blair  mr abbas said the british prime minister was  in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit . he added:  your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.  in an interview with the bbc s political editor andrew marr  mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be  tough  but at least we have got the first step . mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis  but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism. he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process  not the end of it. earlier  mr sharon again said he had not seen  the slightest step  the palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. before visiting israel  mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq  where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city. he was briefed on preparations for the national poll  which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed.
sport,curbishley delight for johansson charlton manager alan curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker jonatan johansson after beating norwich.  curbishley said after the 4-0 win:  there was talk about norwich being interested in the summer but i have a lot of faith in jonatan.  when there was talk of other clubs i just told him he was going nowhere.  he s part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on. i m sure he s happy here  but i was delighted with all the players.  curbishley was subjected to criticism from charlton fans recently  and he said:  the thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction.  that s happened for however long i ve been here and we don t want people taking sides.
politics,top tories on lib dem  hit list  the liberal democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top tories - including leader michael howard - at the next general election.  mr howard s seat is at the top of the liberal democrats  list. others targeted include oliver letwin  david davis and theresa may  lib dem s elections chief lord rennard said. he said it was  nothing personal  but that  very many of the prominent conservatives  had slender leads in seats where the lib dems were second.  in 2001  michael howard won the folkestone & hythe seat with 20 645 votes  compared to 14 738 for the liberal democrat candidate peter carroll  giving the tory leader a majority of 5 907. asked if this amounted to the party s much vaunted  decapitation strategy  lord rennard said it was not a term he had ever used. but he urged labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent conservatives.  i just don t think labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a conservative.  he denied this strategy was opportunism  insisting the lib dem s policies on issues such as tuition fees  the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed  to all sides of the political spectrum .  we are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote liberal democrat   he added. a conservative spokesperson said:  the liberal democrats can talk all they like about strategy. the problem the liberal democrats face is that a large number of lib dem voters do not agree with their policies.  we will be pointing out how they are soft on crime  how they support higher taxes  their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving europe more control over our lives .
sport,kenyon denies robben barca return chelsea chief executive peter kenyon has played down reports that arjen robben will return for the champions league match against barcelona.   he s been responding well to treatment and started running on friday  but we ll have to wait and see   he told bbc five live s sportsweek.  we re looking to getting him back as soon as possible  but he ll be back when it s right for him and for us.  there s no plans at the moment around the barcelona game.  his comments contradict those of chiropractor jean pierre meersseman who treated the dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of february. robben had been expected to be out for six weeks  but meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital stamford bridge game on 8 march.  i hope he can be back and i will try to help him make that happen   meersseman told the mail on sunday.  i put everything right with arjen s foot the last time i saw him 12 days ago. it was an obvious correction and easy to perform.  i know he was pleased with what i did and now that he is running again. i am due to see him one more time again in the next few days.  meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at italian side ac milan.
politics,blair labour s longest-serving pm tony blair has become the labour party s longest-serving prime minister.  the 51-year-old premier has marked his 2 838th day in the post  overtaking the combined length of harold wilson s two terms during the 1960s and 1970s. if mr blair wins the next election and fulfils his promise to serve a full third term  he will surpass margaret thatcher s 11 years by the end of 2008. in 1997  mr blair became the youngest premier of the 20th century  when he came to power at the age of 43. the last prime minister to be installed at a younger age was lord liverpool  who was a year his junior in 1812.  mr blair s other political firsts include becoming the first labour leader to win two successive full terms in power after the 2001 labour landslide. and the birth of the blairs  fourth child  leo  on 20 may  2000  was the first child born to a serving prime minister in more than 150 years. the last  downing street dad  was lord john russell in 1848. labour won a huge majority of 167 over the conservatives in 2001  but mr blair has since been criticised by many in his own party. the war in iraq and reforms of the health service and education system have provoked dissent from backbenchers.  gordon brown  chancellor of the exchequer under mr blair  became britain s longest-serving chancellor of modern times in 2004. former labour leader lord kinnock said the chancellor would be best placed to take over from mr blair. when asked about the future leadership of the party  he told itv wales  waterfront programme:  that contest is a long way away and it will occur only when the prime minister  tony blair  decides he s subscribed all he can and then wants to go.  i think that the main contender will be gordon brown  who is a man of virtually unmatched capability and now great experience.  both mr brown and mr blair rose to prominence when lord kinnock led labour between 1983 and 1992.
sport,bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was  not good enough  for the magpies. bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness. souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said bellamy did not score enough goals  the chap that s just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren t even in the top flight   said souness.  that s not good enough for a striker at a club like this.  we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.   bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week  souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying.   there are certain things you can forgive and forget   said souness.  but if i d been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle.  he could then return to st james  park - and he says that he wants to. however  it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge.
sport,o gara revels in ireland victory ireland fly-half ronan o gara hailed his side s 19-13 victory over england as a  special  win.  the munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points  including two drop goals  to help keep alive their grand slam hopes. he told bbc sport:  we made hard work of it but it s still special to beat england.  i had three chances to win the game but didn t. we have work to do after this but we never take a victory over england lightly.  ireland hooker shane byrne echoed o gara s comments but admitted the game had been england s best outing in the six nations. byrne said:  it was a really  really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really  really hard.  we just had to stick to our defensive pattern  trust ourselves and trust those around us. all round it was fantastic.  ireland captain brian o driscoll  who scored his side s only try  said:  we are delighted  we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter.  we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you ve just got to jump on the back of it.   ireland coach eddie o sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.  andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldn t see whether he was offside or not so i don t know how andy could have known   said o sullivan.   what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us.  we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team.  i think our try was very well worked  it was a gem  as good a try as we have scored for a while.  o sullivan also rejected robinson s contention england dominated the forward play.  i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i don t know how that adds up to domination   he said. o driscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title.  this season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites  tag   he said.  hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so.  as for my try it was a move we had worked on all week. there was a bit of magic from geordan murphy and it was a great break from denis hickie.
politics,at a glance: tory health checks the uk  opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. here s a guide to the plan:  people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb  they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. all people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.  tuberculosis  hepatitis b and hiv. a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. all other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.  people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk  or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. they would also  if appropriate  have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.  people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care  childcare or teaching. children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb. under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv.  the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health. however  they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.  they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. they also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. they say the plans will protect access to the nhs.  applicants will be tested in their home country. only asylum seekers will be tested in the uk once their refugee status is established.  home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries. recent medical checks were carried out on 175 000 people at heathrow airport and 10 000 at gatwick. from those tests  about 100 infectious cases of tb were found.  the tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. the party has looked at the way the system is operated in australia  canada and new zealand. the tory proposals are  quite closely modelled  on the new zealand system.  labour claims the policy is little more than a  desperate attempt to catch up with labour s five-year plan  for immigration and asylum  which was published last week. this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. the liberal democrats have warned labour and the tories they were  in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it .

sport,houllier praises benitez regime former liverpool manager gerard houllier has praised the work of his anfield successor rafael benitez.  houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of benitez since the spaniard took over at liverpool. but houllier told bbc sport:  in private and in public  i have stressed i believe rafa is doing a good job. he is the right man at the right place.  rafa is a good coach and a good man. i ve spoken to him since he has been at liverpool and never criticised him.  houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving liverpool in may following six years at anfield.  the former france boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed mark hughes as wales national coach. he has been working for uefa  covering the premiership for french television and also coaching in brazil with national coach carlos alberto perreira. houllier said:  if a good club comes up at the right time then yes  i am ready to come back.  it has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and i have learned things.  i have been involved in football since leaving liverpool and my batteries are recharged.   houllier has been impressed with the quality in the premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with jose mourinho s work at leaders chelsea. he said:  chelsea are doing very well. they have some very good creative players in damien duff and arjen robben and didier drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against newcastle.  they have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. they have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with jose s principles.  jose had results before he came to chelsea and i think he will have an impact in the premiership because he manages his team very cleverly.  and houllier  away from his brief at liverpool  has been hugely impressed with the premiership. he said:  it is a very exciting league. it is entertaining  goals are scored and teams are always trying to win.  it has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective.  games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the premiership than other leagues. it is a very good product.
sport,european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us  well  i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects.  it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward  to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.  the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the 60m hurdles. running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. but what was great about sunday s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah. and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head-to-head race will give sarah confidence. in the men s race on saturday  allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. in fact  the men s 60m hurdles is so strong  i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid.  phillips idowu lit up the field events  not only with his hair  but also with his leap of 17.30m  which puts him at the top of the world rankings. i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then phillips always has. a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful  so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance. he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. she picked up three personal bests in the long jump  high jump and 60m hurdles and you can t ask for more than that. kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far.  she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. it wasn t all good news in sheffield. i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. jason gardener may have won but he wasn t at his best. i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. he s there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. in the women s race  jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka. the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection. if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.  janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn t be the case. the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her. a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf. findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain. yusuf  who came third in the 400m  is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship. he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe  started doing more running and found his talent. so we shall have to see what happens to both of them.
politics,candidate resigns over bnp link a prospective candidate for the uk independence party (ukip) has resigned after admitting a  brief attachment  to the british national party(bnp).  nicholas betts-green  who had been selected to fight the suffolk coastal seat  quit after reports in a newspaper that he attended a bnp meeting. the former teacher confirmed he had attended the meeting but said that was the only contact he had with the group. mr betts-green resigned after being questioned by the party s leadership. a ukip spokesman said mr betts-green s resignation followed disclosures in the east anglian daily times last month about his attendance at a bnp meeting.  he did once attend a bnp meeting. he did not like what he saw and heard and will take no further part of it   the spokesman added. a meeting of suffolk coastal ukip members is due to be held next week to discuss a replacement. mr betts-green  of woodbridge  suffolk  has also resigned as ukip s branch chairman.

politics,brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid.  he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign  and praised his handling of the economy.  writing in the guardian newspaper  mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking.  as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear  labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance  disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education  good health and sustainable communities.  bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was  a warning shot  to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.  it was  as always  coded and careful... but entirely deliberate   was mr marr s assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be  central . mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was  in part  because of mr brown s management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a  centrepiece  of labour s manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a  tough  tough fight  for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking  nothing for granted  ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.
sport,rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions.  rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal s 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers  hero  saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson. striker novo secured victory  lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining. it ended celtic s 11-game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals. celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch  including twice already this season. they started confidently  with new signing bellamy  on loan from newcastle united  given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield. it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten  taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt. he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy s disappointing low drive from 16 yards. waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian. but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out. hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box  but the striker s shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus. rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal  collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen  broke the deadlock  douglas somehow letting the frenchman s dipping drive slip through his grasp. novo pounced on a moments  hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas. ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin  but it could not prevent rangers  celebrations at the final whistle.  : douglas  mcnamara  balde  varga  laursen  petrov  lennon  sutton  thompson  bellamy  hartson.  subs: marshall  henchoz  juninho paulista  lambert  maloney  wallace  mcgeady.  : waterreus  hutton  kyrgiakos  andrews  ball  buffel  ferguson  ricksen  vignal  prso  novo.  subs: mcgregor  namouchi  burke  alex rae  malcolm  thompson  lovenkrands.  : m mccurry
politics,new  yob  targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.  ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago  ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2 600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders  breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed.  we have not defeated this problem by any means  but shown together what can be done   he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws  saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25 000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos  they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that  about a third  of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.
sport,holmes is hit by hamstring injury kelly holmes has been forced out of this weekend s european indoor athletics championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training.  the double olympic champion said:  i am very disappointed that i have been forced to withdraw.  i can hardly walk at the moment and i won t be able to do any running for two or three weeks although i ll be keeping fit as best i can.  holmes will have now have intensive treatment in south africa.  the 34-year-old made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the 1 000m title at the birmingham grand prix 10 days ago. after that race and more progress in training  holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the european indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend.  on saturday night i pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night   said holmes.  i was going really  really well when i felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew.  i saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it s frustrating missing madrid when i knew i was in great shape.  holmes has now been advised by her coach margot jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer. helen clitheroe now goes to madrid as the only british competitor in the women s 1500m while there will be no representative in the 800m.
sport,capriati out of australian open jennifer capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the australian open because of injury.  the organisers of the first grand slam of 2005  which begins on 17 january  said the american has a problem with her right shoulder. it comes as a blow to the women s draw as last year s champion  justin henin-hardenne  and runner-up  kim clijsters  will also be absent. capriati is a two-time champion in melbourne with wins in 2001 and 2002. she is believed to have picked up the injury at the advanta championships at philadelphia in november and had to pull out of an exhibition match with wimbledon champion maria sharapova on 17 december. capriati also decided against competing in the australian open warm-up event  the sydney international.

sport,clyde 0-5 celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semi-final  but only after a nervy and testing first half.  the home side s craig bryson had a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead. alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled. stilian petrov slid in a third  varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on  saving from bellamy  chris sutton and juninho. clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from bryson  but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov. from the resulting free kick  darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him. back at the other end  halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy s effort to lift the ball over him. the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide  but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net.  maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound  he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty. sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from 12 yards. varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage - thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady  jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net. halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a mcgeady shot wide as the game petered out.  halliwell  mensing  bollan  balmer  potter  sheridan (burns 61)  arbuckle (gilhaney 61)  gibson  bryson (jones 78)  malone  harty.  morrison  wilson.  mensing  sheridan.  douglas  henchoz  mcnamara  balde  varga  juninho paulista  thompson  lennon (lambert 70)  sutton (maloney 45)  petrov (mcgeady 70)  bellamy.  marshall  laursen.  thompson  bellamy.  : varga 40  thompson 48 pen  petrov 60  varga 68  bellamy 72.  8 200  c thomson

politics,kilroy-silk attacked with slurry euro mp robert kilroy-silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in manchester.  the uk independence party member was arriving for a bbc radio show when the attacker emerged from behind a bush. fellow guest ruth kelly mp was also hit by the slurry. mr kilroy-silk said the man  who later disappeared  claimed he was  doing it in the name of islam . in january  mr kilroy-silk quit his bbc one show for remarks he made about arabs  who he called  suicide bombers .  mr kilroy-silk had already been taken off air by bbc bosses for the comments  in which he also described arabs as  limb-amputators  women repressors . the remarks prompted outrage among muslim groups. the slurry attack took place on friday as mr kilroy-silk and ms kelly  a cabinet office minister and bolton west mp  arrived at manchester high school for girls for the recording of bbc radio 4 s any questions.  the police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. they are treating the incident as assault. the programme s host  jonathan dimbleby  later told the audience the mep had been covered from  head to toe . mr kilroy-silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.  he told reporters he was  very angry  and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. he said the man shouted:  you ve offended my religion  i m doing this in the name of islam.   as i started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car   mr kilroy-silk said.  i was totally covered  it was all through my clothes  and it stank to high heaven. it went all inside the car and splattered ruth kelly.  a bbc spokesman said:  he took his seat as jonathan dimbleby was introducing the show. fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have.  greater manchester police said people near mr kilroy-silk had also been hit by the waste. officers took statements at the scene  but no arrests have been made. police say the suspect ran off after towards wilmslow road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red vauxhall corsa earlier. the suspect is described as white  aged 30 to 40  with a ginger beard. police want to hear from anyone who has any information.  mr kilroy-silk  an mep for the east midlands  resigned the uk independence party whip in the european parliament in october  after criticising ukip and stating his ambition to be leader. however  he remains a member of the party. he said on friday he hoped to be elected party leader before christmas.  i think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the general election.  but a ukip spokesman said that would be impossible under the party s constitution  which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.
sport,white prepared for battle tough-scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england s six nations opener in cardiff on saturday.  the leicester tight-head is in the form of his life  making the england number three shirt his own. but he knows wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny.  the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with   he told bbc sport.  they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.  white is also impressed with the welsh pack s strength in depth.  gethin jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. he has played a bit at tight-head but i think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good   he added. the 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  he destroyed south africa s os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. leicester  who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of 2003  have also been aided by white s presence this season. the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup.  i am pleased with my form   he said.  but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester - people like martin johnson and graham rowntree.  it s been a good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants.  i am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.  white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday. injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill  jonny wilkinson  martin corry  mike tindall  will greenwood and stuart abbott.  and with 27 caps and a world cup winner s medal to his name  white is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon.  i don t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way   he added.  when i first came into the squad  people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.   it gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you.  i was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.  white missed the vast majority of last year s six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in cardiff.  i enjoy the atmosphere. the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world   he said.  to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it s one of my favourite places to play.  this is probably the most even six nations for a long time. england  ireland  france and wales are all contenders.  on form  ireland should be favourites but you just don t know - that s the great thing about this tournament.
politics,fox attacks blair s tory  lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign  say the tories.  tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a  hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio:  if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war  i guess you are going to lie about anything at all.  he would not discuss reports the party repaid £500 000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.  the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date  but it is widely expected to be 5 may.  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday  mr blair said:  i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street.  he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric  then struggling to live up to the expectations  and reaching the point of raised voices and  throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency  saying:  it s a fight for the future of our country  it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win.   mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy  it would result in  a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents  policies and then attacking the lies.  what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear   he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as  vacuous  and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500 000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.  we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters   he said  insisting he enjoyed a  warm and constructive  relationship to lord ashcroft.  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester  liverpool  leicester  somerset  basingstoke  shrewsbury  dorset and torbay. he said:  this is three-party politics. in the northern cities  the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats.  in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives  who are out of the running in scotland and wales.  the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a  touchy-feely  speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.
politics,what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays   one starbucks  one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens. both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters  with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories  new headquarters in victoria street  just down the road from the commons. that should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. unlike 2001  there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside  or to buy scooters  to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events.  and  to all intents and purposes  we already appear to be in that general election campaign. certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn  in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event.   welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre   he said. and i ll bet he hadn t checked that one with gordon brown. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy  he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme  which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300 000 in unemployment. and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save £35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £4 billion of tax cuts. labour has come up with a figure of £22 billions worth of efficiency savings so  understandably perhaps  believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra £13 billion. these figures  based on the two parties  own detailed studies  will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. wednesday was just the start.

sport,coach ranieri sacked by valencia claudio ranieri has been sacked as valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the primera liga club for the second time in his career.  the decision was taken at a board meeting following the side s surprise elimination from the uefa cup.  we understand  and he understands  that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate   said club president juan bautista. former assistant antonio lopez will take over as the new coach. italian ranieri took over the valencia job in june 2004 having been replaced at chelsea by jose mourinho.  things began well but the spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to racing santander last weekend. that defeat was then followed by a uefa cup exit at the hands of steaua bucharest. ranieri first took charge of valencia in 1997  guiding them to the king s cup and helping them to qualify for the champions league. the 54-year-old then moved to atletico madrid in 1999  before joining chelsea the following year.
sport,england  to launch ref protest  england will protest to the international rugby board (irb) about the referee s performance in the defeat by ireland  reports the daily mail.  england coach andy robinson has called on ex-international referees colin high and steve lander to analyse several of jonathan kaplan s decisions.  i want to go through the tape with colin and steve   robinson told the daily mail.  i want to speak to the irb about it. i think only one side was refereed.  high  the rugby football union s referees  manager  claimed kaplan made three major errors which changed the outcome of sunday s match. england were beaten 19-13 by the irish in dublin  their third straight defeat in the 2005 six nations.  the international rugby board will be disappointed   high told the daily mail.  jonathan kaplan is in the top 20 in the world but that wasn t an international performance.  it would not have been acceptable in the zurich premiership.  if one of my referees had done that  i would have had my backside kicked for making the appointment.  if any english referee refereed like that in a european match  there would be an inquest. no question about that.  if someone had performed like that  he would have been pulled from the next game.
sport,angry williams rejects criticism serena williams has angrily rejected claims that she and sister venus are a declining force in tennis.  the sisters ended last year without a grand slam title for the first time since 1998. but serena denied their challenge was fading  saying:  that s not fair - i m tired of not saying anything.  we ve been practising hard. we ve had serious injuries. i ve had surgery and after  i got to the wimbledon final. i don t know many who have done that.  while serena is through to the australian open semi-finals  venus went out in the fourth round  meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five grand slam appearances. but serena added:  venus had a severe strain in her stomach. i actually had the same injury  but i didn t tear it the way she did.   if i would have torn it  i wouldn t have been here.  she played a player (alicia molik) that just played out of her mind and venus made some errors that she probably shouldn t have made.  serena also said people tended to forget the impact the 2003 murder of sister yetunde price had had on the family.  to top it off  we have a very  very  very  very  very close family  serena continued.  to be in some situation that we ve been placed in in the past little over a year  it s not easy to come out and just perform at your best when you realize there are so many things that are so important.  so  no  we re not declining. we re here. i don t have to win this tournament to prove anything. i know that i m out here and i know that i m one of the best players out here.
politics,brown calls for £5.5bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine.  on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa  the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives  mr brown said on thursday. he hopes to use the uk s g8 presidency to push the issue forward.   i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat  cure and eradicate the world s deadliest disease of today - and today the world s least curable disease - hiv/aids - will rightly earn the title  the great generation    mr brown said in a speech during his african tour. the problems of hiv/aids were inseparable from poverty  he added.  at least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the hiv/aids crisis in low and middle income countries.  existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic.  the uk s proposal for an international finance facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (£27bn). a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty.  mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.  currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting  mr brown said. he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each  thereby boosting the market for inoculations. this would be a  large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms   mr brown added.  more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv/aids and their families  he said. but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown s preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g8 nations to fund hiv/aids treatments. the charity s head of hiv/aids in britain  simon wright said:  while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important  a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death.  hiv is decimating african countries  killing the most productive adults who should be working  caring for children and building the economy. an hiv vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. treatments are needed now.  on wednesday  mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi . he will visit an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women s credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town. the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two.
sport,iaaf awaits greek pair s response kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the international association of athletics federations (iaaf).  the greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens. they have until midnight on 16 december and an iaaf spokesman said:  we re sure their responses are on their way.  if they do not respond or their explanations are rejected  they will be provisionally banned from competition. they will then face a hearing in front of the greek federation  which will ultimately determine their fate. their former coach christos tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. under iaaf rules  the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension. kenteris and thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.  no date for the trial has yet been set and again tzekos is also facing charges. the iaaf issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete  where they had said they would be. all athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times  so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago  when they decided to fly back to greece early. then just before the olympics  the pair dramatically missed another test in athens and withdrew from the games.
sport,arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane.  there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen s role at the club.  it is absolutely not true   arnesen told bbc radio five live.  there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems.  he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself.  arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. he added:  jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. but i trust him in that; you have to accept it. i think we should respect it.   the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation.  arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement  coming less than 24 hours before tottenham s premiership fixture with charlton.  when it comes down to personal problems  i don t think we should talk about timing   he said. and he also denied reports that santini had been given a £3m pay-off.  that is absolute nonsense. he is the one who said  i will go  and so he went    said the spurs sporting director. tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.   i have confidence in this structure. i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing   he said. however  former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift.  i think the problems go a lot deeper  between the director of football at white hart lane and santini   stevens told five live.  on paper they could have worked together. but frank arnesen was a very creative  forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas i think santini was very much the opposite  more a case of being organised  disciplined and happy not conceding goals.  that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. but it seems that has not happened.

sport,wilkinson return  unlikely  jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the 2005 rbs six nations.  england s world cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship. but rob andrew  coach of wilkinson s club side newcastle  said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time.  it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match   andrew told the times. wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries. he has not played for england since the world cup final in november 2003  since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches. wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on 13 march.  that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland.  we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight  but it is touch and go   said andrew.  his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal-kicking.  he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a test match.  we can t afford to get it wrong with a knee injury. we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it.  despite not playing for england  wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer. lions coach sir clive woodward has not set a deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.
sport,ireland 17-12 south africa ronan o gara scored all ireland s points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road.  o gara s first-half try  poached after a quick tap-penalty  helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o gara penalties extended ireland s lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led  but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans  ireland pressed hard from the outset  and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on  denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan s pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss.  ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland s first points - o gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score  the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy s ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however  the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland s lead to 5-3.  ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure  the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o gara s clever drop-goal to restore his side s lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o gara penalty. however  montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland s lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.  in the 61st minute  hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however  a late tackle on brian o driscoll enabled o gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland s lead to 17-6. however  two montgomery penalties had ireland s lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.  g dempsey; g murphy  b o driscoll (capt)  s horgan  d hickie; r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes  m o kelly  p o connell  s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  k maggs.  : p montgomery; b paulse  m joubert  de wet barry  a willemse  j van der westhuyzen; f du preez; o du randt  j smit (captain)  e andrews  b botha  v matfield  s burger  aj venter  j van niekerk.  : h shimange  cj van der linde  g britz  d rossouw  m claassens  j de villiers  g du toit/j fourie.  paul honiss (new zealand)
politics,kennedy criticises  unfair  taxes gordon brown has failed to tackle the  fundamental unfairness  in the tax system in his ninth budget  charles kennedy has said.  how was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%  the lib dem leader asked. the new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the  unfair tax   he added. the government could not go on  patching up  the system  he added. speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election  mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world.  but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the  ticking bomb  of council tax revaluation. he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation. the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a £200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a  sticking plaster  to a much bigger problem. the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year  with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.  on pensions  mr kennedy said it was a  scandal  that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children. he said a residency criteria would end  at a stroke this fundamental iniquity . mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long-term care for the elderly  abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100 000 per annum. he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax. the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election.  for most individuals  most families  most households  it adds up to exactly the same thing   said mr kennedy.  and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.
sport,radcliffe yet to answer gb call paula radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the world cross-country championships.  the 31-year-old is concerned the event  which starts on 19 march in france  could upset her preparations for the london marathon on 17 april.  there is no question that paula would be a huge asset to the gb team   said zara hyde peters of uk athletics.  but she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training.  radcliffe must make a decision by tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. british team member hayley yelling said the team would understand if radcliffe opted out of the event.  it would be fantastic to have paula in the team   said the european cross-country champion.  but you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus.  she is not messing us around. we all understand the problem.  radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year s event because of injury. in her absence  the gb team won bronze in brussels.
politics,eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis  the uk s public spending watchdog has said.  the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling  the eu still had no common definition of fraud. it also expressed concern that  for the 10th year  the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts. the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. the report said:  member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european anti-fraud office on a consistent basis.   as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade  it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources.  it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003  worth £38.5m (52m euros)  up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. at the same time  reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from 10 276 cases worth £808m to 8 177 cases worth £644m. edward leigh  chairman of the commons public accounts committee  said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency.   any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer  given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community   he said.  departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that they re doing everything possible to weed out improper spending.  the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity  and raise overall standards of financial management.  a spokesman for the european anti-fraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao s assessment of fraud reporting.  the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state  and there is room for improvement   spokesman jorg wojahn said. he added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud  with the statistics studied by nao providing a  good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud .
sport,celtic unhappy over bulgaria date martin o neill hopes to block stilian petrov s call-up by bulgaria during celtic s busy festive programme.  the celtic manager does not view the friendly against valenciana - a region of spain - on 28 december as important.  i can t say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas   said o neill.  we will have to speak with the bulgarian fa. it s their prerogative for them to arrange a fixture and our prerogative how we handle it.  bulgaria s game comes between celtic s boxing day meeting with hearts and their 2 january fixture against livingston. o neill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury.  they have organised a game at a rather awkward time   he added.  when we were out playing barcelona  i spoke with the bulgarian manager  hristo stoichkov  and he mentioned this game to me.  we pay his wages  we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit  rather than anyone else.  i have said this before  but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games.
sport,adriano s chelsea link rejected adriano s agent gilmar rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with chelsea over the striker.  chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about inter milan s 22-year-old brazilian star. rinaldi told bbc sport from rio de janeiro:  i can assure you that chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or adriano.  parma and real madrid are interested but there s nothing new there. their interest has been known for some time.  adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 serie a appearances this season. and chelsea boss jose mourinho had claimed that he was in milan talking to adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with arsenal defender ashley cole. mourinho said he was  just practising my portuguese with him because i don t need strikers . rinaldi told bbc sport:  i have to say that nobody from chelsea or any other london club has contacted me.  if they want to  that s fine. i can tell them what the situation is.  if chelsea are interested then they must make an offer.  inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of £40m on the head of adriano  who joined them just over a year ago from parma. real madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot ronaldo. but rinaldi said:  i cannot give you a price that inter would accept for adriano. that s something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs.
politics,borders rail link campaign rally campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened.  they will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure  which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle  with a walk at tweedbank. anne borthwick  of campaign for borders rail  said reopening the waverley line would restore the area s prosperity. msps are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through midlothian to the borders. campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line  which could cost up to £100m  would be a huge economic boost for the borders.  in 2000  borders council said the area s economy had suffered since the closure. ms borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the scottish executive.  we are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the waverley line   she said.  campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle.   we believe that it is time for the scottish executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between edinburgh and tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future.  ms borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the scottish borders. a study in 2000  which was commissioned by the executive  scottish borders council  midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise  found that a half-hourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs. it also found that a half-hourly service from gorebridge to edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the west coast main line at longtown could also be reinstated.
politics,jack cunningham to stand down veteran labour mp and former cabinet minister jack cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election.  one of the few blair-era ministers to serve under jim callaghan  he was given the agriculture portfolio when labour regained power in 1997. mr cunningham went on to become tony blair s  cabinet enforcer . he has represented the constituency now known as copeland since 1970. mr blair said he was a  huge figure  in labour and a  valued  personal friend .  during labour s long period in opposition  mr cunningham held a number of shadow roles including foreign affairs  the environment and as trade spokesman. as agriculture minister he caused controversy when he decided to ban beef on the bone in the wake of fears over bse. he quit the government in 1999 and in recent years has served as the chairman of the all-party committee on lords reform and has been a loyal supporter of the government from the backbenches.
sport,spain coach faces racism inquiry spain s football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry.  if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about £22 000. the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october. but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain s anti-violence commission. aragones insisted the comments  made to henry s arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes  were meant to motivate the player  and were not intended to be offensive.   i never intended to offend anyone  and for that reason i have a very easy conscience   he said at the time.  i m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results.  as part of that job  i use colloquial language  with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world.   england s players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month.  but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england s black players during the game  which spain won 1-0. spain s minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation s decision.  everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations  and make sure they do not give a negative image   he said.  we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism.
politics,fox attacks blair s tory  lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign  say the tories.  tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a  hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio:  if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war  i guess you are going to lie about anything at all.  he would not discuss reports the party repaid £500 000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.  the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date  but it is widely expected to be 5 may.  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday  mr blair said:  i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street.  he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric  then struggling to live up to the expectations  and reaching the point of raised voices and  throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency  saying:  it s a fight for the future of our country  it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win.   mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy  it would result in  a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents  policies and then attacking the lies.  what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear   he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as  vacuous  and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500 000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.  we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters   he said  insisting he enjoyed a  warm and constructive  relationship to lord ashcroft.  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester  liverpool  leicester  somerset  basingstoke  shrewsbury  dorset and torbay. he said:  this is three-party politics. in the northern cities  the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats.  in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives  who are out of the running in scotland and wales.  the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a  touchy-feely  speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.
sport,dunne keen to commit to man city richard dunne is ready to commit his long-term future to manchester city after turning his career around.  he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances  prompting interest from other clubs. early talks have taken place and the defender said:  hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible.  i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here.  newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne s turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window. but the 25-year-old dubliner underlined his intention to stay at eastlands. he added:  it s nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do.  i really enjoy it at city and i want to keep that going.  keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in january. dunne s professionalism was famously questioned by keegan  who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state.  but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said:  i ve grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad.  i ve played more games than any other outfield players this season so i can t be regarded as being a kid any more.  i have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough  defensively we ve done quite well.  keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper nicky weaver makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at blackburn on tuesday. former england under-21 keeper weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries  which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.
sport,ferguson fears milan cutting edge manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said his side s task against ac milan would not be made any easier by the absence of andriy shevchenko.  milan s talismanic european footballer of the year misses wednesday s champions league first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone.  it s a loss (to milan)  but it could be worse if they didn t have such quality to bring in   ferguson said.  how much they miss him i think they ll know tomorrow night.  ferguson said milan s front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders.  they can play rui costa and play kaka forward. they can bring serginho in and they can play (jon dahl) tomasson   he said. ferguson s own goalscoring talisman ruud van nistelrooy is fit again  but the scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the dutchman  who has not played for three months.   ruud is the best striker in europe. what i have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long   he said.  his ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.  ferguson  though  is confident his young players  particularly wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo  are up to the task.  we have an opportunity to win this cup this year  no question about that   he declared.  with the maturity we see every week in ronaldo and rooney  the return of van nistelrooy and the form of roy keane  paul scholes and ryan giggs  we must have a fantastic chance.  it is a view shared by rooney  who believes  if we can get past milan  we have a great chance .  as soon as i knew we were playing milan  i got excited. looking at the draw  it is anyone s trophy but we have every chance.  hopefully  we can get to that final in turkey and bring the cup back to manchester.  milan coach carlo ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted europe s most prestigious club title two seasons ago. milan beat juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at old trafford and ancelotti said:  we are all very happy to return (to old trafford) to play in the champions league and this will give us great motivation.  ancelotti said he was aware of the threat united posed to his hopes of champions league glory.  it s fundamental that we don t allow them to take control of the game. our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game   he said.  they have great quality in attack  they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.

sport,o driscoll saves irish blushes two moments of magic from brian o driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.  a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer s try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia  but denis hickie s try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes.  it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and  for the first quarter  the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.  when they finally did  just before the half-hour mark  o driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera  and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.  the only ireland player offering a real threat was o driscoll  and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over  with o gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter  but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.  an o gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o driscoll limped off late on  joining centre partner gordon d arcy on the sidelines  and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout.  de marigny; mi bergamasco  canale  masi  nitoglia; orquera  troncon; lo cicero  ongaro  castrogiovanni; dellape  bortolami; persico  ma bergamasco  parisse.  perugini  intoppa  del fava  dal maso  griffen  pozzebon  robertson.  murphy  horgan  o driscoll  d arcy  hickie  o gara  stringer  corrigan  byrne  hayes  o kelly  o connell  s easterby  leamy  foley.  sheahan  horan  o callaghan  miller  g easterby  humphreys  dempsey.  p o brien (new zealand)
sport,england s defensive crisis grows england s defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham s ledley king from the squad to face holland.  chelsea s john terry and wayne bridge are also out  leaving coach sven-goran eriksson with a real problem for wednesday s match at villa park. injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad  and matthew upson has already pulled out. wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. terry  the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title  would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand. but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher  alongside brown.  manchester united s brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february 2003. the 25-year-old was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson  who has a hamstring injury. and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england. king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england s medical staff. eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up  having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with a foot injury.

sport,hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory.  hodgson - now in charge at viking stavanger - was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee. hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe  although not in england - where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea  he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league.  i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge.  i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season  which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league.  the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage.  the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today  the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed  rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february.  hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages  explaining:  as i said  it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.   and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction.  in pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players  having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot  find themselves getting very jaded.  the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and  perhaps more importantly  recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.  the mental side is by far the most important thing.  hodgson added:  the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year.  it was so short you didn t do anything. you gave the players a week or 10 days off  then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game.  if it is longer  it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.  and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said:  if we talk about football at elite level  which the premiership is  then i would support a winter break.  if you examine the demands of the premier league and  in particular on players who play international football for their club and country  then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.
politics,falconer rebuts  charade  claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia  through the back door  were not a political ploy  the lord chancellor has said.  ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear.  the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment  including food and fluids.  tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland.  it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen   he said.  on tuesday  the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203  despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually  he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes  prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.  lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news:  we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.  the motive has got to be to end suffering.  he denied the concessions were a  political manoeuvre  forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a  sensible solution   he said.  i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with   he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was  waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast  after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an  excellent job . former conservative leader iain duncan smith  one of the chief critics of the plans  condemned the debate as a  charade  and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.
politics,brown  proud of economy record  gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour s spring conference setting out the government s agenda for the next general election.  the chancellor said he was proud of his party s record on the economy  and would strive for continuing stability if elected. the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. later  prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.  analysing mr brown s position before the speech  bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw  sharp dividing lines  with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. he would contrast labour s plan to invest £60bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by £35bn.  mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade   our correspondent said.  on friday night  mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget  expected in march. but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether  as the conservatives claim  he plans to raise tax after the election. the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.  following the chancellor s keynote speech  the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday. mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election. capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. the prime minister s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed  alan milburn  labour s election strategist told radio 4 s today programme on saturday. mr blair has  the same passion and the same commitments for the job  as when labour came to power in 1997  he said.  and he confirmed mr blair s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. he said:  i m the general election co-ordinator and i don t know  and tony has not made up his mind.  on friday  the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england  during which he unveiled his party s six pre-election pledges. starting in london  he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour s achievements on the economy  crime  education and public services. the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour s election campaign - were  worthless .

sport,celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play-off in three weeks  time.  but before that game in cardiff  wales must get past scotland at murrayfield  while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french. no-one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march - sublime  as in the first half against wales  or ridiculous  like in the same period against england at twickenham. but how the mighty have fallen. england sat on rugby s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners. but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney. and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play-off against italy in a fortnight.  england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987. coach andy robinson  who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september  has lost a phalanx of world cup stars. and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. the same year that england ruled the roost  a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations. and they won only two games  against scotland and italy  in 2004. wales  most recent championship title was in 1994  and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards  phil bennett  jpr williams et al.  but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. after several false dawns  coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas  now out with a broken thumb  accurate kicking from either fly-half stephen jones or centre gavin henson  a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front  and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams. ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too  and they are close to shedding the  nearly-men  tag that has dogged them for the past few years. the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners-up for the past two years  to france and england.  but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948. as for scotland  they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon  winners  have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win  and can still only account for the scalps of scotland (twice) and wales since joining the elite in 2000. coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri  but is lacking in raw materials. and so to france. brilliant one minute  inept the next. but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. ireland  though  have won three times in their last five meetings. welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam. but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings  the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march.
politics,mps assess scots fishing industry a group of mps are on a two-day fact-finding mission to scotland to gather evidence for a report into the uk s fishing industry.  members of westminster s environment  food and rural affairs committee will be touring fish markets and talking to fish processors. they will also talk to fisheries minister ross finnie and scientists. mps are deciding whether to recommend a new system of  community quotas  to conserve fish stocks. the aim is that fishing ports like peterhead or fraserburgh would be allocated a quota and local people would decide how to fish it. the scheme is a variation on the local management committees already being established by the european union.  details are contained in a royal commission report for the uk government  along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely. six members of the committee will be in scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in aberdeen and peterhead. they will also speak to mr finnie  representatives of the royal society and the sea fish industry authority. committee chairman austin mitchell said some way has to be found of harvesting mixed fisheries without wasting stocks.
politics,protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain s airports have begun challenging the government s plans in the high court.  baa s expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport  or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins  the government s future aviation plans outlined in last year s transport white paper could be left in ruins.  the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports  such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield  leader of essex county council  told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry.  we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation  consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper.  then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.  he added:  politicians should not decide where runways should be.  the stansted expansion  apart from the building of the new runway  would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.  the airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.
politics,howard taunts blair over splits tony blair s feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed  tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime minister s questions.  mr howard asked:  how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other   that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters. but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people s priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour.  he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages  low inflation  low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to   he said. the chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. but before doing so  he insisted he still trusted mr blair  despite claims to the contrary in a new book.  brown s britain  by robert peston  says there is mutual animosity between the two men. it claims mr blair said in november 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election. but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him  it says.  mr peston s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair:  there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe.  mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday. he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit.  the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor. he declared:  he is the deals on meals prime minister. no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater.  he continued:  how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government  how can they clean up our hospitals when they don t clean up their act   mr blair said he would not respond to  tittle tattle in books  and promised to hail labour s record on the economy  waiting lists and law and order  from now until polling day . later at their poster launch tory co-chairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how  juvenile  the prime minister and chancellor were.  labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday  where mr brown was joined by alan milburn  who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news:  the government is clearly split at the top. this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody.  later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his party s next election manifesto. the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston s book.
sport,strachan turns down pompey former southampton manager gordon strachan has rejected the chance to become portsmouth s new boss.  the scot was pompey chairman milan mandaric s first choice to replace harry redknapp  who left fratton park for rivals saints earlier in december.  i think it s a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the southampton manager   strachan told the bbc. club director terry brady held initial talks with strachan on saturday. the former scotland international added that joining southampton s local rivals would not be a wise move.  it s got everything going for it but i ve got too many memories of the other side and i don t want to sour those memories   he said.  everything s right - it s 10 minutes away  there are good players there  a good set-up  a good atmosphere at the ground.  there s lots to do but it s not right for somebody who has just been the southampton manager.  since redknapp s departure  executive director velimir zajec and coach joe jordan have overseen first-team affairs.  the duo had gone five matches unbeaten until sunday s 1-0 defeat at home to champions arsenal  but the club are still in a respectable 12th place in the premiership table. strachan left st mary s in february  after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season. his previous managerial experience came at coventry  whom he led for five years from 1996 to 2001.
sport,man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city.  wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot  which went in via a deflection off richard dunne  to put united ahead. seven minutes later  the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james  head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony  looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems.  wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips  sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break  united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first-half chance  rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne s leg. worse was to come for dunne  who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes  he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry. however  city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.  - manchester city boss kevin keegan:  we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.  we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much.  but we still had four good chances  two after we d gone 2-0 down  the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.    - manchester united boss sir alex ferguson:  it wasn t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners.  at times  especially in the first half  we didn t play with enough speed. but with (cristiano) ronaldo and (ryan) giggs on  the speed improved.  derby games can be like that  they can be scrappy  dull  horrible and it was maybe like that.  man city: james  mills (bradley wright-phillips 83)  dunne  distin  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  barton (macken 68)  sibierski  mcmanaman  musampa  fowler. subs not used: weaver  onuoha  flood. booked: fowler  sibierski. man utd: carroll  gary neville  ferdinand  brown  heinze  o shea (ronaldo 33)  keane  fortune  fletcher (giggs 64)  rooney  scholes (phil neville 84). subs not used: howard  bellion. booked: rooney  scholes  keane. goals: rooney 68  dunne 75 og. att: 47 111 ref: s bennett (kent).

sport,hearts of oak 3-2 cotonsport hearts of oak set up an all ghanaian confederation cup final with a 3-2 win over cameroon s cotonsport garoua in accra on sunday.  the win for hearts means they will play asante kotoko in the two-leg final  after the kumasi team qualified from group a on saturday. in the other group b game cameroon s  beat  of south africa 3-2 in douala  neither side could have qualified for the final. hearts of oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through. louis agyemang scored the first two goals for hearts either side of half time before ben don bortey scored the third. hearts looked set for a comfortable win but cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on. first of all boukar makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game andre nzame iii was on target. but it was too little too late for the cameroonians and hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final. the first leg of the final will be played in accra on the weekend of 27-28 november and the second leg two weeks later on the 11 december in kumasi. in the other group b game cameroon s sable batie took the lead in the 35th minute through kemadjou before santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to thokozani xaba . bernard ngom put sable ahead just five minutes later and then ernest nfor settled the game on 68 minutes. ruben cloete scored the south african sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock.
sport,healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations.  healey  who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup  has been in good form in the tigers  resurgence this season.  i definitely still have ambitions to play for england   healey told the bbc.  we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me.  healey  who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career  has reverted to the wing  where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september  the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival.  i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before   he said.   i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half  fly-half or full-back at a moment s notice.  but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things.  that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first  healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then  in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday  healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers  third try.  i caught  cozza s  eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full  but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score   healey recalled.  healey  twice a heineken cup winner  believes last sunday s match was  up there  with some of the biggest club contests he has played in.  it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game   he recalled.  there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in.  after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.   the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed  rugby s version of rocky ii .  there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done   he added.  it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result.  i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week.
politics,petrol duties frozen  brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday.  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial year  because of  volatility in the oil market   he said the duty would be frozen. during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. he said:  it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.  but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.   the rac welcomed the news  calling it an  early christmas present  for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists.  we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action   said a spokesman. in 2000 the people s fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year  but despite threats of more protests in 2003  he added 1.28p per litre.
politics,blair pledges unity to labour mps tony blair has sought to reassure labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the party s bid for a third term in power.  mr blair was speaking to mps amid fresh rumours of a rift with gordon brown. a new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to mr brown to stand down before the next general election. the chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo alan milburn for a labour poster launch this week. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party (plp) on monday:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. a new book  brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004.  it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election  widely expected to be held in may  and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting. health secretary john reid earlier warned that labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. he told bbc news:  those who co-operate or inspire these books  in my view  have to know that  whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure  they always do it by damaging the record  the unity and the re-election chances of the labour party and the government.  mr blair on sunday dismissed claims of broken promises  saying:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   in a separate bbc interview  mr brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by  gossip .  it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government   he said.  on monday  mr blair s spokesman said:  the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want.  mr brown says he discussed the election campaign with mr blair on saturday and promised to play his part.  mr peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt . mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war.  he had then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. mr brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything mr blair told him. conservative co-chairman liam fox likened the two men to  self-obsessed schoolboys . liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said their personal ambition was  getting in the way of good government . ex-labour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests. he told bbc radio five live that mr brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.
sport,ferguson hails man utd s resolve manchester united s alex ferguson has praised his players  gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at aston villa.   that was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football  end-to-end with lots of good passing   said the old trafford boss.  we showed lots of character and guts and we weren t going to lose.  i look at that fixture and think we ve been there and won  while arsenal and chelsea have yet to come and villa may have some players back when they do.  ferguson also hailed senior stars ryan giggs and roy keane  who came off the bench for the injured john o shea.  roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got.  giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration.  all we can do is maintain our form  play as we are and we ll get our rewards.
politics,parties  plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003  when the average english bill rose 12.9%.  pensioners  protests spread - some marched  others simply refused to pay the increase. some  such as 83-year-old elizabeth winkfield  said they would rather go to jail. the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was  fundamentally flawed  and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.  labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills  with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils  budgets to keep demands down. deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be  radical reform . the party says this year s increases will be the lowest in a decade. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation  such as reformed business rates  although no decisions have been made. an independent inquiry into its findings  the lyons review  is due to report back at the end of 2005.  the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners  who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. they say they can save £4bn on  government waste   of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners  bills by an average of £340. it would not be means tested  say the tories  because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill  up to a maximum of £500. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.  the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa  norway and switzerland. the rate would be set locally  but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least £300m. they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain  because it puts a  ceiling  on what the richest pay. the party says it would aim for a £5 000 tax-free personal allowance  or a £7 000 allowance for the over-65s. after that income would be taxed up to £100 000. the lib dems say their plan is fairer  more efficient  has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.
sport,nadal puts spain 2-0 up result: nadal 6-7 (6/8) 6-2 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 roddick  spain s rafael nadal beats andy roddick of the usa in the second singles match rubber of the 2004 davis cup final in seville. spain lead 1-0 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie.  nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 2-0 up in the tie.  roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now.  nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points. one is enough  the spaniard secures the double-break and roddick is now teetering on the edge.  roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired. nadal wins the game to love.  nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set.  nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set.  roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.  nadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. a couple of stunning points follow  one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.  nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. the set will go to another tiebreak.  nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.  roddick again holds on  despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.  nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick.  roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point.  nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set.  roddick s serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times  nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddick s grit pays off as he manages to hold.  roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point  which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold.  there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.  the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.  now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.  roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger.  roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.  nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.  two good serves put roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.  roddick s level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.  roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered  powering a passing winner past roddick.  nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.  nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.  nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.  roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddick s next set point.  nadal s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.  a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddick s slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point  nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.  nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadal s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.  the crowd are getting very involved  cheering between roddick s first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.  nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.  roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.  a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didn t know before  he knows now that he is in a real contest.  another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.  despite the disappointment of losing his serve  roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.  roddick s advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve  nadal pumps his fist in celebration.  the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal s serve from the start. nadal s drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break.  after moya s win in the opening rubber  a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadal s impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead. however roddick fights back to hold his serve.

politics,mcconnell details scots wave toll at least three people from scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list  the first minister has told msps.  the figures came out during a statement by jack mcconnell to the scottish parliament on wednesday. he formally expressed scotland s sympathy for the victims of the indian ocean tidal wave which killed 150 000. mr mcconnell went on to promise that scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort. he said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.  mr mcconnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. he said he was proud of the generous response of people in scotland to the disaster appeal  which is expected soon to top £20m. the first minister also praised scottish water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone. the scottish executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies.  but he said scotland was  in it for the long term  with help planned for fishing communities  for children s services  and for the aid charities. he said 2005 must be the year that scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world  whether in asia or in africa. mr mcconnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the make poverty history campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities  trade unions and churches in the run-up to the g8 summit in gleneagles in july. edinburgh architect  dominic stephenson  became the first scot to be confirmed as a victim of the asian tsunami. the 27-year-old was holidaying on the thai island of koh phi phi with eileen lee  24. she is still missing.
politics,uk rebate  unjustified  - chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uk s £3bn rebate from the european union  unjustified .  speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984. he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk.  mr chirac told reporters in brussels:  one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque. it can no longer be justified. it was from the past.  but a uk government official responded:  even with the rebate  the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget. without it we would pay 14 times as much as france.  there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.   the 25-member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013  with the bloc s luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit. earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a  crucial test  of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain. eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.  the uk  france  germany  austria  the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states  combined national incomes - the european commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. mr straw has said the eu commission s proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. shadow europe minister mr brady said:  i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it s a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe.   the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu .  the foreign secretary meanwhile said the  justice  of the rebate remained.  we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency.  that continues to be the case.   uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was  set in stone  and there was no reason to negotiate about it.  it is extraordinary to do it at this time  just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu. if we lose our rebate as well  the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project.  eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish european economy. uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution. the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. critics - including germany and france - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe  undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections. there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west  exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany.  mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate.  european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods   he said.  what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.  britain s low unemployment meant there was less  neurosis  about people coming from eastern european countries.  in countries like germany and france  where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment  there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in   he said.

politics,boateng to step down at election paul boateng  chief secretary to the treasury  is to step down as a labour mp at the forthcoming general election.  mr boateng  53  is to become the uk s high commissioner to south africa. he was the uk s first black cabinet minister when appointed to his post in 2002  promoted from the home office  where he had been prisons minister. mr boateng served on the greater london council before being elected to parliament in 1987  declaring  today brent south  tomorrow soweto . he will succeed the previous high commissioner  ann grant  shortly after the next election  which is widely expected to be held on 5 may. the appointment is dependent on labour s re-election.  prime minister tony blair said:  paul has been both a valued colleague and a trusted friend for many years.  he has made an immense contribution to public life in britain and i am delighted that he has agreed to continue that service to the people of britain by acting as their representative in south africa.  chancellor gordon brown said:  over the past eight years paul s contribution to the treasury and the government has been exceptional - and it has been my privilege to have worked closely with him closely at the treasury.  i congratulate paul on his new appointment.  he has displayed huge dedication to the cause of african development for many years and it is fitting that  in this year of challenge and opportunity for the african continent  paul has been given such a pivotal role in our fight against poverty and injustice.  i look forward to continuing to work with paul on this vital agenda.   mr boateng said:  i am honoured to be asked to take on this role  especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with south africa and the african continent.  there shall be many new challenges and opportunities ahead and i look forward to embracing them with great anticipation.  asked if he was appointed as the result of a  fair and open  competition  he replied:  i have been appointed as a result of a process that s been used before by labour and conservative governments to appoint people of all parties who have relevant experience.  mr boateng also laughed off suggestions that his re-election in brent south seat had been in danger saying it was  one of the safest labour seats in the country . shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said that  if in government  he would refuse to approve either mr boateng s appointment or that of ex-cabinet minister helen liddell as high commissioner to australia.  mr blair s appointment of paul boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed tony s cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts   he said.
sport,ref stands by scotland decisions the referee from saturday s france v scotland six nations match has defended the officials  handling of the game after criticism by matt williams.  the scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials. but nigel williams said:  i m satisfied the game was handled correctly.  meanwhile  matt williams will not be punished by the scottish rugby union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials. he denies having done so. nonetheless  he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side a famous victory. but nigel williams told the scottish daily mail:  i spoke to matt williams at the post-match dinner.  he made no mention of the disallowed try or any other refereeing decisions whatsoever.  if matt has issues with the match officials  then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them.  ultimately there is a match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials.  that is the beginning and end of it.
politics,kennedy to make temple address charles kennedy is set to address 2 000 people at a hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters.  the liberal democrat leader will visit the shri swaminarayan mandir temple in neasden  north west london. he will say labour  can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of britain s ethnic minorities . mr kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of  all races  over the iraq war and call for a  balanced approach  to tackling terrorism. saturday s speech comes days after the lib dems launched their ethnic minority mini-manifesto. mr kennedy is to tell the audience:  many people in britain  of all races  cultures and religions  were angry about the way we were taken to war in iraq.  and they saw the principled stand the liberal democrats took at the time.   he will also say that the lib dems want to  restore britain s reputation on the world stage  by fighting international poverty and climate change  and protecting human rights. mr kennedy will say that a  balanced approach  to tackling terrorism would mean  tough measures to make britain safe - but not at the expense of people s fundamental legal rights like has happened at belmarsh . he will say it also means acting through the united nations on terrorism. mr kennedy held talks with tony blair on friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest. he said afterwards that the prime minister had offered some  movement  to address his concerns. the plans face trouble in the lords if conservative and lib dem opposition continues.
politics,campbell: e-mail row  silly fuss  ex-no 10 media chief alastair campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at bbc journalists.  mr campbell sent the missive by mistake to bbc2 s newsnight after it sought to question his role in labour s controversial poster campaign. he later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a  silly fuss . mr campbell has recently re-joined labour s election campaign.  the e-mail was revealed the day after peter mandelson  former labour minister and now a european commissioner  warned the bbc to steer away from  demonising  mr campbell. mr campbell messaged newsnight after the programme investigated claims that labour s advertising agency tbwa was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. the images  including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted tory leader michael howard as fagin  prompted accusations of anti-semitism  claims denied by labour.  mr campbell s e-mail  which was apparently intended for a party official  suggested they should get trevor beattie  tbwa s boss  to issue a statement. in it  he said:  just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. now fuck off and cover something important you twats!  the e-mail was sent by mistake to newsnight journalist andrew mcfadyen. realising his error  mr campbell then e-mailed mr mcfadyen pointing out the mistake  but suggesting presenter jeremy paxman would have seen the funny side.  he said:  not very good at this e-mail blackberry malarkey. just looked at log of sent messages  have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at tbwa has gone to you. for the record  first three sentences of email spot on. no row between me and trevor.  posters done by them according to our brief. i dreamt up flying pigs. pigs not great but okay in the circs of tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. tbwa made production.  campbell swears shock. final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but i m sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter mr p.  never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. must look forward not back.   later the prime minister s spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on mr campbell s use of abusive language. the spokesman said:  the person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.  foreign secretary jack straw said he had always had  very good and polite relations  with mr campbell  who he described as  very talented . but on the former spin doctor s use of language  mr straw said:  i do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. maybe i mix with the wrong kind of journalists.  liam fox  tory co-chairman  said the return of mr campbell was a sign of new  sinister and underhand tactics  by labour.
politics,tory candidate quits over remark a conservative election challenger is quitting after being quoted as wanting a  period of creative destruction in the public services .  danny kruger  who also works in the tory research unit  had been due to take on tony blair in sedgefield. he says his remark last week was misrepresented but he will not contest the election for fear of damaging the conservative cause. tory leader michael howard accepted his decision  with regret . mr kruger was quoted in the guardian newspaper saying:  we plan to introduce a period of creative destruction in the public services.   in a statement  the party said the comment had been taken out of context.  he fully supports the party s policies on  and approach to  the public services   said the statement.  however  in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the party  he has decided not to stand in the sedgefield constituency at the next election.  mr kruger is continuing in his job at the tory campaign headquarters. labour election coordinator alan milburn claimed mr kruger had exposed the tory agenda for £35bn of cuts to public services. mr milburn said:  he is not some unknown hopeful fighting an unwinnable seat. he is a man who has worked at the heart of conservative policy development...  his claim that the tories were planning  a period of creative destruction in the public services  is not a rogue claim.  it is the authentic and shocking voice of the conservative party. it reveals the true picture of what they would do.
politics,errors  doomed first dome sale the initial attempt to sell the millennium dome failed due to a catalogue of errors  a report by the government s finance watchdog says.  the report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the millennium exhibition ended. the national audit office said the dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. finally  a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. more than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in greenwich  london.  the nao report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the dome. deputy prime minister john prescott said a good deal had been secured.  delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula   he said. but edward leigh  who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee  warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal. he said:  this report also shows that the first attempt to sell the dome proved a complete fiasco. every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. the process was confused and muddled.  he added:  four years after the millennium exhibition closed  the government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that  incredible as it may seem  should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. however  it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.  nao head sir john bourn said:  in difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition  english partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.

sport,all black magic: new zealand rugby playing colours:  all black  the haka and more!  the all blacks  charles john munro discovered rugby at london s christ college  and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand s first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may  1870  the town triumphing by two goals to nil  instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country s sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread  the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia  and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.  twenty-two maori and four  pakiha  formed the  new zealand native team   who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand  australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society  even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance  the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby  the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast  was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903  the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney  and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain  david revell bedell-sivright  created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington  sparking great celebrations across the country  but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.  their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking  inventive approach  but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a  roving  forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective  two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland  before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first  golden age   and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park  but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short  but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed:  i did score that try in cardiff.   four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed  all golds  rugby league side soon after the tour  but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series  starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks  inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as  the invincibles  after winning all 30 of their games in france  britain and ireland  including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success  the all blacks  2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times  and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand  rover  system for the first time  south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand)  the lions manager describing the tactic as  cheating   prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks  1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage  schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12  although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park  but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous  match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations  before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour  and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6-0  their first win at the arms park in four attempts  and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour  but when they returned home the first question put to them was:  what happened in newport   the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales  as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park  though  and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived  but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty  duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game  the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup  and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young  talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners  but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games  wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game  but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales  best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989  and at the 1995 world cup wales  big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997  and as wales  misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game  but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup  but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game  but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win  but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen  coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance  but clearly history is not on their side.

politics,lib dems   bold  election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an  honest choice  at the next general election.  with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes  mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two. with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government  he has switched tack. now he is promising to levy a  modest  increase of the same amount on earnings over £100 000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. they are to scrap student fees  finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. that last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others  pensioners in particular  will pay less.  labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.  inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings  while labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals  although there is little chance they will propose increases. in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. but  unlike the old tory-labour debate  he believes voters are ready to see  modest  tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.  similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration  with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not  foment an artificial debate  about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas. once again  with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration  mr kennedy is stressing the different  more liberal approach of his party. mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances  declaring the tories were not going to be  significant players  in the poll. he repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. mr kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a  massive vote of no confidence   in tony blair s government. that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful  even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election. it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.

sport,italy aim to rattle england italy coach john kirwan believes his side can upset england as the six nations wooden spoon battle hots up.  the two sides  both without a win  meet on 12 march at twickenham and kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of england s current slump.  we have to make sure the england and france games are tough for them.  england have not been having the best of championships. that is a big one for us and them and i am sure my players will rise to the occasion   he said. but kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to london. roland de marigny and luciano orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to scotland as chris paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. kirwan said:  the kicking was the decisive factor in scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time.  but i have a lot of confidence in my players and i am positive we can put everything together against england.  england  meanwhile  are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin. first mark cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half charlie hodgson s kick  and then kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if josh lewsey had touched down after being driven over ireland s line.  but centre jamie noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats.  we definitely improved against an in-form irish side   he said.  we went to dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete  and i think we showed that.  we have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the italy game. we are under no illusions that it is going to be easy  but we definitely need a win.  england have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats  including france in paris last season  and have lost four in a row under andy robinson. his predecessor  sir clive woodward  began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws.
politics,baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government s aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.  the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents  groups and local councils to the government s white paper. the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow  stansted and luton airports. baa  which operates all three  said it was consulting with local communities.  we are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations   a baa spokesman said.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. the company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. among other measures  baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted  and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.  at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. stop stansted expansion said the white paper  published in december 2003  was  fundamentally flawed  and did not follow the proper consultation process.  we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper   said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said. hacan chairman john stewart said:  almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation white paper with much fanfare.  it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation.  yet  a year later the protesters are still here  and stronger than ever.   a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february.

politics,lib dems  to target stamp duty  the liberal democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election  in a bid to court first-time house buyers.  vince cable  the party s treasury spokesman  said raising the threshold to £150 000 would prevent over 400 000 home-buyers from paying the tax. he said first-time buyers were being  squeezed out  of the housing market. the labour party said the liberal democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. the plan forms part of a wider lib dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.  under the proposals  the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1 000  according to mr cable.  first time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net   he said.  by failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold gordon brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest.  by pledging to increase the threshold to £150 000  the liberal democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax.  paul boateng mp  labour s chief secretary to the treasury  said:  the lib dems  sums don t add up.  they can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments.  mr cable will publish his  alternative budget  on monday.
politics,msps hear renewed climate warning climate change could be completely out of control within several decades  the scottish environment protection agency is warning a committee of msps.  experts are giving evidence on the subject to the scottish parliament s environment committee. officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal uk air travel and boosting electric trains. the evidence is part of the committee s inquiry into the impact of climate change in scotland. sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases  as pollution from transport emissions increases.  ecologists are warning msps that scotland may have to accept  significant intrusion  from wind farms. it is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. experts studying the seas off scotland s west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month.  they predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. researchers from the university of the highlands and islands and southampton have been looking at wave heights in the atlantic over the last nine years. the project was conducted jointly by the environmental research institute in thurso  which is part of the university of the highlands and islands (uhi) millennium institute network  and the southampton oceanography centre. scientists carried out a series of studies  including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the hebrides.
sport,robinson out of six nations england captain jason robinson will miss the rest of the six nations because of injury.  robinson  stand-in captain in the absence of jonny wilkinson  had been due to lead england in their final two games against italy and scotland. but the sale full-back pulled out of the squad on wednesday because of a torn ligament in his right thumb. the 30-year-old will undergo an operation on friday but england have yet to name a replacement skipper.  robinson said:  this is very disappointing for me as this means i miss england s last two games in the six nations at twickenham and two games for my club  sale sharks.  but i m looking to be back playing very early in april.   robinson picked up the injury in the 19-13 defeat to ireland at lansdowne road on saturday. and coach andy robinson said:  i am hugely disappointed for jason.  as england captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the six nations  leading by example at all times. i look forward to having him back in the england squad.  the announcement is the latest setback for robinson s injury-depleted squad.  among the key figures already missing are jonny wilkinson  mike tindall  will greenwood  julian white and phil vickery - a list which leaves robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role. former england skipper jeremy guscott told bbc radio five live his choice would be matt dawson  even though he is does not hold a regular starting place.   the obvious choice is dawson  said guscott.  especially given that harry ellis did not have his best game at scrum-half on saturday.  dawson has the credentials and the experience  even though his winning record at captain is not great.  the other option in martin corry  who is the standout forward at the moment.  unfortunately england cannot rely on leaders on the field at the moment.  england will announce their squad for the 12 march game against italy on saturday.
sport,moya fights back for indian title carlos moya became the first man to successfully defend the chennai open title by beating four-times finalist paradorn srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).  the spaniard then donated his £28 000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the asian tsunami. the final was close throughout  with thai second seed srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. but moya took the second set  before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. moya confirmed afterwards:  i m donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims  hoping it makes some difference to their lives. his contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament  which went ahead after the 26 december disaster which has so far claimed at least 150 000 lives. scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in thailand  where more than 5 000 people were killed. the atp has announced that it would contribute the us$25 000 tournament fee to unicef s emergency relief fund in tamil nadu. the atp tour s sponsor  mercedes  said it would also contribute  increasing the atp donation to us$40 000.
sport,bridge could miss rest of season chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.  the england international  24  was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners  fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday.  we think it s a big injury   said jose mourinho  whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea s 1-0 defeat at st james  park.  with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes  those knocks plus carlo cudicini s red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona  but had been promised a game in the carling cup final  although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona  even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back.  celestine babayaro left the club in january  ironically to join newcastle  and although gallas has deputised at left-back before  he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira  usually a right-back  is switched to left-back with glen johnson  who ended the newcastle game in goal  playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell  joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement  but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridge s injury also means mourinho  who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal  will not have a specialist  senior left-back for the run-in to the season.   he (bridge) has no chance of playing against barcelona  probably will not play against liverpool (in the carling cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season   he said.  the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see  but i won t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday.  shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge s injury.  i don t know what happened.  he said.  it was just a shame. i don t think we even touched each other.  by all accounts it s pretty serious. i went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.  mourinho  whose team are chasing three trophies  has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury.
politics,mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.  the cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. the group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. tony blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour s manifesto.  but the all-party group  including tories ken clarke and sir george young  labour s robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler  is confident its plan would win support from a  large majority . and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans. the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largely-elected second chamber. their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament  and its members would be known as mscps.  there would be 385 mscps  including 270 elected members  87 appointed members and 16 bishops. they would serve for between 12 and 14 years. mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. he added:  over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice.  what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament    the group believes pressure is growing for change and the government s current position is unsustainable. it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a  largely democratic  second chamber in their manifestos. mr clarke said the issue  went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system . and mr tyler said the prime minister s view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed.  the problem  i think  in the prime minister s mind is there doesn t appear to be a consensus that includes him   he said.  we are providing a consensus . the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.  we believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny   said co-ordinator peter facey.  in lieu of any other such clear proposals  the government must permit that to happen.
sport,bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester city s paul bosvelt will find out  within a month  whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal.  the 34-year-old dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and  although his age may count against him  he feels he can play on for another season.  i told the club i would like to stay for one more year. they promised me an answer within the next month so i am waiting to see   he said.  the main concern is my age but i think i have proved i am fit enough. bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england. but his professionalism and dedication impressed manager kevin keegan.  he realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. he is an unsung hero   said keegan.

politics,tories  would cut number of mps  the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected  tory leader michael howard has said.  the plan forms part of the party s  smaller government bill   to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly.  the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election  mr howard told the paper.  the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum  but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than 80 000 and the tories by almost 100 000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.  it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced  but what about ministers  parliament and special advisers   he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said:  this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people s lives by reducing the size and role of the state .  mr howard said the plan would also even out the  great unfairness  of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70 000 people  mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66 000  in wales just over 59 000 and in scotland 53 000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was  consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom  if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.  you have got to have a big bang. we don t want this like the house of lords reform  getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.
politics,blair defends terror law changes the prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial  saying  several hundred  people in the uk are plotting terror attacks.  the government is facing opposition from tory and lib dem mps and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final commons debate on the changes. but tony blair said there could be no concession on the  basic principle . mr blair told the bbc the  control orders  would only be used in the most limited circumstances. critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. but the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders  instead saying judges will be able to quash them.  an explanation is being sent by home secretary charles clarke to all mps and peers ahead of the final debate in the house of commons. on sunday  conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. some 32 labour mps voted against the legislation last week. barbara follett  whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era  confirmed she would vote against the government.  but the government is continuing to insist that  control orders  must be issued by the home secretary. mr blair told bbc radio 4 s woman s hour:  we are being advised by the police and the security services...  what they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able  being sure enough of the proof  to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt.  and these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.   a yougov poll in the daily telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in  rushing  anti-terrorism legislation.  i very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this.  he said after meeting tony blair he had been left with the impression that  he really wasn t interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward . mr clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords  where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. shami chakrabarti  director of civil liberties pressure group liberty  said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. she said the legislation was  a travesty and a perversion of justice  and would remain  unpalatable  even if a judge was involved early in the process.
sport,bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter.  with both sides looking for their first win of the championship  the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs.  it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win   said the lock forward. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000  but two of those have come against scotland. this year  italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17.  however  they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out. now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations.  scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh   said bortolami.  we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs.  as a nation  our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.
sport,england given tough sevens draw england will have to negotiate their way through a tough draw if they are to win the rugby world cup sevens in hong kong next month.  the second seeds have been drawn against samoa  france  italy  georgia and chinese taipei. the top two sides in each pool qualify but england could face 2001 winners new zealand in the quarter-finals if they stumble against samoa. scotland and ireland are in pool a together with the all blacks. england won the first event of the international rugby board world sevens series in dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory.  however  they beat samoa in the recent los angeles sevens before losing to argentina in the semi-finals.  england have the ability and determination to win this world cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the 15s and sevens world cups at the same time   said england sevens coach mike friday.  england have a fantastic record in hong kong and have won there the last three years  but the world cup is on a different level.  every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group.  we have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the irb sevens which has been disappointing - but we can only look forward.  england won the first rugby world cup sevens in 1993 with a side that included the likes of lawrence dallaglio and matt dawson. in 1997 and 2001  england lost in the quarter-finals.

politics,uk s  useless  quangos under fire the uk has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers  cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other s efforts  a report claims.  essential guide to british quangos 2005 author dan lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since labour won power in 1997. he urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. tories and lib dems welcomed the report and called for a  slimming down .  conservative deregulation spokesman john redwood said:  the research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos  and slimming down the rest.   a conservative government will axe 162 quangos  as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government.  lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhile said instead of the  bonfire of quangos  new labour had promised  there had been an  explosion  of them.  for over two decades  under both tory and labour governments  these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed.  liberal democrats would abolish many  merge others  and make any that remain properly accountable.  labour representatives were unavailable for comment. the quango guide follows last year s government-commissioned gershon report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.  mr lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £1.8bn a year - cash he says which  appears to be almost entirely wasted . as well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. he also listed what he dubbed the nine  most useless quangos . they were the british potato council  the milk development council  the energy savings trust  agricultural wages committees  the wine standards board  the westminster foundation for democracy  the football licensing authority  investors in people uk and the economic and social research council. mr lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee potato council  set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets   surprising . he said the £80m spent annually on the energy savings trust  which promotes renewable energy  would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for british homes.  and he argued it was  absurd  to charge farmers for agricultural wages committees  which set working and wage standards in the industry  when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour.  if a football team can afford to pay £27m for wayne rooney  why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the football licensing authority to the tune of over £1.1m a year   mr lewis asked. the report is published by the efficiency in government unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the economic research council and the centre for policy studies. it says before a new public body is set up  an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.
sport,henman overcomes rival rusedski tim henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday.  world number 46 rusedski broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set. rusedski had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after henman double-faulted  but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set. the british number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over rusedski. serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set  when rusedski s wild volley gave henman a vital break. a furious rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire.  henman  seeded three  then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve-and-volley winners to take a clear 5-3 lead. rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years. it was the first match between the pair for three years - henman last lost to rusedski six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes. the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals - rather than as team-mates - after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on 4-6 march. henman  who now faces russian igor andreev in the last 16  admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface.  you just take it point by point when you re fighting to stay in the match   he said.  i had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance.  i now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn t recover as quick as it used to  especially after two hours and 40 minutes.
sport,llewellyn plans wales retirement wales record cap holder gareth llewellyn will retire from test rugby at the end of the six nations.  the veteran lock  who is 36 at the end of february  told bbc wales scrum v that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap wales career. llewellyn is on a one-season deal with french club side narbonne  but said he may consider retiring from all rugby.  i don t know what i ll do next year  whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career   llewellyn said.  narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year  so i ve got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else  but ultimitely coaching is where i d like to end up.  i ve done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect  so it s just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.  fellow locks robert sidoli and brent cockbain  who both scored tries in saturday s six nations win in italy  are wales coach mike ruddock s preferred starters in the second row.  with the resurgence of the dragons  ian gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker jon thomas on the bench  llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this six nations campaign. but the former neath and ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt.  if i do get on the field then brilliant  although the boys are doing really well and i m very pleased for them   llewellyn added.  we ve had some really tough years in wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot.  sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away  but a few of us dug in there and it s really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now.  i was going to retire at the end of the last six nations  i d even told some of the boys in the squad about it.  but mike (ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season  which i ve done  still part of the squad  still trying to help them out as much as i can.  llewellyn made his wales debut in 1989 against new zealand as a 20-year-old  having caught the selectors  eyes in the all blacks  tour match against neath. the 6ft 6in player has not looked back since  going on to break neil jenkins  wales cap record on 12 june 2004 in the 50-44 loss in argentina.   there s been lots of highs - winning the six nations in  94  beating england in  93  i ve been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries   llewellyn said.  but i think the best thing of all for me was the time i spent with the players  i ve met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends.  it ll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch wales play  but at least i might have time to get my golf handicap down!  llewellyn captained neath for seven seasons  while being an integral part of the neath-swansea ospreys regional side s first season. but with the ospreys building for the future  llewellyn was eventually forced to look to france for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for wales.
politics,councils  must find gypsy sites  ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers  amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.  councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks  said housing minister yvette cooper. in november  mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 500 travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out £25m in four years  with £8m available for 2005.   there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites   said ms cooper.  firstly  local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly  they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites.  the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites  causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers.  that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites  as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment.  under the new regulations  expected to be in force in the spring  officials will be able to serve  temporary stop notices  aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. many mps with rural constituencies  particularly in eastern england  have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers  saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.  andrew ryder  of the traveller law reform coalition  said:  we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers  so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored.  new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers  as they often do.  living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals  legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun.  in their november report  mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister  responsible for housing  said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities  said the mps. in turn  the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. two of the most controversial traveller sites - cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.
sport,davenport hits out at wimbledon world number one lindsay davenport has criticised wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.  reacting to a disputed comment by all england club chairman tim phillips  the american said:  i think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away.  somebody  i think it was mr phillips  said they won t have money for flowers at wimbledon. that s insulting.  an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark  insisting:  he definitely didn t say it.  the statement added:  it was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds.   davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week s dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women.  you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five   said daveport.  and the best women are never going to beat the best men.  but it s a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn t make it better or worse.  hopefully we will be able to change people s minds.   serena williams  who is also in dubai  added:  i m obviously for equal prize money.  women s tennis is exciting. men s tennis is exciting as well  but the women have it right now.  if you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.
sport,dundee utd 4-1 aberdeen dundee united eased into the semi-final of the scottish cup with an emphatic win over aberdeen.  alan archibald prodded united ahead in 19 minutes and james grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. richie byrne s header gave aberdeen a way back into the game  but stevie crawford restored united s lead from 18 yards before half time. the scoring was completed by grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. tony bullock in the united goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. noel whelan laid the ball off to jamie winter on the edge of the box  but his first-time effort was gathered by the united keeper. moments later though  the home side took the lead. barry robson whipped in a free kick from the right  which stevie crawford caught on the volley. russell anderson failed to deal with it and whelan s clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of archibald  who poked the ball into the net. united doubled their lead after 29 minutes when grady tapped the ball into an empty net after robson had headed mark wilson s cross off the angle of post and bar. but only three minutes later aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. a free kick from the left by winter was met powerfully by the head of byrne at the back post  leaving bullock helpless.  united restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. jason scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing crawford and he coolly beat ryan esson from 18 yards. united ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. grady received a pass from crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch  he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of esson. the home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from esson to keep out robson s drive after 62 minutes. the keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later  beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area. robson saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line.  bullock  duff  wilson  ritchie  archibald  scotland (samuel 63)  brebner  kerr (cameron 87)  robson  crawford  grady.  colgan  dodds  kenneth.  brebner.  archibald 19  grady 29  crawford 41  grady 47.  esson  hart  anderson  diamond  byrne (morrison 75)  mcnaughton  heikkinen (foster 27)  winter  clark (stewart 51)  mackie  whelan.  blanchard  mcguire.  : anderson  diamond.  byrne 33.  8 661  k clark
sport,greek pair set for hearing kostas kenteris and katerina thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the iaaf at an independent tribunal this weekend.  athletics  ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. an independent tribunal of the greek track and field federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. the sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport:  we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical.  there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials  and these procedural breaches have also violated my client s rights.  there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.  ioannidis  who is a law lecturer at the university of buckingham  added:  one of the important rights and foundations of law and justice - that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise - has been tarnished.  the panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes  controversial coach christos tzekos by the iaaf. kenteris  the 2000 olympic 200m champion  and thanou  the women s 100m silver medallist from the same games in sydney  quit the olympics on 18 august after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.  testers could not find them at the olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. they also missed tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens before the games. in imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 december  the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as  unacceptable . whatever the findings of the independent tribunal  all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. the tribunal hearing will take place at the hellenic olympic committee building. it will start at 1200 gmt on saturday and is expected to finish early next week. the tribunal panel will consist of five members - president konstantinos panagopoulos and panagiotis dimakos  haralabos hrisanthakis  stilianos perakis and ioannis karmis. kenteris and thanou also face criminal charges in greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as tzekos  an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials. but there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped.
sport,candela completes bolton switch bolton boss sam allardyce has signed roma defender vincent candela on a five-month deal.  the 31-year-old former france international gave his last press conference as a roma player on monday  anouncing his move to bolton.  i have signed a five-month contract with bolton   said candela  who will travel to england on tuesday.  in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football.  allardyce hopes candela s arrival will relieve bolton s injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldham s 1-0 win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday.  in light of what has happened to nicky hunt  with his injury  it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back   allardyce said.  he has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the world cup in 1998.  he has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the premiership.  he can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right-footed he has played the majority of his career at left-back.  candela  who was a member of the roma side that won the title in 2001  has made only seven league appearances this season for luigi del neri s side.
sport,big guns ease through in san jose top-seeded americans andy roddick and andre agassi survived minor scares to reach the last eight of the sap open.  agassi endured early problems against left-handed dane kenneth carlsen before sealing a 7-5 6-1 victory. and world number three roddick dropped a set to korean player hyung-taik lee  before pulling out a 6-3 3-6 6-2 win in san jose  california. seventh seed jurgen melzer came through 6-3 6-3 against xavier malisse - winner in delray beach last week. frenchman cyril saulnier  meanwhile  fired 19 aces to secure a 6-1 7-6 win over czech qualifier tomas zib.  roddick broke a racket in frustration in the third game of the second set. and afterwards was unimpressed with his form.  i m not playing great   he said.  but i m through and i m going to keep battling.  a lot of people are under the assumption that it s easy to play well every week and it s not.  it is the 12th time in 13 appearances at the event that agassi  now 34  has progressed to the quarter-final stage. he came from 0-40 down in the opening game to hold serve and gradually wore carlsen down after attacking his backhand. agassi also employed several lobs and charged to the net to unsettle the 31-year-old dane  ranked 88th in the world.  as the match went on  i got real patient and waited for my opportunities and felt pretty good   said agassi.
sport,minister digs in over doping row the belgian sports minister at the centre of the svetlana kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her.  claude eerdekens claims the us open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month. criticised for making the announcement  he said:  i will never apologise. this product is banned and it s up to her to explain why it s there.  kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took. the russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event. the women s tennis association cleared kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition.  eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament  belgian justine henin-hardenne  nathalie dechy of france and russia s elena dementieva. but dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row.  how can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping   dechy said.  i m really upset about it and i think the belgian government did a really bad job about this.  i think we deserve an apology from the guy. you cannot say anything like this - you cannot say some stuff like this  saying it s one of these girls. this is terrible.  dementieva is also angry and says that dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal.  you have no idea what i have been through all these days. it s been too hard on me   she said.  the wta are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims  but i see only two victims in this story - me and nathalie dechy  who really have nothing to do with this.  to be honest with you  i don t feel like i want to talk to sveta at all. i m just very upset with the way everything has happened.
politics,regiments  group in poll move a regiments  campaign group is to target nine marginal labour seats at the general election.  save the scottish regiments will also field a candidate against armed forces minister adam ingram in east kilbride. the group  which is unhappy at defence merger plans  is endorsing opposition candidates in nine seats. the marginals are aberdeen south  dumfriesshire  dundee east and west  south west edinburgh  ochil  stirling  east renfrewshire and western isles. the campaigners unveiled a huge poster featuring black watch soldiers fighting the war in iraq before they announced their election plans.  former scots guardsman allan hendry will challenge mr ingram. the group said it is well organised  with 350 volunteers  and will be announcing at least one other candidate later. it added that it can only be stopped from inflicting serious damage on labour if the government reverses its plan to merge the six scottish regiments.  scotland s only conservative mp peter duncan said the save the scottish regiments had done a  superb job  in fighting against defence cuts. he added:  their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops  and have shown a steely determination to make labour pay for their betrayal.  i have been honoured to speak at their rallies throughout scotland.  scottish national party leader alex salmond said it had received a  big boost  from the campaign s decision to endorse snp candidates in four marginal seats.   labour s arrogance has been their undoing. in trying to get rid of scotland s historic regiments  labour mps will end up being scrapped themselves   he said. however  labour mp george foulkes said the campaigners would not make any difference to the outcome of the election and would not win the argument.  a serving soldier knows that what labour is proposing is right   he said. as well as their election move  save the scottish regiments will join other campaigners at a rally in london in the spring. defence secretary geoff hoon announced last year that scotland s regiments would be combined into a single unit. the move was part of overall army reforms.
politics,labour seeks to quell feud talk labour s leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift.  mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn  the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair. a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.  the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr brown s traditional poll planning role. but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister  mr brown replied:  you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy.   he refused to comment on the new book  saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. mr brown later told reporters:  of course i trust the prime minister.  downing street cited that comment when reporters  suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair:  there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe . labour s new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s  lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards. mr milburn promised a poll campaign  which is upbeat  confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country .  conservative co-chairman liam fox derided the photo call  saying:  the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h.  labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the english-speaking world  he said.  the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston s new book. mr blair told mps and peers:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  labour s paul flynn said the pair had had a  scorching  from mps.  on tuesday  deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news:  they told us very clearly  it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.  the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. mr blair then changed his mind in june 2004  after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him  writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.  of course as a waiter for 10 years i have a professional ability here   he joked.

sport,wales stars need a rest - ruddock wales coach mike ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend s regional celtic league fixtures.  ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest  and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress.  we ve got the wru charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens   ruddock told bbc wales sport.  once we re in the six nations  the players will only be released in his and the wru s best interests.  the ospreys and scarlets say they are happy to support the wales cause  but the dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in friday s game with ulster. ceri sweeney  gareth cooper  ian gough and kevin morgan have been used sparingly by ruddock in the opening two six nations wins and captain jason forster believes they would benefit from a game with the dragons.   i m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time   forster told bbc wales sport.  it would also be a timely reminder to mike [ruddock] as to what they can do.  and the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch.  ruddock  though  is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue.  at this stage  there s nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further.  we ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region.  for example  the dragons might use james ireland this weekend. i ve been looking at the lad - he s a great prospect for the future.  french and english clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means stephen jones  gareth thomas and mefin davies will play this weekend. the majority of ireland and scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.
politics,immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.  but no longer. both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns. they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues  with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes. that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue. but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or  alternatively  running scared of addressing the problem. but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies.  the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration  with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk. labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.  now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry  and to kick out more failed asylum seekers. that has been attacked by the tories as too little  too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk. the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe-wide policy on immigration.  but  while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue  there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before. former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a  bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers .   my concern is that  whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate  right-wing political parties  picking up on statements like `burden to britain  will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty . it is precisely that concern - and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda - that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue. the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.
politics,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth  with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf  the lord chief justice  had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example  if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible  by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation  he said.  but director of the victims of crime trust  norman brennan  accused lord woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be  political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc)  the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty  the maximum reduction would be one sixth  and should never exceed five years  it said.  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said:  i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines.  i am confident  as a result  that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending.  director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald qc  who sits on the sgc  said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.  what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.  it represents a tougher regime than existed previously  because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity   he said.
sport,england claim dubai sevens glory england beat fiji 26-21 in a dramatic final in dubai to win the first irb sevens event of the season.  having beaten australia and south africa to reach the final  england fell behind to an early try against fiji. they then took charge with scores from pat sanderson  kai horstman  mathew tait and rob thirlby  but fiji rallied to force a tense finale. scotland were beaten 33-15 by samoa in the plate semi-final and ireland lost 17-5 to tunisia in the shield final. mike friday s england side matched their opponents for pace  power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time. but neumi nanuku and marika vakacegu touched down for fiji  only for a needless trip by tuidriva bainivalu on geoff appleford to allow england to run down the clock.  to be honest  england have wanted to win in dubai for a very long time now  and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long   said friday.   we didn t want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the england  15s  in a few years.  portugal confirmed their impressive progress in sevens rugby by recording a sudden-death win over france in the bowl final. samoa won the plate title by edging out argentina 21-19.
sport,roddick to face saulnier in final andy roddick will play cyril saulnier in the final of the sap open in san jose on sunday.  the american top seed and defending champion overcame germany s tommy haas  the third seed  7-6 (7-3) 6-3.  i was feeling horrible earlier in the week   roddick said.  i thought tonight was a step in the right direction.  saulnier battled to a 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3 win over seventh seed jurgen melzer  who twisted his ankle early in the second set. roddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. but he broke straight back and then broke haas again to lead 4-2.  it s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don t do anything with them   admitted haas.  i rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.  saulnier will move into the world s top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final.  it s taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind   he revealed.  sometimes i didn t believe i could get to a final and now i am here. i ve stayed mentally strong.  i m on the way. i ll keep fighting and work a lot and i ll be up there.
politics,mps demand  budget leak  answers ministers have been asked to explain how budget details were printed in a london newspaper half an hour before gordon brown made his speech.  the tories said a large chunk of the budget appeared to have been leaked in what they describe as a  serious breach of treasury confidentiality . the lib dems called for commons leader peter hain to make a statement and said chancellors had resigned over leaks. they were told it would be brought to speaker michael martin s attention. in the commons  tory frontbencher andrew tyrie mp demanded an immediate ministerial statement about how measures had been  clearly  or at least apparently  leaked to the evening standard .  raising a point of order  he said it was  the latest in a long line of discourtesies to this house   as well as a breach of confidentiality. he said:  i can only hope it is unintentional. if it were planned it would be a very grave matter indeed. a previous labour chancellor resigned after he leaked the budget.  hugh dalton resigned after leaking details of his 1947 budget to journalist john carvel  who published them in a london newspaper  just minutes before they were announced to the house of commons. liberal democrat david laws said it was a  very serious matter  and said mr hain should make a statement on thursday. deputy speaker sylvia heal agreed it was  of concern  but said nothing could be done immediately but the issue would be brought to mr martin s attention.
sport,holmes back on form in birmingham double olympic champion kelly holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the 1 000m at the norwich union birmingham indoor grand prix.  the 34-year-old  running only her second competitive race of the season  shook off the rust to win in two minutes  35.39 seconds. but she is still undecided about competing in the european championships in madrid from 4-6 march.  i ll probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute   she said.  my training hasn t gone as well as expected but i ve got two weeks to decide.  i need to take my time and make sure i feel good about what i m doing.  i felt very good here but with the crowd behind you  you feel like you can do anything.  american  was the eventual winner of the men s 60m race which almost ended in farce. three athletes were disqualified for false starting  including britain s mark lewis-francis  who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly. world 100m champion kim collins clinched second spot ahead of world 60m record holder and scott s training partner maurice greene. jason gardener s unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his european title in madrid.  you can t win them all   said gardener afterwards.  and i was very disappointed as i know i m capable of doing better.  russian  was back on record-breaking form in the pole vault at the national indoor arena.  the olympic champion set a new world mark of 4.88m to break her own record - which she set just six days ago - and beat russian rival svetlana feofanova. it was isinbayeva s 11th world record - indoors or out - since july 2003.  i m so happy and i will do my best to break the 5m barrier soon   the 22-year-old told bbc sport. jamaica s  stormed to a personal best of 7.13 seconds to claim the women s 60m sprint. belgian kim gevaert  who will be one of the favourites for next month s european title  took second while american muna lee was third. there was disappointment for british pair jeanette kwakye and joice maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively.  jamaican  stretched her unbeaten record to 25 races as she effortlessly claimed the 200m. the olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of 22.38 seconds - the fastest time in the world this season.  fought off fellow briton tim abeyie to take the men s 200m in a personal best of 20.88.  continued her outstanding start to the season  beating a strong international field  which included two-time olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist melissa morrison  to claim the women s 60m hurdles. the 25-year-old briton clocked 7.98 seconds while pre-european championships favourite russian irina shevchenko finished down in sixth. ethiopia s  failed in her bid to smash compatriot berhane adere s world 3 000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. the olympic 5 000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third  finishing in eight minutes  33.05 seconds - the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. britain s jo pavey bravely decided to go with defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a season s best 8:41.43. kenyan  also missed out on the indoor 1500m world record  which hicham el guerrouj has held for the last eight years.  lagat settled for silver behind el guerrouj in athens and was almost four seconds short of the moroccan s world best  clocking 3:35.27 in birmingham. and  was still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year. the olympic 10 000m champion had comfortably led the men s two mile race after his younger brother tariku had set the pace. but fellow ethiopian  appeared ominously on bekele s shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in 8:14.28. jamaican  made the most of a blistering start to take the men s 400m title in 45.91 seconds. world indoor champion  alleyne francique  faded badly and finished in fourth while american duo jerry harris and james davis took second and third respectively. swede  showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from jade johnson with the very last jump of the competition. the olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached 6.66m to better johnson s mark of 6.52m - her second personal best inside a week.  i was quite surprised because i didn t think i d end up with second place   said johnson  who wore london s 2012 olympic bid slogan   back the bid   on her shorts.  but i m pleased and hopefully i ll get a bit better for the europeans. i really want to win a medal.   won the men s event with a season s best of 7.95m  taking the scalp of world indoor champion savante stringfellow of the usa.
politics,tories urge  change at the top  tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election  declaring britain needs  a change at the top .  the party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and labour. tory co-chairman liam fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising tony blair s record in government. labour s rule has been characterised by  lost trust and failure to deliver   he told the brighton conference. he also attacked the government s  failure  to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs  telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the  shambles  of immigration  put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools  he said. dr fox also underlined tory promises to cut tax by £4bn.  bbc political correspondent shaun ley says opinion polls suggest the tories still lag some way behind labour on the issues of health  education and the economy. conservative leader michael howard  who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday  will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening  after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill  which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.
politics,pakistani women  must not hide  hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of islam  president musharraf of pakistan has said during a visit to britain.  he was speaking to the bbc s newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the pakistani community in manchester.  my wife is travelling around. she is very religious but she is very moderate   said general musharraf. it comes after pakistan s high commissioner to britain said some pakistanis should integrate more. dr maleeha lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.  gen musharraf told the bbc:  some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong.  the pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe.  yes  absolutely. and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems  so therefore we can never address it in its totality   he said.  we are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic long-term context.   it is the political disputes and we need to resolve them  and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty. this combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism.  on monday the pakistani president met prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street  on his first official visit to london. he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon.  the mirror newspaper said on tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of gen musharraf s visit to britain. the paper said the document had been found in a london street by a member of the public. it said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels  call signs and codes. speaking in london on monday  gen musharraf said al-qaeda was  on the run  in pakistan.  but standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the  core of what creates terrorists  what creates an extremist  militant environment which then leads on to terrorism .  that is the resolution of political disputes.   mr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan  the wider war on terror  the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir.  we agreed that in afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there   said mr blair.  in respect of iraq  we agreed that whatever the issues of the past  the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.
politics,jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland s justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them  where it hurts most  by banning them from matches.  cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. however  the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters  representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.  they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs  church leaders  senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. speaking on bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme  ms jamieson described friday s meeting as  very productive  and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a  trigger  for tensions and violence. clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters  groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem.  ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. she said:  we can t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence.  that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that s the kind of thing supporters  groups are very clear they don t want to be part of either  and they will work with us to try and deal with that.   ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said:  the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them.  we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top  who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches  to be able to stop them attending the games.  that s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games   she said. praising celtic and rangers for their efforts  she said:  i don t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs.  both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce  for example  an educational pack for young people.
sport,wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career  and gavin henson is already a welsh legend.  a mesmeric display against england  topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty  has secured life membership of that particular club. at 23  henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. and if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team-mates  then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys. the  red dragonhood  subdued the  red rose army  in most areas of the field  but henson s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. he announced himself in the game s opening salvo with a  welcome to cardiff  greeting for mark cueto on the gain line. and his defence was a major feature of the match  his principal victim poor old  or rather young  mathew tait. the england centre will have spent his 19th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once  but twice  by henson s all-enveloping tackles.  the second time  after the interval  single-handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at a time when england were starting to show menace. showing awesome strength  henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air  a master predator toying with his helpless prey  savouring the kill. his kicking game also prospered  particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin-bin. one huge clearance from tait s kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch. he also had a hand in the game s only try  finished superbly by williams  and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space  only to be scragged by tait. henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din  and the outcome of the match fell to him. replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space  where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.  five metres in from the right touchline  44 metres out  it was not a kick stephen jones  who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar  would have approached with confidence.  it was out of steve s range but i looked at gavin  and he gave me a reassuring nod   said thomas. henson  surveying his date with destiny  positively relished the responsibility  and the chance to make himself a hero. without further ado  he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and 12 years of waiting in cardiff.  i knew i was going to get it before i even took the kick   he said later  his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape.  i have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn t a problem.  there were still four minutes for wales to hold out  and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. but it was wales who finished the game on the attack  almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.  just do it  implored the front page headline on saturday s western mail newspaper. and  thanks to henson  wales did.
sport,what now for kelly holmes  last april  kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness  her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics.  it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. four months later  holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame  won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. with so much time spent in the spotlight  holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead  the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the  don t know  box. holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships  where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m  because of a hamstring injury. but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore   well  it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion  being feted by everybody  than training to be at the top in middle distance running   points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram.  you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented.   holmes  drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself.  will i have as much commitment  desire and energy to go through a major championship   holmes asked in the new year.  that is what i don t know.  at 34  holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson  a five-time olympic gold medallist  retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes  who has already admitted she  doesn t like the training anymore.  whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race  she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer  there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens  the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.  holmes  wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled  such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes  motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains  nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand  if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn t they be at least shared and celebrated   you don t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion   agreed cram.  you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling.  i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.   athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so  why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where  when or whether to even bother competing again   that s just kelly   explains cram.  she s always been like that.  she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news.  kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions  whether she can be competitive  if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line.  and if she decides not to run again  no-one is going to turn round and say  you re making the wrong decision.
politics,cherie accused of attacking bush cherie blair has been accused of criticising george w bush s policies in a private address she gave during a united states lecture tour.  the prime minister s wife is said to have praised the supreme court for overruling the white house on the legal rights of guantanamo bay detainees. the tories said she broke a convention that british political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad. but downing street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer. it said she was not expressing political opinions. mrs blair s remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in massachusetts. she said the decision by the us supreme court to give legal protection to two britons held at guantanamo bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law. she also described the us legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by mr bush relating to sodomy in texas.  bbc news correspondent gary o donoghue said mrs blair was likely to face further calls for restraint  since the us election is imminent.  there have been some objections from people reasonably close to the bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election   he said.  conservatives here too have made their feelings clear.  cherie booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career. she has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts.  it s not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing.
sport,gb select holmes for double bid kelly holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month s european indoor championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.  the double-olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first european indoors in madrid. but uk athletics chief max jones believes it is likely holmes will race. he said:  it s worth a punt  isn t it  she s gone back to training. if she s confident she will pick one (distance). the programme does not permit both.  if holmes does take her place in the gb side  she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. under championship rules  she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in madrid on 4 march. jones added:  she was pleased with her run in birmingham (at last weekend s grand prix).  i am inclined to think she will (compete). it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form.  and he admitted holmes  presence would be a great boost to the rest of the norwich union gb team.  she is a very good team member and is very good to have there   he added. meanwhile  there is no surprises in the rest of the great britain team announced on tuesday.  defending 60m champion jason gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. he will be joined in the event by mark lewis-francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in vienna - and new boy darren chin. kelly sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against carolina kluft in the pentathlon. sotherton finished third in the olympic heptathlon in athens  where the swede took gold. there are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in gb s 46-strong team. the championships will be the last to be attended by jones before he retires to be succeeded by dave collins. jones said:  the olympic games is the overwhelming target for uka and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games.  the european indoor championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent.  madrid is the first small step on a long journey to beijing and the 2008 olympics but for some of the emerging athletes  this will be a very important step.   60m: d chin (belgrave harriers)  j gardener (wessex and bath)  m lewis-francis (birchfield harriers).  t abeyie (woodford green with essex ladies)  c lambert (belgrave harriers).  d garland (channel islands ac).  j mcilroy (windsor  slough  eton and hounslow ac)  jimmy watkins (cardiff aac).  ed jackson (aldershot  farnham and district)  n speaight (belgrave harriers)  j thie (cardiff aac).  a baddeley (harrow ac)  m farah (windsor  slough  eton and hounslow ac)  j mayock (barnsley ac).  d greaves (newham and essex beagles)  a scott (shaftesbury barnet harriers)  a turner (notts ac).  b challenger (belgrave harriers). pole vault: n buckfield (crawley ac).  n morgan (birchfield harriers)  c tomlinson (newham and essex beagles).  l achike (shaftesbury barnet harriers)  n douglas (oxford city ac)  p idowu (belgrave harriers).  d cossins (birchfield harriers)  r davenport (gloucester ac)  d garland (channel islands ac)  r preddy (gloucester ac)  g warburton (cardiff aac).  k endacott (city of plymouth ac)  j kwakye (woodford green with essex ladies)  j maduaka (woodford green with essex ladies).  k wall (basildon ac).  k holmes (ealing  southall and middlesex ac).  h clitheroe (preston harriers)  k holmes (ealing  southall and middlesex ac).  j pavey (exeter harriers).  d allahgreen (trafford ac)  s claxton (belgrave harriers).  j crane (sale harriers manchester)  s jones (trafford ac).  j whitlock (trafford ac).  j johnson (herne hill harriers).  k sotherton (birchfield harriers).  d fraser (croydon harriers)  l mcconnell (shaftesbury barnet harriers)  c murphy (woodford green with essex ladies)  m purkiss (southampton ac).
politics,labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which  for those just returned from the planet galifray  is  looming .  the slogan  britain forward not back  (no  it s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it s always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word  britain  is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour.  forward  is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and  along with  not back   is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared  it was all very post modern  or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and  coincidentally  the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called  fagin  posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but  as election supremo alan milburn declared   are doing a very good job .  mr milburn  in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning  explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards.  not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days   he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.  nobody  he claimed  could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could  however  picture michael howard or  of course  tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign  he said.  between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain  not overseas   he promised.  he will be leading the domestic debate from the front  listening  taking the flak.  so  let s get on with it then.
politics,parliament s record of scandal in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal.  sex  betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson.  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what s there online. until 1857  the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings  dating back to 1670  all recorded among the 325 000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament s victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance.  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids  butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell  the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband  edward addison  had committed adultery with her sister jessy.  a transcript of evidence from jessy s maid  amelia laugher  shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison s case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5 000 damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history  jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.  there are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the protestants who pledged to  maintain the true reformed protestant religion . there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament  including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which  for example authorise the building of railways and roads  contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself  listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office  with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior  assistant clerk of the archives  says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research.  before  you just could not do it  you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material   he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.  the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change  mainly motivated by the potential of it  which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us   he says.  the archives do  of course  hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament  including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834.  but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from 1689  the death warrant for charles i  the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the 1606 act establishing 5 november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes  conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat s skin):  all human life is here.
politics,jowell rejects  las vegas  jibe the secretary of state for culture  media and sport  tessa jowell  has hit out at critics of the gambling bill.  she told the guardian newspaper there would be no  las vegas-style  super-casinos  as rumoured in the press. meanwhile labour backbencher stephen pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes  a pile of pants . the mp for ealing north claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption  in an interview on bbc radio 4.  you look at some of the people who are involved...they aren t in there to regenerate blackpool. they are in it to fill their boots   mr pound told the today programme.  i just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. and over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti   he said.  ms jowell complained of the  scale of misrepresentation  in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper  her first since the bill was launched. the culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to  protect children and the vulnerable  in a swiftly changing sector. ms jowell insisted:  we have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country  for instance in social housing.  and continued:  we can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. i intend to keep it that way.  ms jowell will set out her position when the bill is debated in the commons on monday. in prime minister s questions last week tony blair assured parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.
politics,how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.
sport,moyes u-turn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas.  the scot initially defended beattie  whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0  saying gallas overreacted. but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. he said:  i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct.  moyes added:  my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one  very quick re-run of the incident.   the club website also reported that beattie  who seemed unrepentant after saturday s match  insisting gallas  would have stayed down a lot longer  if he had headbutted him  has now apologised. moyes continued:  although the incident was totally out of character - james has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates.  james did issue a formal apology to myself  his team-mates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline.  he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened. however  i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily.  speaking immediately after the game  moyes said:  i don t think it was a sending-off  i have been a centre-half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.   not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way. i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them.  what has happened to big  strong centre-halves  i thought it was a push initially and i still don t think it was a sending-off.  an angry beattie initially said:  he (gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him.  i can tell you it wasn t an intentional headbutt. we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off.  he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself  if you re going to stay in my way i ll go straight over you . our heads barely touched and it wasn t an intentional headbutt.
sport,safin cool on wimbledon newly-crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future.  after losing in round one last year  safin said he had  given up  on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind.  i ll play  but with no expectations. i feel like i can t waste my time  my energy on that surface   he said.  some people  they cannot play on clay. some people  they cannot play on a hard court. me  i can t play on grass.  however  safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles.  it s a relief for me. two grand slams  it s already something. but with this one i worked really hard for it   he said.  basically  i would love to win a couple more. i think i have a chance if i continue this way.   if (coach) peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer  i think i can make it.  the 25-year-old shocked pete sampras in the 2000 us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals. safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam.  i didn t expect that (to win the 2000 us open) - it was against sampras  i wasn t the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever   he said.  after the first final that i didn t win against thomas johansson (in 2002)  i couldn t see myself winning the grand slams anymore.  i was once in the semi-finals of the french open  but i didn t believe i can win it.  i just couldn t handle the pressure. you need to believe in yourself  and i didn t.   and after losing the first set 6-1 to lleyton hewitt in sunday s final  safin said he began to doubt himself again.  i am 25. i m playing against hewitt. at least you have to have the opportunity to win it  at least have a chance   he said.  it s like you go there and you lose first set 6-1  then you start to think:  this is not my day. the way i m playing is ridiculous.   but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there.  and i found it. i was like really much i was much happier than in 2000  that s for sure  because i get over it.
sport,moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville.  moya made up for missing spain s 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead.  i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day   said moya.  all my energy has been focused on today.  what i have lived today i do not think i will live again.  spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia  when they beat australia. and moya  nicknamed charly  admitted:  the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset.  some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way. it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed.  it s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.  spanish captain jordi arrese said:  charly played a great game. it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down.  he had lost three times to roddick  and this was his day to beat him.  he had been waiting years to be in this position.  spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal  who beat roddick in the opening singles.  aged 18 years and 185 days  the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup.  what a great way to finish the year   said nadal afterwards. us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface.  i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.   obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay  with the schedule.  but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff   said mcenroe. roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium.  it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world   said the american.  i had my chances and just didn t convert them. the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend.  they came out  took care of business and they beat us. it s as simple as that.
sport,edu describes tunnel fracas arsenal s edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester united s win over the gunners.  the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson.  i saw people being pulled apart  people pushing  pointing and shouting   he told uefa s official website.  the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but i didn t see any soup being thrown at anyone.  however  edu tried to play down the incidents  adding:  there was nothing that i haven t seen in brazilian derbies.  derby matches in brazil are worse. i like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry.  but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of united s challenges during the game  particularly on jose antonio reyes.  i think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than united   he said.  reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off.  following the game  the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel. it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee.
politics,pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk s biggest miscarriages of justice.  the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in 1974. mr blair said:  i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.  he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television  mr blair said the families deserved  to be completely and publicly exonerated .  the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister s questions in the house of commons. however  one of the so-called guildford four  gerry conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with  such sincerity   adding:  he went beyond what we thought he would  he took time to listen to everyone.  you could see he was moved by what people were saying.  tony blair has healed rifts  he is helping to heal wounds. it s a day i never thought would come.  the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would  ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister s statement brought to them .  most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon s father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london  as well as two family friends. she said it was a  wonderful feeling  to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.   the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent   she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives  based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october 1989 the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four  and in june 1991 it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon s case was highlighted in the oscar-nominated film in the name of the father  starring daniel day-lewis.
politics,thousands join strike in wales thousands of civil servants were on strike across wales on friday in protest at planned job cuts.  a range of services in wales were affected as civil servants in wales joined the uk-wide strike. the strike  called by the public and commercial services union  was the biggest by civil servants in a decade. the action follows chancellor gordon brown s announcement in july that 104 000 jobs would be cut  with around 6 000 of those expected in wales. the worst-affected area in wales will be the department of work and pensions where 2 000 jobs are threatened. across wales  pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including cardiff  bangor  aberystwyth and wrexham. gordon brown issued a defiant statement about the strike  saying the action would not affect the government s  determination  to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare  education  transport and the fight against crime.  our decisions mean more police  more teachers  more doctors and more nurses   he said.  we will provide help with information  relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector  but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment.  the uk-wide action hit jobcentres  benefit agencies  pensions offices and driving test centres. the strike also affected the welsh assembly building in cardiff bay  where only pass-holders were allowed in.  pickets were in place across wales  with protests around the country. pcs union spokesman jeff evans said:  in wales the civil service is major employer  there are more civil servants employed in wales proportionately than in any other part of the country.  our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country.  parts of objective one areas and welsh-speaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts.  the chancellor has said that the cuts will allow funding for more teachers and police. piers freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at companies house  in cardiff. he said:  the majority of people have decided not to come in because of the threat to their jobs.  i joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension  as we thought  and pay  and it s those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs.  people like pensioners need a face-to-face service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose.  pcsu deputy general secretary hugh lanning  who was on the same picket line  said:  we re asking for them to negotiate not just to make announcements.  there s a sensible way to do things and at the moment they re not even talking about how to go about it sensibly.   the ballot was for one day s action. no further action is anticipated without a further ballot of staff.  the welsh assembly government said:  this is a strike about national civil service issues. it is not about specific issues local to wales or the assembly.
sport,hewitt fights back to reach final lleyton hewitt kept his dream of an australian open title alive with a four-set win over andy roddick in friday s second semi-final.  the home favourite will face marat safin in sunday s final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied  thrilling the melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. he is aiming to be the first australian winner since mark edmondson in 1976. hewitt is the first australian to make the final since pat cash lost to mats wilander in 1988  but faces a huge challenge against safin - the conqueror of roger federer. after needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think hewitt might struggle for fitness. he certainly made a sluggish start  dropping his opening service game  and roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.  after 12 tense games in the second  the key moment came when hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. that energised the crowd but roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. again roddick broke first and again hewitt fought back  taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.  the australian was not to be denied and a disheartened roddick made little impact in the fourth set as hewitt raced to victory  sending the melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion.  it s awesome   said hewitt.  i started preparing for this tournament nine months ago.  i ve done a lot of hard yards to get here.  i ve always said i d do anything to get in the first night final at the australian open. now i ve got my chance.  roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks.  i m usually pretty money in those   said roddick.  either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage.  i m mad  i felt i was in there with a shot. he put himself in position to win big points. i donated a little more than i would have wanted.  and the american played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during rodick s service action.  it just took one jackass to shout out   said roddick  adding that the crowd overall was  very respectful .
sport,navratilova hits out at critics martina navratilova has defended her decision to prolong her tennis career at the age of 48.  navratilova  who made a comeback after retiring in 1994  will play doubles and mixed doubles events in 2005.  women s tennis is really strong   she said  dismissing suggestions that the fact she could still win reflected badly on the women s game.  all i can say is i m that damn good. i m sorry but i really have to blow my own horn here. i m still that good.  navratilova has won three grand slam mixed doubles titles since she came out of retirement. and she was so encouraged by her form that she decided to resume playing singles  winning two of her seven matches. she was knocked out in the first round of the french open but reached the second round at wimbledon. navratilova will partner nathalie dechy in the doubles event at the uncle toby s hardcourts tournament on australia s gold coast  which begins on sunday. she will then link up with daniela hantuchova for the australian open doubles  and play in the mixed doubles with leander paes.  i might be playing some singles events this season  depending on the surface   she added.
politics,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.  five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.  the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

sport,thomas out of six nations wales captain gareth thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the six nations with a broken thumb.  the full-back will have surgery on monday after fracturing his thumb in the 24-18 win over france on saturday. but welsh legend phil bennett insisted wales can cope without thomas as they chase a first grand slam in 27 years. bennett told bbc sport:  such is the spirit in the camp  they ll put kevin morgan at 15  rhys williams at wing and just carry on.  thomas will miss the match against scotland on 13 march  and what promises to be a huge encounter against the irish six days later. bennett added:  it s a setback. he s a great captain  he leads from the front and the boys love him.  thomas was replaced at half-time by williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in paris.   with gareth missing i would think michael owen will be our captain   said wales coach mike ruddock.  he did a great job in the second half in france. he has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship.  wales travel to edinburgh to take on scotland in a fortnight and then host ireland in cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the grand slam and championship decider. bennett  an inspirational fly-half for llanelli and wales in the 1970s  insisted the national team were entering a new golden period.  it was a great game and a magnificent result for wales   bennett told bbc radio five live s sportsweek programme.   the way this young team are blending  the glory days are on their way back.  we couldn t get possession early on and france dominated and scored two tries.  had they been ruthless  wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down. but they didn t take their chances.  wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides.  the all blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. but the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.
politics,voters  don t trust politicians  eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth  a new poll conducted for the bbc suggests.  and 87% of the 1 000 adults quizzed by icm for bbc news 24 said politicians did not deliver what they promised. the poll comes after foreign secretary jack straw predicted trust would be  the key choice  at the next election. both the tories and the lib dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in tony blair  following his claims over iraqi weapons.  but according to the bbc poll  61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election  widely expected on 5 may. the poll also looked at what lay behind the lack of trust in politicians. some 87% said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections  while 92% said they never gave  a straight answer . just under three-quarters of respondents (73%) said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often.  mr straw told activists in blackburn on thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party  best deserves  their  future trust .  that in the end is the key choice at the next election.   he acknowledged that the public had lost faith in labour  but suggested it could persuade people to  reinvest their trust with us  if the party could overcome tory attempts to spread cynicism in politics. the conservatives are keen to highlight the trust issue. during his response to gordon brown s budget statement on tuesday  michael howard compared the chancellor s figures to the prime minister s claims about iraq s weapons of mass destruction.  the lib dems are also keen to highlight the trust issue  with charles kennedy has claiming voters had a  fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister . and the green party unveiled a billboard opposite the palace of westminster accusing the government of lying over the iraq war.  former education secretary estelle morris told bbc news 24 that there was a  real problem of trust  between the public and the politicians. she said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted  but suggested the  three-cornered relationship  between the press  politicians and the public had a hand in the issue. the public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in  the battle of words  between the politician and the journalist  she added. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said the iraq war had hit trust in politicians hard.  issues of war and peace  life and death do have a very damaging effect on the credibility of politicians . martin bell  who won the tatton seat from tory neil hamilton on anti-corruption platform  said politicians often failed to see themselves as others did.  we need public figures we trust to tell the truth and who can see themselves as others see them.
politics,howard attacks cost of asylum michael howard has launched an attack on the cost of britain s  chaotic  asylum system under tony blair.  the tory leader said english local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since labour won power in 1997. mr howard is expected to tell activists in kent that voters  tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked tory plans for annual limits on numbers.  mr howard said britain should take its fair share of the world s  genuine refugees .   the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution   he was due to say.  but if we are to fulfil responsibility  we have to get a grip of the system.  fair play matters. people want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused   he said.  and let s be clear. our asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity.  earlier this week  mr howard said his party s plans to cut immigration were not racist  arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. if elected  his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.  that prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees  lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.  if we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution  then these policies will not provide a safe haven   said hannah ward of the refugee council.  if people turn up in the uk asking for help they will be turned away. michael howard s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the uk.  when it comes to costs  then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. so many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned  rising to half for some nationalities.  we need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.   tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans.  by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders  they will actually make the problem worse   said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick  fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was  absolutely disgusting  to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. on monday  mr howard said:  it s not racist  as some people to claim  to talk about controlling immigration far from it.
politics,hewitt decries  career sexism  plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour s election manifesto  the trade and industry secretary has said.  patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated  but it was an  increasingly high priority  and a  shared goal across government . ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission (eoc). mothers can currently take up to six months  paid leave - and six unpaid. ms hewitt told the seminar:  clearly  one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months.  we are looking at how quickly we can do that  because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.   ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors  saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and  taster courses  for men and women in non-traditional jobs. women in full-time work earn 19% less than men  according to the equal opportunities commission (eoc).  the minister told delegates that getting rid of  career sexism  was vital to closing the gender pay gap.   career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential.  it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex   she said. earlier  she told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women  so we have got very segregated employment.  unfortunately  in some cases  this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women  or indeed for men.  career sexism is about saying that engineering  for instance  where only 10% of employees are women  is really a male-dominated industry. construction is even worse.  but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. career sexism goes both ways.   she added that while progress had been made  there was still a gap in pay figures.  the average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. for women working part-time it is 60p.  the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc.  it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of  natural differences  between the sexes. women hold less than 10% of the top positions in ftse 100 companies  the police  the judiciary and trade unions  according to their figures. and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.

sport,robben and cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvaged a win against a battling portsmouth side just as it looked like the premiership leaders would have to settle for a point.  arjen robben curled in a late deflected left-footed shot from the right side of pompey s box to break the home side s brave resistance. chelsea had been continually frustrated but joe cole added a second with a 20-yard shot in injury-time. nigel quashie had pompey s best chance when his effort was tipped over. the fratton park crowd were in good voice as usual and  even though portsmouth more than held their own  chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances. striker didier drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper shaka hislop into a smart save while an unmarked frank lampard had a strike blocked by arjan de zeeuw. but pompey chased  harried and unsettled a chelsea side as the south-coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through quashie.  the midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper petr cech tipped over at full stretch. pompey stretched arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure. velimir zajec s players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but  just as they took a stranglehold of the match  the visitors launched a counter-attack. drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper hislop back as he blocked before arjan de zeeuw cleared the danger.  the home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a glen johnson header fell to gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded pompey goalmouth. the icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over. but  just like against arsenal  portsmouth let in a late goal when robben s shot took a deflection off matthew taylor on its way past a wrong-footed hislop. and cole put a bit of gloss on a hard-fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the pompey net.  hislop  griffin  primus  de zeeuw  taylor  stone (cisse 76)  quashie (berkovic 83)  faye  o neil  kamara (fuller 65)  yakubu.  subs not used: berger  ashdown.  kamara.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  johnson  duff  makelele  smertin (cole 73)  lampard  robben (geremi 81)  drogba (gudjohnsen 58).  subs not used: cudicini  bridge.  paulo ferreira  robben  lampard.  robben 79  cole 90.  20 210  a wiley (staffordshire).
sport,kuznetsova  failed a drugs test  us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug  according to belgian authorities.  belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 december. kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time. eerdekens said:  there is a problem. ephedrine was discovered. she remains innocent until proved guilty. she can ask for it to be tested again.  the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency (wada)  the international tennis federation (itf) or the women s tennis accosiation (wta). the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested.  speaking at the australian open on monday  before eerdekens identified her  kuznetsova said:  i m not worried. i m not using anything to push myself.  i have not been notified of any positive test  and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did.  eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain  as well as to the belgian prosecutors  office and the belgian and russian tennis federations. he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance.  we have simply stated a fact   he said.  it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence.   either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection.  however  kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev.  first of all  this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing  without any basic evidence   tarpishchev said.  we all know the basic principle in doping cases. if there is a positive sample  then they should notify the international tennis federation (itf) as well as the national federation within three days   he said.  this is not the case here. as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials  nor did the itf.  today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it.  if wada (the world anti-doping agency) was behind the testing  then we would also have known something by now.  otherwise  all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.

politics,voters  reject eu by two to one  british voters would reject the european constitution by two to one  according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.  the daily telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. however the yougov poll  which questioned 1 943 british adults online  found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. another 7% said they would not vote at all. the poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum  expected in 2006. the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote.  ballot papers in the poll will ask:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.  the treaty was signed by all 25 current eu members in rome last october and is due to come into force in november 2006  providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe  but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu.  if we reject this treaty  britain will be isolated and weak in europe   said foreign secretary jack straw  after the question was unveiled. mr straw  along with the rest of the cabinet  will back a  yes  vote. meanwhile  conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question  seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution  when they should be treated as  two separate issues .
politics,lib dems unveil women s manifesto the liberal democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women.  charles kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments. he also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. both labour and the conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support. mr kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women.  two million pensioners in britain currently live below the government s own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women   he said.  he says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. the lib dem s citizen s pension  based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions  would address that imbalance  mr kennedy argues. under the package  new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of £170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. mr kennedy also believes the party s plans to use the money saved from not introducing  illiberal  id cards to boost police numbers by 10 000 would appeal to women too. the policies are not new announcements  but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.  mr kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party s candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women. party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by 4%. mr kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on bbc radio 4 s women s hour on monday. during the interview mr kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party s general election campaign around the birth of his first child  which is expected in april. the baby and his wife sarah would be  priority number one  even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign  he said.  party strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success. a party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and open-minded in deciding who they vote for. labour s deputy minister for women jacqui smith accused the lib dems of offering  false promises  to women and said their sums did not add up. she said:  these proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year  and hard working families will pay dearly  through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services . the labour party has committed itself to  universal  affordable and flexible  childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds  including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm. in september  trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave  higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers  if labour won a third term. the conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in november they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like  on a nanny  au pair or even a family member  such as a grandparent  acting as a carer. they were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.
politics,tories attack eu asylum moves david blunkett has been accused of using the  politics of confusion  to disguise new eu immigration measures.  tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain. the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.  he argued closer co-operation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk.  if we don t like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the british people   he said. the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis.  the government is employing the politics of confusion - i think  deliberately   argued mr davis.  by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto.  on monday tony blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of british borders. he said an enlarged 25-member eu needs a streamlined decision making process. mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant.  he accused the government of being  pathetic  when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of  surrendering  on the issue. and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution  which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over. mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the  best of both worlds  and would keep the veto.  there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls   he said.  with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago  we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe.  mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.  the 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy  in favour of the qualified majority voting (qmv) system. under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states. britain is expected to retain an  opt-in  right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution.  if we don t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours   said mr oaten.  the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it s right that we don t do this in isolation.
politics,labour chooses manchester the labour party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool  it has been confirmed.  the much trailed decision was ratified by labour s ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. it will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event. blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.  for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool  bournemouth and brighton. and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. in 1998 the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in 2002. the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference.  colin asplin  blackpool hotel association said:  we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool.  obviously we have failed in that. i just hope manchester can handle the crowds.  it amazes me that the labour party  which is a working class party  doesn t want to come to the main working class resort in the country.  the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement.
politics,blunkett hints at election call ex-home secretary david blunkett has given fresh clues that the general election will be announced on monday.  he told bbc radio five live:  i m out in my constituency getting ready for what we presume will be an announcement very shortly at the weekend.  he clarified that he meant he would be in his sheffield seat this weekend  not that he expected an election call then. tony blair is tipped to ask the queen on monday to dissolve parliament ready for a 5 may poll.
sport,young debut cut short by ginepri fifteen-year-old donald young s first appearance in an atp tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the san jose open.  young shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys  singles at january s australian open. but the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow american robby ginepri in straight sets  6-2 6-2  in california. despite that he was happy with his tour debut.  it was fun. i had my chances  but they didn t come through   he said. young  who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14  was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games. and ginepri - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.   he s very talented   said ginepri.  he s got a long future ahead of him.  being left-handed  he was very quick around the court.  his serve is a little deceptive. he came into the net and volleyed better than i thought.  earlier  south korean hyung-taik lee defeated american jan-michael gambill 6-3 7-6 (7-4). american kevin kim defeated jan hernych of the czech republic 7-5 6-3  canadian qualifier frank dancevic downed american jeff morrison 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-0  and denmark s kenneth carlsen beat irakli labadze of the republic of georgia 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. top seed andy roddick launches his defence of the title on wednesday against qualifier paul goldstein. second seed andre agassi opens his campaign on tuesday against wildcard bobby reynolds  last year s us collegiate champion. agassi has won the san jose five times  but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to mardy fish in the semi-finals. fish went on to lose to roddick in the final.
sport,wenger shock at newcastle dip arsenal manager arsene wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table.  the gunners travel to st james  park on wednesday  with newcastle 14th in the premiership after a troubled season. and wenger said:  at the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four.  i don t know how they got to be where they are. it looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries.   arsenal go into the game on the back of a 2-0 victory over fulham on sunday. and wenger added:  the best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one. we will go to newcastle in good shape.  fatigue won t play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so i can rotate a bit more.  we do not play a season with 11 players and i believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team.  striker thierry henry  along with robert pires  scored against fulham. and henry afterwards described the display as  beautiful to watch . he said:  what matters is winning and the three points  of course. that is the only thing that really matters. but it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against fulham.  we are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that. those were games we lost.
sport,kenteris denies faking road crash greek sprinter kostas kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the olympics.  kenteris and fellow sprinter katerina thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week. part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. kenteris insisted:  the accident happened. i went crazy when i found out i had supposedly missed a test and i wanted to rush to the olympic village.  kenteris  speaking on greece s alter television station  also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash.  i told the hospital  which was an olympics-accredited hospital  to call the ioc and have me tested on the spot but no-one came.   after a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in greece as athens prepared for the start of the athens games  kenteris and thanou eventually withdrew. but kenteris has continually protested his innocence - and on sunday blamed greek olympic committee officials and his former coach christos tzekos for failing to inform him of the test. the 31-year-old insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name.  if a decision is taken to have charges filed against me  i will accept it gladly.  a prosecution means that the case will be cleared... i want to go to the end and then we ll see who s right and who isn t.  kenteris  a greek hero after winning gold in the 200m at the 2000 olympics in sydney  also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the athens opening ceremony.  i had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron   he said.
sport,clijsters set for february return tennis star kim clijsters will make her return from a career-threatening injury at the antwerp wta event in february.   kim had considered returning to action in paris on 7 february   a statement on her website said.  she s decided against this so that she does not risk the final phase of her recovery. if all goes well  kim will make her return on february 15.  the 21-year-old has not played since last october after aggravating a wrist injury at the belgian open. back then  a doctor treating the belgian feared that her career may be over  with the player having already endured an operation earlier in the season to cure her wrist problem.  i hope she comes back  but i m pessimistic   said bruno willems. clijsters was also due to marry fellow tennis star lleyton hewitt in february but the pair split  for private reasons  back in october.
sport,williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby.  the chairman  chief executive and three non-executive directors all departed in a row over the game s future direction. but williams said:  i want to make it clear that i m committed totally to scottish rugby.  i ve brought my family here and we ve immersed ourselves in scottish life. there s no way that i m walking away.  however  he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute.  i d like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation   he said.   when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you  who are jealous and want to try to drag you down.  when you have that situation  you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through.  there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case.  like all good coaches  you go and ask for an increase. but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that.  the idea that we are lighting cigars with £20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue.  we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team.  but let me give you the truth. our irish counterparts  whom we have to compete with in a few days  time  had 70 days together at the summer.  they are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the six nations.  that means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nations. we  on the other hand  will have 16.  there must be a win-win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after - both groups winning  not competing.
politics,no-one can define new hunt ban  the new law banning hunting with dogs is  so poorly drafted  no-one can define the offence  pro-hunt mps say.  the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to  chase away unwanted animals  from his farm. because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.  north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group  of which mr opik is a co-chairman  after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry  defra. he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act. mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was  not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence .  mr opik said:  hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act.  now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting -  chasing away  which isn t even covered by the act.  however  all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals.  how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting  exempt hunting  drag hunting  unintentional hunting  a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away   tory mp peter luff  another co-chairman of middle way  said that the legislation was  so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence .   it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. however  i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating.  mike hobday  of the league against cruel sports  said:  there is no confusion  it is a matter of simple common sense.  if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.  if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer  then nobody can define that as hunting.
sport,harinordoquy suffers france axe number eight imanol harinordoquy has been dropped from france s squad for the six nations match with ireland in dublin on 12 march.  harinordoquy was a second-half replacement in last saturday s 24-18 defeat to wales. bourgoin lock pascal pape  who has recovered from a sprained ankle  returns to the 22-man squad. wing cedric heymans and ludovic valbon come in for aurelien rougerie and jean-philippe grandclaude.  rougerie hurt his chest against wales while grandclaude was a second-half replacement against both england and wales. valbon  capped in last june s tests against the united states and canada  was a second half replacement in the win over scotland.  france coach bernard laporte said harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend.  imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least i can say is that he didn t make a thundering comeback against wales   said laporte.  we know the ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed  and gregory lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight.  the grand slam is gone but we ll go to ireland to win.  it will be a very exciting game because ireland have three wins under their belt  have just defeated england and have their eyes set on a grand slam.  france  who lost to wales last week  must defeat the irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the six nations trophy. ireland are unbeaten in this year s tournament and have their sights set on a first grand slam since 1948.  dimitri yachvili (biarritz)  pierre mignoni (clermont)  yann delaigue (castres)  frederic michalak (stade toulousain)  damien traille (biarritz)  yannick jauzion (stade toulousain)  ludovic valbon (biarritz)  christophe dominici (stade francais)  cedric heymans (stade toulousain)  julien laharrague (brive)  sylvain marconnet (stade francais)  nicolas mas (perpignan)  olivier milloud (bourgoin)  sebastien bruno (sale/eng)  william servat (stade toulousain)  fabien pelous (stade toulousain  capt)  jerome thion (biarritz)  pascal pap&#233; (bourgoin)  gregory lamboley (stade toulousain)  serge betsen (biarritz)  julien bonnaire (bourgoin)  yannick nyanga (b&#233;ziers)
sport,paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris   and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978  those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. welsh legend mervyn davies  a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s  hailed it as  one of the great performances of the past three decades . martyn williams  wales  two-try scorer on the day  called it  one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . a crestfallen france coach  bernard laporte  simply observed:  there was a french half and there was a welsh half . and what a half it was for the red dragonhood  transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure  the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side. that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time  then reverse it on the resumption  was remarkable enough. but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes  wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.  in international rugby  any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day  but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory  the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago. but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup  wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.   the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class   noted coach mike ruddock. the likes of michael owen  gethin jenkins  dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand. and players like stephen jones  martyn williams  shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. jones  after his superb man-of-the-match display  observed that  we are a very happy camp now . ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that  ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. the  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.  if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship  they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. similarly  wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches  and that forward power  mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. so on to murrayfield  where wales have not won on their last three visits. while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive  the players will set about the task of beating scotland. only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s  and writing their own names into welsh legend.
sport,newcastle line up babayaro newcastle manager graeme souness is closing in on signing chelsea defender celestine babayaro when the transfer window reopens.  souness is bidding to bolster his defence and  according to reports  contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. babayaro has been in the premiership since 1997 when he moved to chelsea for £2.25m from anderlecht. but the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players.  but he said:  all i can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals.  we have said from day one we want to strengthen  and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks.
politics,brown targets oaps and homebuyers gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120 000 as he put the economy at the heart of labour s election campaign.  the chancellor also unveiled a one-off £200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. mr brown put 1p a pint on beer  4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september. the tories called it a  vote now  pay later  budget. the lib dems branded it a  sticking plaster  for the election.  tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labour s  faltering  election campaign.   this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces   mr howard told mps.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  he ended his response with an election challenge to labour  saying  bring it on . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.  how can it be right in britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax  as a proportion of their income  than the richest 20%   he asked.  mr kennedy criticised mr brown for failing to mention the  ticking bomb  of council tax revaluation  saying it was  high time  the system was replaced by a  local tax based on the ability to pay . during his 49 minute speech mr brown told mps he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.  he said his budget struck a balance  between tax cuts that are affordable  investments that are essential and stability that is paramount . he rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. the child tax credit will rise in line with earnings  giving families an extra £5 a week. in contrast  the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4 745 to £4 895 next month. mr brown told mps child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children. despite his giveaways  budget documents show mr brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. he also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. bbc political editor andrew marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. but trust in mr brown s economic stewardship would be a central election issue  he said.  mr brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the queen mother  funded through a special coin to celebrate the queen s 80th birthday. other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the council of mortgage lenders to boost low cost home ownership. the level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £263 000 to £275 000 from april. mr brown said he had met his financial  golden rule  with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.  the economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters  he said  and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year  with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. the first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the gershon review have been achieved  the chancellor said. some 12 500 civil servant posts have been axed  and 7 800 relocated out of the south east of england  he added. snp leader alex salmond said mr brown had failed the  tartan test  as there were no measures to boost the scottish economy. simon thomas  of plaid cymru  called it a budget for middle england. uk independence party leader roger knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed  more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want   not  free bus rides . the green party said the budget was a  wasted opportunity  for environmental protection  adding:  brown obviously has an eye on the coming election  and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.
politics,lib dems unveil election slogan the liberal democrats will present themselves as  the real alternative  in the forthcoming general election campaign  charles kennedy has said.  unveiling the slogan at the party s spring conference  he said there was no  glass ceiling  to its ambitions. he told delegates that labour had abused the public s trust and that the tories had failed to oppose them. in response  the conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the  forgotten majority .  speaking in harrogate mr kennedy said:  people want a credible  principled political party which offers a different vision of what britain can be.   only the liberal democrats stood against the iraq war  he said  and they had also provided strong opposition to the government s plans on id cards  anti-terror measures and taxation. he said:  if you voted conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you  your vote was wasted.  what people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister.  responding to the claims tory party co-chairman liam fox said:  like labour  the lib dems are soft on crime  support higher taxes  oppose controlled immigration and support giving europe more control over our lives.   mr kennedy also outlined his party s plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over £100 000 a year. the money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees  scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax  and providing free care for the elderly  he said. labour and the tories claim the sums do not add up  and that working families would be hardest hit. mr kennedy said:  britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. we have world class businesses and a world class workforce.   so why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line   all the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in may  although prime minister tony blair has not confirmed any timing. earlier  mr kennedy told radio 4 s today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with labour in the event of a hung parliament.  we go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party   he said. mr kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing monday s commons vote on the government s controversial anti-terrorism laws  along with 16 other lib dem mps. on saturday  the lib dem chief executive said it was  just a cock-up  that mr kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote  which the government won by a majority of only 14.  nobody had any idea that was going to happen   lord rennard told reporters at the party conference. he said he was certain mps would get another chance to vote against the plans.

sport,melzer shocks agassi second seed andre agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarter-finals of the sap open.  agassi was often bamboozled by the austrian s drop shots in san jose  losing 6-3 6-1. defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat sweden s thomas enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5. but unseeded cyril saulnier beat the fourth seed vincent spadea 6-2 6-4 and tommy haas overcame eighth seed max mirnyi 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. melzer has now beaten agassi in two of their three meetings.   i had a good game plan and i executed it perfectly   he said.  it s always tough to come out to play andre.  i didn t want him to play his game. he makes you run like a dog all over the court.  and agassi  who was more than matched for power by his opponent s two-handed backhand  said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him.  a lot more guys are capable of it now   said the american.  he played much better than me. that s what he did both times.  i had opportunities to loosen myself up   agassi added.  but i didn t convert on the big points.
politics,cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down  local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged.  gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. mr raynsford said he had held some  pretty frank discussions  with fellow ministers over the plans. but he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.  the central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year s council tax rises below 5%  in what is likely to be a general election year.  mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities. and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues.  obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this   he told bbc radio 4 s the world at one. but he said there was a recognition that  a good settlement for local government  was important to health  education and  other government departments . ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without  unreasonable council tax increases   he added. mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.   this is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face.  mr raynsford also plans to make savings of £100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes. these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early. he insisted the changes were  very modest  and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring  very early . but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans.  if you want world class public services you don t get that by hitting people as they approach retirement.
sport,robinson answers critics england captain jason robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline.  england were beaten 11-9 by wales in their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday. robinson said:  we are certainly not on the decline. you lose one game and it doesn t make you a bad team.  i have no doubt in the players we ve got. we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day.  england find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987. but full-back robinson believes the new-look england team can stop the rot against france.   last weekend we should have won the game   he said.  but if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then i am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need.  we proved that in the autumn - when we put in some excellent performances - and we just need to build on that.   it was a disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that.  but we are certainly not out. we will come out fighting this week.  robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old newcastle centre mathew tait  who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france.   i have had a word with mathew   said robinson.  i still believe in him. he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly (barkley) because of the kicking.  mathew has just got to take it on the chin  keep working hard like he is doing and i m sure he will feature in some of the games.
politics,muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives.  the event is being held by the muslim association of britain (mab)  which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. last year mab  which opposed the war in iraq  urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections. but a spokesman stressed the meeting was  not necessarily anti-labour .  this meeting is not anti-party in particular  it s anti-policy  it s on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on   mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday s event.   there are issues of concern to muslims  and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.  dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq  the palestinian situation  the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic  social and education problems.  approximately 1.1m of the uk s 1.6m muslims are of voting age. previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour  but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters.  anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason  with many saying it was  unjustified . representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday s event. among them will be the muslim council of britain (mcb). the chairman of the mcb s public affairs committee  sher khan  said the war in iraq would be a  significant factor  affecting muslims  voting intentions.  i think it s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact   mr khan said.  however  professor john curtice  of the university of strathclyde  is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make.  for the most part the labour constituencies where there s a large muslim community are relatively safe  but there are one or two that are not quite so safe   professor curtice said.  the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green  in east london  and rochdale in lancashire  he added. in bethnal green  former labour mp george galloway  who founded the anti-war party respect  is standing against sitting mp oona king  who had a 10 000-vote majority in 2001. in rochdale  the liberal democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour - secured second place in the 2001 election  securing just under 6 000 votes fewer than labour s lorna fitzsimons. but professor curtice said the muslim anti-war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect  meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.  ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats  which is generally the case   he said. but dr tamimi said mab s intention was not to  empower  the tories.  we know the next government will be labour  but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly.  if the next labour government has a reduced majority that s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country   dr tamimi said.
sport,serena ends sania mirza s dream sania mirza  the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event  has lost to women s favourite serena williams.  the 18-year-old mirza  who got a wild card entry into the australian open in melbourne  lost to williams 1-6 4-6 in the third round. williams took just 56 minutes to defeat mirza and sail into the fourth round. the only other indian woman to win a match at a grand slam is nirupama vaidyanathan. vaidyanathan made it to the second round of the australian open in 1998.  playing the biggest match of her life  mirza made little impact on williams in the early stages of the game. but the teenager showed more confidence in the second set and engaged the seventh-seeded williams in some well contested rallies. mirza  a junior wimbledon doubles title winner  became the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event when she beat hungarian petra mandula on wednesday.  i m really excited. i was confident but i didn t think it was going to be that easy   mirza said after her second round win.  my aim was to win a round here. when i did that i was so relieved  there was no pressure.  tennis is not a particularly popular sport in india  but a number of indians watched the live telecast of the match between mirza and williams. mirza  who lives in the southern indian city of hyderabad known for producing a host of top indian cricketers  turned professional two years ago. she says she was considered too small when she went for her first tennis classes as a six-year-old girl.  then finally [the coach] called my parents up and said  the way she hits the ball  i ve never seen a six-year-old hit a ball like that    mirza told the associated press.
sport,tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were  robbed  at manchester united after pedro mendes  shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.   the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can t we just stop the game and get the decision right   said jol after the 0-0 draw.  but at the end of the day it s so obvious that pedro s shot was over the line it s incredible.  we feel robbed but it s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it.  mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. jol added:  we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line  it was a metre inside the goal.  what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005  watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn t told about it.   we didn t play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point  although we should have had three.  mendes could not believe the  goal  was not given after seeing a replay. he said:  my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate.  it was a very nice goal  it was clearly over the line - i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career.  it s really  really over. what can you do but laugh about it  it s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn t count.  it s not every game you score from the halfway line.  manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology.  i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that s that technology should play a part in the game   ferguson told mutv.  what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays.  but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can t make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.   thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. so you wouldn t be wasting a lot of time.  i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football.  arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.  when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford  that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence   said wenger.  it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.
sport,bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter.  with both sides looking for their first win of the championship  the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs.  it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win   said the lock forward. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000  but two of those have come against scotland. this year  italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17.  however  they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out. now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations.  scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh   said bortolami.  we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs.  as a nation  our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.
politics,blair  pressing us on climate  tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol  downing street has indicated.  officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair. climate change was an issue the prime minister  wanted to progress  during the uk s presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005  said a spokesman. but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new us-friendly treaty.  according to the times  the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a  kyoto-lite  agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10. the prime minister is said to believe the united states  refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries  resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. president bush s advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.  europe  which disputes the claim  has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries. mr blair s reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions  says the times. but there is still apparently  little prospect  of america agreeing to cut emissions  which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.
politics,mps issued with blackberry threat mps will be thrown out of the commons if they use blackberries in the chamber speaker michael martin has ruled.  the £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone  pager or to send e-mails. the devices gained new prominence this week after alastair campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a newsnight journalist. mr martin revealed some mps had been using their blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces.  the use of electronic devices in the commons chamber has long been frowned on. the sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the speaker or his deputies. the speaker chairs debates in the commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the house. he or she is always an mp chosen by colleagues who  once nominated  gives up all party political allegiances.
politics,jowell confirms casino climbdown tessa jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the uk to 24  in a move branded a  humiliating retreat  by the tories.  it puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos  originally outlined in the government s gambling bill. instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small  medium and large. the culture secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.  but conservative shadow culture secretary john whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a  shambles .  this announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government.  instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill  to liberalise the rules governing gambling  the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present.  shares in british casino operators london clubs international  rank group and stanley leisure  who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos  fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement. ms jowell s deputy  richard caborn  said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue  and responded to the concerns raised.  limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling   he said.  we also believe it s right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos.   he added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas. church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos. salvation army spokesman jonathan lomax said:  the proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period  which we think should last at least five years  will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling.  but british british casino association chairman penny cobham said her members were  outraged  by the decision  which followed a campaign in the daily mail newspaper.  there was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos. talk of a casino on every high street was just a scaring tactic.

sport,officials respond in court row australian tennis  top official has defended the australian open courts at melbourne park after criticism of the playing surface by lleyton hewitt.  hewitt said he had had a  gutful  of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but tennis australia s geoff pollard rejected his comments.  we did ask for it to be made faster than last year and  to my knowledge  it is faster   he said.  we spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster.  hewitt  who has not got past the fourth round at melbourne in seven attempts  had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament. but he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. the tournament starts on 17 january  and pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year s tournament following complaints by several australian players. but he refused to accept that the melbourne surface may have had a bearing on hewitt s performances over the years.  lleyton s proving how versatile he is on all surfaces   he said.  it is faster than last year and that ll be faster than the one lleyton beat roger federer on in the davis cup in 2003.
politics,clarke plans migrant point scheme anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country  home secretary charles clarke has said.  he is proposing a points system similar to australia s but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke  who will unveil his plans on monday  said economic migration helped the uk but  needed proper policing . the lib dems say they will look at his plans  but tory liam fox said his party offered a  clear choice  on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had  done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit  on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas.  the home secretary said  by 2008  he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken  to  ensure we can know everybody who is in the country . speaking on bbc one s breakfast with frost  he said  economic migrants are of great value to this country   but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a  burden on society . he said:  we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills  talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country  and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.   the home secretary  whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday  also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry.  the issue of who does come into this country  and whether they are entitled to be in this country  who does settle here  how we have border controls  is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate   he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum  the jury is still out on the home office s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.   mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the world s  genuine refugees . but he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity. trevor phillips  chairman of the commission for racial equality  called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britain s hospitality was being tested by immigration.  tell that to the 44 000 doctors in the nhs and the 70 000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means   he said.  ditto the teachers  from south africa  australia  jamaica  who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.  the refugee council said mr howard s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.
politics,anglers  could face prosecution  anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty  a committee of mps has warned.  sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended  the environment select committee said. the mps said they were  concerned  the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved  mps said.  they called for a  cast-iron guarantee  that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation  and intends to protect  kept animals  and  companion  animals by setting up a  duty of care . in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences  it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing  mutilation  of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal s best interest.  the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail.  we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government s intention to exempt fishing as an activity.   but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought.  however  in exempting fishing  the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given  carte blanche  to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity   the committee added. the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill  such as the law on abandonment of animals which  would be significantly weakened . mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect  or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.  committee chairman michael jack said:  any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.  this draft bill is no exception. my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.  but mr jack said the bill  very much had the feel of a  work in progress   and urged the government to guarantee that  an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law  before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs  circuses and game bird farms.  the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament   he added.
sport,cudicini misses carling cup final chelsea goalkeeper carlo cudicini will miss sunday s carling cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against newcastle.  the italian was sent off for bringing down shola ameobi in the final minute of sunday s match. blues boss jose mourinho had promised to pick cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper petr cech. the 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.  cudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for chelsea  but petr cech has established himself as first choice for mourinho since moving to stamford bridge in summer 2004. the 22-year-old czech republic international has set a new premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal  a mark which is still running. but mourinho has used cudicini regularly in the carling cup  and the italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during chelsea s run to the final.

politics,pre-poll clash on tax and spend labour and the tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over gordon brown s budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle.  tony blair claimed a tory government would  cut  £35bn from public services hitting schools  hospitals and police. tory chairman liam fox accused labour of  at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie  and said the  smear  tactics were a sign of desperation. the lib dems accused mr brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises.  appearing together at a labour poster launch  the prime minister hailed his chancellor s  brilliant  performance. and he claimed the tories would cut £35bn from public services  which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the uk.  the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of £33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by 2011. but they say not a single doctor  teacher or nurse will be cut. dr fox said:  we have said we will be spending more  year on year over and above inflation.  and to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation  at worst a downright lie.   tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin also predicted mr brown would have to raise taxes by £10bn or £11bn if labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much. for the lib dems  vince cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the  looming problems  of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in  massive increases  for some. mr brown and mr blair staged a show of unity on thursday morning  the day after the chancellor delivered a record-breaking ninth budget.  mr cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties. the chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were  affordable . in wednesday s budget  mr brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty  unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a £200 council tax refund for over-65s. defending the plans  he told today:  i will take no risks with the stability of the economy.  all our spending plans announced yesterday [wednesday]  including what we can do for pensioners  as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax  all these are costed and affordable.  in a further sign  if any were needed  that the election is approaching  the house of commons authorities have formally told mps their offices will be  deep cleaned  during the three-week poll campaign. mr blair has yet to name the day - but it is widely expected to be 5 may.
sport,holmes secures comeback victory britain s kelly holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double olympic gold with 1500m victory at the norwich union international.  holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell-out crowd in glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds.  it was nice to get that out of the way. i was nervous about whether i would actually be able to get round.  i felt good. i just had to relax and use my racing knowledge   said holmes.  it was all about winning in front of my home crowd. the time is irrelevant.  i got round in one piece and didn t disgrace myself. now it s about going forward.  the reception i ve had since the olympics has been amazing and that s why i wanted to keep running this year  because i get a buzz from the crowd.  holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of france s hind dehiba and russia s svetlana cherkasova. the olympic 800m and 1500m champion s time was inside the qualifying mark for the european indoor championships in madrid in march. but the 34-year-old would not reveal whether she intended to run or not  having previously indicated she would leave a decision until after the birmingham grand prix on 18 february.
sport,williams battles to aussie title serena williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title.  the 2003 champion claimed her seventh grand slam title  and her first since wimbledon in 2003  2-6 6-3 6-0. williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games. she quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as davenport s game collapsed  allowing williams to take the title. williams later explained her injury problem  saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set.  lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back  thank goodness   she said. davenport paid tribute to williams  saying:  she s had a tough couple of years and she s come back like a champion.   the 23-year-old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action. davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second.  i kept thinking to myself  i m not losing this game   said williams afterwards.   i don t care if my arm falls off  i m not losing this game . and i guess that s what happened.  i didn t want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum  and a lot of confidence.  despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at 3-3  but from 40-0 up she just folded. williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks.  i felt like i was playing well and in control pretty much of the match   said davenport.  then i just had that horrible lapse  i think serving up 40-0  and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it.  at the end i think i was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going - she s a great frontrunner when she gets going.
politics,iraq advice claim sparks new row the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number 10.  downing street has denied the claims  made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith s advice. lord goldsmith also denied them  saying he was not  leaned on  in any way. but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general.  the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmith s advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. it said it was  plain  iraq continued to be in material breach of un resolution 1441. in his new book  lawless world  philippe sands  a qc and international law professor  suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street. according to mr sands  lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on 7 march 2003 that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  mr sands told newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case  in case legal action was taken against the uk over the war. on 10 march  military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. the book  being serialised in the guardian newspaper  says on 13 march lord goldsmith met then home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan.  after that downing street proceeded to set out his [lord goldsmith s] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 march   said mr sands.  tory leader michael howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general  warning:  this issue will not go away.   these revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war.  the government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.  liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell repeated his party s calls for lord goldsmith s first piece of legal advice to be made public.  the public interest  which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice  can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.   in a statement to newsnight  lord goldsmith said:  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions.  it was certainly not a view that i expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way  nor as i have already made clear  was it written by or at number 10.  the prime minister s official spokesman also rejected the claims  saying:  the attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.  but ex-foreign secretary robin cook says all the advice should now be published. he said the claims suggested parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of lord goldsmith s second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in no 10. this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement  mr cook said  because the attorney general s advice should be an  independent legal opinion   not subject to  political negotiation of this kind .
politics,uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv/aids.  an estimated 25 000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. about 800 000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader. the five-year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.  the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. it was overshadowed by rwanda s emergence from the 100 days of slaughter  during which time the mass killings took place  and the women s fate was largely a taboo subject. but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but  in many cases  orphans too.  as the women die  the number of rwanda s orphans rises. until recently  very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. that is now starting to change. this funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2 500 women. mary kayitesi blewitt  founder of the survivors fund (surf)  one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled  said it was a recognition  before it was too late  that the survivors should be a priority for help.

politics,uk youth  interested  in politics the majority of young people are interested in politics  holding  strong opinions  on policies and have a  keen appetite  for direct action.  research undertaken for voting watchdog the electoral commission suggests 81% of 16 to 20-year-olds feel strongly about issues like crime and education. the survey findings are being released to coincide with the launch of the y vote mock elections 2005 initiative. mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the uk.  electoral commission boss sam younger said:  we know that young people often feel disengaged from democratic life and we believe in working creatively to encourage their interest and participation.  mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters   he said. the survey of a sample of 500 british 16 to 20-year-olds and 500 21 to 25-year olds  showed britain s young people are far from apathetic about issues that matter to most of their lives . the y vote initiative is being run jointly by the electoral commission  the hansard society and the department for education and skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election  possibly on 5 may. michael rafferty  who is mock elections project manager at the hansard society  said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the uk participating in the mock votes.
sport,henman decides to quit davis cup tim henman has retired from great britain s davis cup team.  the 30-year-old  who made his davis cup debut in 1994  is now set to fully focus on the atp tour and on winning his first grand slam event.  i ve made no secret of the fact that representing great britain has always been a top priority for me throughout my career   henman told his website. captain jeremy bates has touted alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as possible replacements for the veteran. henman added that he was available to help britain in its bid for davis cup success  with the next tie against israel in march .  although i won t be playing  i would still like to make myself available to both jeremy and the lta in the future so that i can draw upon my experience in the hope of trying to help the british players develop their full potential   he added.  i ve really enjoyed playing in front of the thousands of british fans both home and abroad and would like to thank every one of them for their unwavering support over the years.  henman leaves davis cup tennis with an impressive record  having won 36 of his 50 matches. great britain captain jeremy bates paid tribute to henman s efforts over the years.   tim has quite simply had a phenomenal davis cup career and it has been an absolute privilege to have captained the team with him in it   said bates.  tim s magnificent record speaks for itself. while it s a great loss i completely understand and respect his decision to retire from davis cup and focus on the grand slams and tour.    looking to the future this decision obviously marks a watershed in british davis cup tennis but it is also a huge opportunity for the next generation to make their mark.  we have a host of talented players coming through and despite losing someone of tim s calibre  i remain very optimistic about the future.  henman made his davis cup debut in 1994 against romania in manchester. he and partner bates won their doubles rubber on the middle saturday of the tie. britain eventually lost the contest 3-2. henman and britain had little luck in davis cup matches until 1999 when they qualified for the world group. britain drew the usa and lost the tie when greg rusedski fell to jim courier in the deciding rubber. they made the final stages again  in 2002  but this time lost out to the might of sweden.
politics,research fears over kelly s views scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary ruth kelly s religious views could hamper vital scientific research.  ms kelly  who is catholic  is reported to be  pro-life  and has opposed embryo research. medical research council professor nancy rothwell said ms kelly s views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists. the department for education and skills would not comment on the concerns.  a spokeswoman said:  it is not news that ms kelly is a catholic but we are not going into any details on this.  but she added that claims ms kelly was in charge of a £1bn university research budget were not true. it was down to the higher education funding council and the research councils to decide on universities  research allocations. british law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells  master cells that can develop into all the body s tissue types. this cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments. however  it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos.  professor rothwell  who is also vice-president of research at manchester university  told the times higher education supplement it would worry her  a great deal  if ministers were anti-stem cell. she said:  the views of ministers in the dfes do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists.  you can t have a higher education policy that is at odds with the government s science policy.  head of developmental genetics at the national institute of medical research  professor robin lovell-badge  said he had witnessed the confused situation in the us where many religious groups opposed the practice. he said:  if someone as senior as ruth kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country. it is very worrying.  but fertility expert lord winston said he thought it was  rather good  ministers held ethical views. concerns have also been raised by  pro-choice  organisations that ms kelly s views might affect sex education policy in schools.  family planning association chief executive  anne weyman  said teaching pupils about contraception and abortion were key.  young people must be informed about all the issues within sexual health  which include contraception and abortion.  i think it is very important that the government maintains its commitment to the teenage pregnancy strategy.  currently  individual schools devise their own sex education policies based on a framework provided by the dfes. ms kelly has not set out her detailed views on either issue yet  but has said she intends to put parents first in education policy. this would include the quality of teaching  classroom discipline and academic standards in schools  she said.
politics,job cuts  false economy   - tuc plans to shed 71 000 civil service jobs will prove to be a  false economy  that could hamper public sector reforms  according to a tuc report.  public and commercial services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 november. the tuc said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the £22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. general secretary brendan barber warned the  costs could easily outweigh the benefits .  the government s big boost to public spending is now showing results   said mr barber.  public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.   they may shoot a tory fox  but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. the costs could easily outweigh the benefits.  next friday s strike action by the pcs is the biggest in the civil service since 1993  hitting jobcentres  benefit agencies  pensions offices  customs and driving tests. the union says it is concerned about pensions  sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and jobcentres across the uk would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. the number of civil servants in britain rose to more than 520 000 in april. other areas the strike will affect include passports  museums and galleries  libraries and health and safety inspections.

politics,labour faces  cold calls  inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on  cold calling  householders.  the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres. the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. labour denies breaking rules. it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people s voting intentions. the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.  telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists  which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a  flagrant and systematic breach  of the laws governing the tps.  he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about  identifying target voters . and it quotes a stevenage labour party members  newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.  the voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention  ranging from  labour (firm)  to  target (conservative)  - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory. the newsletter says:  using the information we know about people  we can send them direct mailings.  for example  we could send the target (conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.   mr taylor tells the commissioner:  it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large-scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.  insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers  it is equally clear that it is unlawful.  the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour.  a spokeswoman for the information commissioner s office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be mr taylor s.  we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us   she said.  obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations.  the commissioner s office will now examine the lib dem evidence.  the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on   said the spokeswoman. if labour is judged to have broken the rules  it will be asked stop immediately. if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters  the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.  the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal. if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules  it could be fined up to £5 000. labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making  voter identification  calls. asked about the commissioner s inquiry  a labour spokesman told bbc news:  we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. however  we are absolutely clear that we haven t broken any rules.  as the information commissioner himself has said  if people are not marketing something  if they are asking them which way they are going to vote  they are not in breach of the law.  we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again.
politics,faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer  says the education watchdog.  independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief  david bell  for not doing enough to promote the  wider tenets of british society . mr bell said muslim  jewish and evangelical christian schools must be  intolerant of intolerance . diversity  certainly must not mean segregated or separate   he said. mr bell s speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.  badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell  and in a speech to the hansard society  he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy  public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 muslim  100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools.  mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a  common heritage  and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.  i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools  with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society   said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools.  many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony.  mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were  tricky issues . but he argued that  we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation .  i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens  equal under the law  should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance  illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community  be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships   said mr bell.
politics,blair and blunkett sheffield trip tony blair is to join home secretary david blunkett in a visit to sheffield on thursday.  mr blunkett s conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. the parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give kimberly quinn free rail tickets. he is also being investigated over the visa application of mrs quinn s ex-nanny. the visit to sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by mr blair.  on wednesday during prime minister s questions  tory leader michael howard went on the offensive over comments mr blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. he is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. mr howard said mr blunkett had complained he had inherited a  giant mess  when he took over at the home office from jack straw  now foreign secretary. the tory leader went on:  he doesn t stop there: he thinks the culture secretary s weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn t think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn t developed as expected.  he says the prime minister doesn t like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.  mr blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.  the home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets  given to him as an mp  to mrs quinn and has since paid the £180 back. he has apologised for  a genuine mistake  and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. the rail tickets are meant to help mps  spouses get between westminster and their constituencies. after his inquiry  parliamentary watchdog sir philip mawer will report to the commons standards and privileges committee  the group of mps who will recommend to the full house of commons what action - if any - should be taken against mr blunkett.  the separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant sir alan budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by mrs quinn s nanny  leoncia casalme  to stay in the uk. last week  mr blunkett won the first round of a high court battle with mrs quinn for access to her son. mr blunkett declined to comment about his own position  saying the inquiry was under way and the high court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. downing street has stressed mr blair s support for the home secretary.
sport,giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday s friendly against hungary in cardiff.  john toshack  in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes  admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark.  with the games he s played for united  proportionately it doesn t seem that many for wales   toshack said.  but he s one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it s appropriate he s captain.  giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game  but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career.  i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex  but he urged me to carry on   giggs said.  he feels  like myself  that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit  so in three or four years  time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.  the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough.   giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team-mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991  an away loss to germany  and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary  there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however  toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a long-term option.  for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain  it s his 50th cap and he s known for some time about that   toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes  and giggs said:  it s my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it  and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in.  it s important to be here  all the players feel the same. it s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important.  i see myself leading by example  it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons.  the way john is looking at things  he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament  the euro 2006 event.  i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament  by then i will be 35 so hopefully i will still be okay.  a lot can happen  but i m hoping to be around.  giggs  own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract  with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two.  i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment   said giggs.  it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that.  i ve heard the suggestions  hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for  to get it sorted out.  i m enjoying my football  the way united have been playing and my own form  you have to enjoy it.  we have massive games coming up: manchester city this week  then the everton cup tie  followed by ac milan in the champions league  and my first wales game under john toshack  so it s an important time.
sport,smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series.  such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa  howard wells  at the next meeting of the four home countries. the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. but smith said:  bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that s something that s needed.  the home international series was done away with in 1984  with the traditional scotland-england fixture continuing until 1989. that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated.  the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season   he added.  i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20 000 fans turned up to watch.  england were criticised for the 0-0 draw against holland - the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies.  you have to put a performance on in friendly games. if you don t  they can be de-motivating.  it can be a dangerous road to go down  if players don t apply themselves in the manner they should.  so i would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.
sport,time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager  a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week  and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  i would say it s 50-50 whether you should have these games or not  and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy  as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together  the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies  though  a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes  let alone a whole team s worth. the debate will rage on  and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter  who is a canny manager.  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten  it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales  and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance  but the public wants results. it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win  people forget them  but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england s game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played.  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers  it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.
politics,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.  the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a  collective view  after holding a  good discussion   but admitted it was  not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.  tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo  his transport and environment spokesman  said the plans  stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would  set out the position very clearly  when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could  help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added:  when the police say that you have to take them seriously .  he acknowledged there were  good libertarian arguments  against the cards  but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the  conflicting interests  before reaching its decision.  i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.  he also denied he was afraid of looking  soft  on the issue  compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.  sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and  deeply flawed . he said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.   the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.  tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a  regressive  step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.

sport,connors boost for british tennis former world number one jimmy connors is planning a long-term relationship with the lawn tennis association to help unearth the next tim henman.  the american spent three days at the lta s annual elite performance winter camp in la manga earlier this week.  britain has the right attitude   said connors.  the more involved i can be with the lta  the better.  a short-term arrangement is just confusing. the kids will ask:  what am i doing there    lta chief executive  john crowther  added:  the relationship that jimmy s already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we d like some more of it.  we want to use jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.   the camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players  including greg rusedski  arvind parmar and anne keothavong.  la manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best   said connors  speaking at queen s club in london.  what impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had.  it was interesting to me to see kids of 15  16  17  with that desire and passion  and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them.  instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can t buy.  they know what s been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort  and every minute of practice they were doing that.   speaking from la manga  lta performance director david felgate told bbc sport:  jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches  and very humble considering what he s achieved.  he worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them.  he made it clear from the word go he didn t want it to be short-term. this is a 52-week-a-year job for me  it s my life and my passion and it s the same with the coaches.  he respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. and why would he stake his reputation on something that s not going to be successful   connors has also agreed to commentate for the bbc at next year s wimbledon championships. he will work during the second week of the tournament.
sport,henman & murray claim lta awards tim henman was named player of the year for 2004 by the lawn tennis association at wimbledon on monday.  the briton was recognised for the best year of his career  which saw him reach the semis at the french and us opens. scotland s andrew murray was named young player of the year after winning the us open juniors  as well as a futures event in italy. and world number one peter norfolk won disabled player of the year after claiming his third us open crown.  great britain s under 14 boys won the team of the year prize for their victory at the world junior tennis event in august. henman will start his 2005 campaign at the kooyong event on 12 january in a field that includes roger federer  andy roddick and andre agassi. and the briton is optimistic of surpassing his best effort of a fourth-round place at the australian open  which begins the following week.  i ve often felt that the conditions suit my game in melbourne so i d love to be able to start next year by doing well at the australian open   henman told his website.  that s why i ve changed my schedule slightly by committing to play in the kooyong classic.  i ll be able to acclimatise while practising before the event and then will be guaranteed matches against the best players in the world.  i think that will give me the best possible chance of doing well at the australian open.
sport,moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back.  jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament  in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson. the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson  a lock forward. and former england captain moore told the bbc:  full-backs are too far away from the action. that s not a reflection on robinson personally.  he added:  i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is  after all  where games usually start and finish.  moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales  france and ireland in this year s tournament.  assertiveness in the pack isn t there  we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns   he explained.  wer e not getting quick ball  which means the backs are being stifled. their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that.   with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson  coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance. and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further.  the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience   moore added.  you can t do anything about that but play them. there are players who have been knocking on the door  it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them.  we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.

sport,iaaf will contest greek decision the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou.  the high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation (segas) last month. now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport (cas) and has suspended both athletes. an iaaf statement said:  the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous.  the statement continued:  both athletes  cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas. the decision in both cases will be final and binding.   segas said the iaaf appeal was  expected  and  understandable.   now we are going to await the final result  which we cannot prejudge   said segas chairman vassilis sevastis. kenteris  who won olympic 200m gold at the 2000 olympics  and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games. however  the independent tribunal overturned those bans  clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics.  kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf s decision as  not unexpected  but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly.  the iaaf s timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions   said ioannidis.  the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements  testimonies  the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes.   we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth.  kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer s olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august. the pair then spent four days in a hospital  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair. thanou and kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident
politics,parties warned over  grey vote  political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election  says age concern.  a survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. charity boss gordon lishman said if a  decisive blow  was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. a total of 3 028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.  he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to  support us all in an ageing society .  older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives   mr lishman said.  political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote.  in the survey carried out by icm research  14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. among the over-65s  70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election  compared with 39% of people under 55. age concern says the over-55s are  united around  key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. for 57%  pensions and the nhs were key issues  while the economy was important for a third  and tax was a crucial area for 25%.  the report was welcomed by conservative shadow pensions secretary david willetts.  the pensioners  voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into blair s cool britannia   he said.  labour s continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government.  he pointed to tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing  strengthen company pensions and encourage savings. a liberal democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously. he highlighted the party s promises to raise the basic state pension  provide free long-term care for the elderly and replace council tax  seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes. labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to incapacity benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.
sport,scotland 18-10 italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield.  coach matt williams  side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy  chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.  a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt  missed by full-back roland de marigny  and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy  after coming up yards short of the line  equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.  as the half wore on  both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties  and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically  if not psychologically  on top. italy s de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes. williams  side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and  after a couple of probing attacks  paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.  with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland  lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan s men had the last laugh when gordon ross  attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try  converted by de marigny.  : c paterson; s webster  a craig  h southwell  s lamont; d parks  c cusiter; t smith  g bulloch (capt)  g kerr; s grimes  s murray; s taylor  j petrie  a hogg.  r russell  b douglas  n hines  j dunbar  m blair  g ross  b hinshelwood.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  c stoica  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni; s dellape  m bortolami (capt); a persico  d dal maso  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  s orlando  p griffen  r pedrazzi  kp robertson.
politics,child access law shake-up planned parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.  curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied  lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers  activists had forced the changes  telling the bbc  there is a recognition that something is wrong . between 15 000 and 20 000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year  although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation  saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include:  - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements  based on real-life examples that have worked in the past   - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases   - better access to legal  emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet   - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.  judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a  nuclear option  which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests  a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a  medium range  of penalties  such as fines  community service orders  compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents  lord falconer said:  tagging may be going too far  but let s have a debate about that.  full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published  in the next two weeks   a spokesman said.  the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers  rights groups. john ison  from the controversial group fathers 4 justice  said:  it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.  jim parton  from families need fathers  said the new proposals  lacked compulsion .   we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand  you know what the minimum access is.  otherwise  you see people make agreements which then fall apart.  mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election  which is likely to take place in may.  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may  shadow secretary for the family  told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the government s plans were  inadequate  and were  papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a  radical reform  of the family courts  as well as enforcing a  legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation .  we want to make courts the last resort  rather than the first resort   she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up  like property  when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules  rather than having  rigid targets .
sport,wales want rugby league training wales could follow england s lead by training with a rugby league club.  england have already had a three-day session with leeds rhinos  and wales are thought to be interested in a similar clinic with rivals st helens. saints coach ian millward has given his approval  but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season. saints have a week s training in portugal next week  while wales will play england in the opening six nations match on 5 february.  we have had an approach from wales   confirmed a saints spokesman.  it s in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to.  st helens  who are proud of their welsh connections  are obvious partners for the welsh rugby union  despite a spat in 2001 over the collapse of kieron cunningham s proposed £500 000 move to union side swansea. a similar cross-code deal that took iestyn harris from leeds to cardiff in 2001 did go through  before the talented stand-off returned to the 13-man code with bradford bulls. kel coslett  who famously moved from wales to league in the 1960s  is currently saints  football manager  while clive griffiths - wales  defensive coach - is a former st helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative. scott gibbs  the former wales and lions centre  played for st helens from 1994-96 and was in the challenge cup-winning team at wembley in 1996.
sport,mourinho plots impressive course chelsea s win at fulham - confirming their position at the premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.  they have got strength in depth  great players  an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. all they need to add now is the big prizes which  as we all know  is the most difficult part of all. one thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge  won at newcastle in the carling cup  and then won 4-1 at fulham  which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. as i said  winning the major honours is the hardest task of all  but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all  the champions league  and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. it is a priceless commodity. no-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by mourinho. he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people  and maybe he can appear that way  but he has the silverware to back up the talk. mourinho doesn t simply talk a good game - he s won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto. some may criticise his talk  but the words are backed up with actions. i ve also found him to be very realistic whenever i ve heard him. he s spent a lot of money and it seems to be working  and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. the buys are now integrating  and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.  in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics  and yet he was winning games. you cannot win titles early on in the season  but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. i also thought the criticism was very harsh  because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. now they are taking those chances  have the double threat of robben and damien duff  and things are looking good. i just wonder if they lack a predator  particularly with didier drogba injured. he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined  but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league. i felt they would never have a better chance than last season  but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season. it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things  but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea s squad. i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season  even when arsenal were flying at the start  and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind.  if anything  what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions. and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal s rocky defensive display at spurs  even though they ran out 5-4 winners. mourinho had his say on that game  complaining:  five-four is a hockey score  not a football score.  in a three-against-three training match  if the score reaches 5-4 i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly.  so to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.   on a more serious note  it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal. much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan  but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal s defence. confidence is a crucial factor in defending. when you start conceding goals  you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. you think  oh no  - then find your worst fears confirmed. arsenal need to reverse the process  with or without campbell  and get some clean sheets on the board. but the return of campbell is key. he solidifies the unit  has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. chelsea have no such problems at present  which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season.
sport,fear will help france - laporte france coach bernard laporte believes his team will be scared going into their game with england on sunday  but claims it will work in their favour.  the french turned in a stuttering performance as they limped to a 16-9 win against scotland in the opening match of the six nations on saturday.  we will go to twickenham with a little fear and it ll give us a boost   said the french coach. he added:  we are never good enough when we are favourites.  meanwhile  perpignan centre jean-philippe granclaude is delighted to have received his first call-up to the france squad.  it s incredible   the youngster said.  i was not expecting it at all.  playing with the france team has always been a dream and now it has come true and i am about to face england at twickenham in the six nations.  laporte will announce his starting line-up on wednesday at the french team s training centre in marcoussis  near paris.
sport,martinez sees off vinci challenge veteran spaniard conchita martinez came from a set down to beat italian roberta vinci at the qatar open in doha.  the 1994 wimbledon champion won 5-7 6-0 6-2 to earn a second round meeting with french open champion anastasia myskina. fifth seed patty schnyder also had a battle as she needed three sets to beat china s na li 7-5 3-6 7-5. slovakian daniela hantuchova beat bulgarian magdaleena maleeva 4-6 6-4 6-3 to set up a second round clash with russian elena bovina. the veteran martinez found herself in trouble early on against vinci with the italian clinching the set thanks to breaks in the third and 11th games. but vinci s game fell to pieces after that and martinez swept her aside with some crisp cross-court returns and deft volleys. in the day s other matches  japan s ai sugiyama defeated australian samantha stosur 6-2 6-3 while australian nicole pratt beat tunisian selima sfar 7-5 6-2 and will next face compatriot alicia molik.
politics,blair hails turkey-eu talks deal tony blair has hailed a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership as important for the world s future  peace and prosperity .  mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. leaving a brussels summit mr blair said  the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred . the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership.  if it joins  turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. mr blair said having turkey in the eu was of  importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country  britain  and the wider world .   we are stating a fundamental principle that the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred from europe.  on the contrary  if it fulfils the same principles of human rights  then muslim and christian can work together.  under the agreement  turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the greek cypriot government  but gives turkey more time to sell the idea to its people.  the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member  but turkey  which occupies northern cyprus  had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country  calling the issue a  red line . it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join  and entry cannot be guaranteed. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however  talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.

politics,police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs  bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently  police chiefs have told mps.  association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics  calls for the law change to be delayed. instead  the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned  he argued.  acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting  mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.  if it s 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway.   this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions.  under acpo s proposal  the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.  mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself.  it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse  and the strategic planning process has been less than useless   he said. mr fox said the new laws  due to start being phased in next month  could help if food outlets  public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.  staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there  if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street   he said.  we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this.   acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps  councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. it was the status quo  not the new laws  which were causing current binge drinking problems  she told bbc two s newsnight. leaked documents have suggested ex-home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a  leap in the dark . but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met. the police s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time  she added.
sport,double injury blow strikes wales wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday s game with italy because of injury.  parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england  and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre. jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against england and joins flanker colin charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. meanwhile  mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first-choice kicker in rome. the centre was wales  hero in the 11-9 six nations win over england  landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. first-choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson s greater kicking range  but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal.  our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team  but giving him the kicks is something we ll talk about in selection this week   wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales. henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturday s game.  i thrive on it and think it makes me perform better   he said.  i m glad it s a short week before the italy game. there was so much build-up before england  but we fly out to rome on thursday and we ll be back playing again.
politics,new ukip defection to  veritas  the uk independence party has lost one of its two london assembly members to robert kilroy-silk s new political party  expected to launch on wednesday.  damian hockney said ex-chatshow host mr kilroy-silk would  deliver better  as the leader of a eurosceptic party. he said mr kilroy-silk had made him deputy party leader of veritas  latin for truth. sources close to mr hockney said around eight other members of london ukip were also planning to jump ship.  details of the coming week s events were hammered out at a meeting at mr kilroy-silk s buckinghamshire home on sunday  the bbc news website was told. the news came after ukip suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. ukip asserts that mr hockney  has a moral obligation  if not a legal one  to stand down. mr hockney meanwhile told the bbc:  i believe that robert kilroy-silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the uk independence party.   on the suspension of mr houston  ukip said those who selected him knew nothing of his views. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade.  the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  ukip spokesman mark croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not.
politics,tutu s guantanamo release call archbishop desmond tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at guantanamo bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the uk.  his comments follow news that all four britons held by the us in the cuban camp will be freed within weeks. the south african archbishop said detentions without trial were  unacceptable  and  distressing . twelve foreign nationals are being held indefinitely without trial in the uk under anti-terror laws. referring to the detentions in cuba  archbishop tutu told bbc news:  it is utterly unacceptable.  the rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don t use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty.   moazzam begg  from birmingham  and martin mubanga  richard belmar and feroz abbasi  from london  have been held by the us at guantanamo bay for almost three years. on tuesday foreign secretary jack straw told the commons that the us had agreed to release the four after  intensive and complex discussions  over security. the britons were detained as part of the us-led  war on terror . the archbishop added:  whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released  what is happening to those left behind   we in south africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.   now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to britain and the united states. it is so  so deeply distressing.  following mr straw s announcement  lawyer louise christian  who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga  said the government should have acted sooner. foreign nationals detained in the uk are being held at belmarsh and woodhill prisons. in december the house of lords  the uk s highest court  ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws. but the men are still behind bars.  archbishop tutu criticised the measures  saying:  i am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening  even in britain.  shami chakrabarti  director of civil rights group liberty  has called on the government to  practise what it preaches  and either free or charge the detained men. but the home office defended the measures. a spokesman said:  these individuals cannot currently be prosecuted because some evidence  such as that provided by third parties  cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk.  it is also currently the case that intelligence gained from covert intercepts cannot be used in a court of law.
sport,federer joins all-time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis  and one country dominate the women s game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open  two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile  briton tim henman enjoyed his best year  while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles  and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon  and federer s performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final  an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open  and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games  which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup  which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay  losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton s defeat  but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year  returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168  many feared the 31-year-old s career was over  but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004  with myskina  maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams  before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up  it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay  a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo  whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne s year  although she was fit enough to win olympic gold  but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt  and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence  myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic  but woeful  all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19  showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but  hampered by injury  lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing  with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving  the likes of henin-hardenne  clijsters  davenport  mauresmo  venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men s side.
politics,blunkett unveils policing plans people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett.  the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. local people would also be able to  trigger  action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous  would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources.  mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms  he said  but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. the home secretary s powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunkett s battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley.  opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were  little more than a taxpayer-funded pr exercise  ahead of a general election predicted for next may.  police forces were already  buried  under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them   said mr davis. earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.  but these measures will only work if they re matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets.   before delivering a statement to mps  mr blunkett was joined by tony blair at welling school  in south east london  which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. mr blunkett said he wanted  to go back to a time when i was very young  when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work . the prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and  not the minority who want to cause trouble .  mr blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. he has also started to recruit 25 000 community support officers (csos) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. an extra £50m was promised on tuesday so 2 000 new csos can be recruited now rather than next year. within two years  every force will be expected to keep to a  coppers  contract  on what kind of service the public can expect. a mori poll this summer suggested policing  unlike health and education  was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. the plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. there will also be  specific exercises  to encourage black and asian people to join the police at senior ranks.
sport,radcliffe enjoys winning comeback paula radcliffe made a triumphant return to competitive running with victory in the new york marathon.  the briton  running for the first time since dropping out of the olympic marathon and 10 000m  held off kenyan susan chepkemei in a thrilling finish. the pair were locked together for the last few miles before radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours  23 minutes and 10 seconds.  it s a good way to end the year   she said.  i m ready for a good rest now.  radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. but the world record-holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace. just chepkemei and radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles. the kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off radcliffe but the briton managed to hang in. both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in central park. but it was radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off chepkemei in the closest finish in the race s history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in athens.
politics,act on detention ruling  uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords  ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful  mary robinson has said.  the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4 s today the government s response would be scrutinised internationally.  it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it   she said. home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation  mr clarke said:  i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.  in the meantime  we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.   mrs robinson said the law lords  ruling was  in line with international legal opinion  and praised their  very decisive  eight to one majority.  what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government  but say that there had been a disproportionate use  that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn t apply to british citizens   she said.  mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg.  if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress  including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords.  she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications.  i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at  both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles  but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there.   the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions  in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.
sport,gatlin and hayes win owen awards american olympic stars justin gatlin and joanna hayes have been named the winners of the 2004 jesse owens awards  usa track & field s (usatf) top honour.  gatlin  22  won the closest 100m final in games history with a career-best time of 9.85 seconds in athens. he also won bronze in the 200m and silver in the 4x100m relay  becoming the only male athlete to win three athletics medals this summer. hayes  27  set an olympic record of 12.37 in winning the 100m hurdles. established in 1981  the jesse owens awards - named in honour of the late olympic great who won four gold medals at the 1936 berlin games - are presented annually to the outstanding us male and female track and field performers.  the 2004 awards will be presented on 3 december in conjunction with the usatf annual meeting in portland.  it is such a great honour to win the jesse owens award   said gatlin.  it is one of the biggest honours in track and field and it is a great end to a great year.   hayes said:  knowing some of the great people who have won this award before me and knowing what it represents  i feel a sense accomplishment and pride which lets me know that everything that i have worked for is and always will be worth it.
sport,jones medals  must go if guilty  world anti-doping agency (wada) chief dick pound says marion jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.  victor conte  of balco laboratories  claims the american sprinter regularly used drugs to enhance her performance.  if she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years   said pound. asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken  pound said:  that is not an issue at all.  however  under international olympic committee (ioc) rules  athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event. jones  who won five medals at the 2000 olympics  denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over conte s allegations. balco laboratories is the firm at the centre of a wide-reaching investigation into doping in the us. pound continued:  if she has indeed taken drugs it is going to be a big disappointment for a lot of people.
politics,lib dems target the student vote students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election  liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed.  the party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. the figures assume all students will vote in their university town. in fact  some may vote where the parents live. the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people s ambitions.  the lib dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the lib dems from second place to beat labour  and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the tories. launching his campaign to win students  votes at the london school of economics  mr kennedy urged students to  make their mark . he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to £2 000. he said:  top-up fees put students off university  especially those from a poorer background.  and is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks   mr kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the iraq war  which his party opposed  as a defining issue.  labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3 000 a year  with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3 000. ahead of mr kennedy s launch  a labour spokesperson said:  like the tories  the liberal democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration  closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions.  they are committed to abandoning labour s targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under lib dem plans students would even have to study near home.  the conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.  they say the lib dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the  goodwill  of the chancellor.  shadow education secretary tim collins is on thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for 14 to 16-year-olds to tackle what he says are  crippling skills shortages . the lib dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university  not in their home towns. although the expected 5 may election would be during term time  students can vote by post. the electoral commission and national union of students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. if the election is on 5 may  voters need to register by 11 march.    - the seats where the lib dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: bristol west  cardiff central  leeds north west  cambridge  manchester gorton  sheffield central  oxford east  newcastle-upon-tyne central  liverpool riverside  holborn and st pancras  oldham east and saddleworth  manchester withington  islington south and finsbury  birmingham yardley  surrey south west  taunton  orpington  haltemprice and howden  eastbourne  isle of wight  dorset west  bournemouth east  wells  canterbury  cities of london and westminster  bournemouth west  westmorland and lonsdale.
sport,a november to remember last saturday  one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world.  that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level  at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion  with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand.  clearly  there is no number one side in the world at the moment   declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney.  there are four  five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.   while that bodes well for rugby as a whole  it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies  all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year  europe s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade  it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.  that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.    who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season  could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland  before england and france come to lansdowne road.  their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self-belief  while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games. not that england or france  who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them  will lay down quietly.  dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio  they still have the personnel to prosper.  the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden  but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident  and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff  a fourth title in six years is within reach.  are in familiar revival territory  but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.  while south africa s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected  wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack  there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left  in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina  their first loss since the world cup  could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency.  but the manner of new zealand s 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french  the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining  in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia  the scots  humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations  a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.    who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland  are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime  the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.
sport,dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.  even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue  just four days before the start of the season. but then dallaglio has always been his own man. ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions. to supporters of england  dallaglio could do no wrong. an integral part of a sustained period of success for england  dallaglio s crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003.  rival fans  meanwhile  have tended to take an alternative view  seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. never afraid to speak his mind  be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch  or his coach or the media off it  dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993. it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv  but once there he proved to the manor born. displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years  dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.  within two years of his debut  dallaglio was offered the england captain s band  and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa. although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson  he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum  dallaglio s career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.  first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio s decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy. with sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages  a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper. but he bounced back  getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold  albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson. as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned - dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.  yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio s involvement on the lions tour to australia.  rumours began to circulate that his career was over but  in typical dallaglio style  he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace  but ever the pragmatist  he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.  the only player to play every minute of england s world cup triumph in australia  dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england s historic win  and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. following johnson s retirement  dallaglio s career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio s second spell as captain  losing five of their eight post-world cup tests  dallaglio led by example  leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england s most accomplished players  if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.  the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. the likes of matt dawson  jonny wilkinson  phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio s role as captain. but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up  the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio s massive influence on english rugby.
sport,robinson wants dual code success england rugby union captain jason robinson has targeted dual code success over australia on saturday.  robinson  a former rugby league international before switching codes in 2000  leads england against australia at twickenham at 1430 gmt. and at 1815 gmt  great britain s rugby league team take on australia in the final of the tri-nations tournament.  beating the aussies in both games would be a massive achievement  especially for league   said robinson. england have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over canada and south africa  as well as gaining revenge for june s 51-15 hammering by the wallabies. meanwhile  great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road. britain have won individual test matches  but have failed to secure any silverware or win the ashes (with a series victory) since 1970.   they have a great opportunity to land a trophy and it would be a massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won   said robinson.  i know the boys can do it - they ve defeated the aussies once already in the tri-nations.  but robinson was not losing sight of the task facing his england side in their final autumn international.  for us  we ve played two and won two this november   he said.  if we beat australia it would be the end to a great autumn series for england. if we stumble then we ll be looking back with a few regrets. robinson also revealed that the union side had sent the great britain team a good luck message ahead of the showdown in leeds.  we signed a card for them today and will write them an email on saturday wishing them all the best   said robinson.  everyone has signed the card - a lot of the guys watch league and we support them fully.  both games will be very tough and hopefully we ll both do well.
sport,stam spices up man utd encounter ac milan defender jaap stam says manchester united  know they made a mistake  by selling him in 2001.  the sides meet at old trafford in the champions league game on wednesday and the 32-year-old s dutchman s presence is sure to add spice to the fixture.  united made a mistake in selling me   stam told uefa s champions magazine.  i was settled at manchester united  but they wanted to sell me. if a club want to sell you  there is nothing you can do. you can be sold like cattle.  sir alex ferguson surprised the football world - and stam - by selling the dutchman to lazio for £16.5m in august 2001. the decision came shortly after stam claimed in his autobiography that ferguson had tapped him up when he was at psv eindhoven. but ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. the affair still rankles with the dutchman.   i was settled at manchester united  i had even just ordered a new kitchen  but they wanted to sell me   he said.  in what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes   of course  you can refuse to go  but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. i don t agree that players control the game.  there have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers  but i have turned them down. what s the point    wednesday s game at old trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between united s young attackers wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo and milan s veteran defence of stam  paolo maldini  cafu and alessandro costacurta. stam says rooney s teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game.  we can t all be wayne rooneys - at his age i was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone   he said.  starting late can be a good thing. some kids who start early get bored.  i had my youth - having fun  drinking beers  blowing up milk cannisters. it sounds strange but it s a tradition where i grew up in kampen - and i had done all the things i wanted to do.

sport,man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals.  rooney received a hostile reception  but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes  free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll  who was later struck by a missile  saved at his feet.  rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint  and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes  rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances  and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent  played onside by gabriel heintze  hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert  but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through  but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes  free-kick took a deflection  and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo  who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs  but once again martyn denied the england striker.  - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson:  it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out.  the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in.  i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again  he s truly a fabulous player.  everton: martyn  hibbert  yobo  stubbs  naysmith  osman  carsley  arteta  kilbane  mcfadden  bent. subs: wright  pistone  weir  plessis  vaughan. manchester united: carroll  gary neville  brown  ferdinand  heinze  ronaldo  phil neville  keane  scholes  fortune  rooney. subs: howard  giggs  smith  miller  spector. referee: r styles (hampshire)
sport,mcclaren hails boro s uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the 2-0 uefa cup win against lazio.  boro  who are playing in europe for the first time in their 128-year history  are top of group e with maximum points.  i think we have taken to europe really well   said mcclaren.  we got about lazio  didn t let them settle or play. and in possession  we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward.  before the match  mcclaren had said that a win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map. and after they did just that he said:  it was a perfect european night. for the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake.  there have been many good performances but this was something special.   you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing. to win in europe you need to defend well  and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games.  we can also score goals  and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had  so we have good balance. mcclaren s only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals.  it should have been more convincing   said mcclaren.  but i had watched lazio in recent weeks and i saw them score a late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so i knew we needed a second goal.   no matter what anybody says  lazio are favourites to win this competition.  middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals.  we didn t expect it to be that one-sided   said zenden.  we did quite well in the first half  we pressured them and they didn t cope with that.  i think we played quite well and it was a very good game  especially in the first half.  the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games.  we ve got a very good feeling  there is a good spirit  all the lads work hard for each other and it s a squad of friendly players  which i think you can see on the pitch   he added.
politics,russian ex-spy on hunger strike an ex-russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for mi6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 downing street.  viktor makarov  50  claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities  who promised he would live like an  average british citizen . but despite a £65 000 settlement four years ago  he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. other ex-russian spies have been given civil service pensions.  hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. it can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work   mr makarov told the bbc s newsnight programme.  since i came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.   oleg gordievsky  a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british  said he was  very happy  with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. commenting on mr makarov s case  he said:  the british state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week.  but mr makarov s case has been backed by david kahn - a former yale historian  and a leading expert on code-breaking  who has confirmed his information was valuable to the western allies.  i believe the government of the united kingdom  which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that victor makarov had  wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold   mr kahn said.  mr makarov joined the kgb in 1970s russia  as an idealistic 20 year-old. one of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was vladimir putin. at kgb headquarters in moscow  he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the west. by the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of western powers. but he had became deeply disenchanted with the soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in poland.  through his english teacher  he made an approach to m16 - and then began passing secrets to the british intelligence service. he spied for mi6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to perm 35 - a soviet hard labour camp in the artic circle. within a week of his release in 1992  he made contact with the british authorities he d been spying for  who arranged a meeting between him and an mi6 agent in latvia. he was given a false passport  and he says  promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average uk citizen. but after arriving in london 13 years ago  he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. after long periods of living in bedsits  with deteriorating health  four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for £65 000 to buy a small house. but he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work  something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. government sources told the bbc they had reached a final settlement with the former spy  which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.
sport,anelka  eyes man city departure  striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football.  anelka  25  is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club. the news of the world reports that anelka told a french magazine:  i either decide to win titles or to have an easy life.  i think i will always choose football  if a great club makes me an offer.  he added:  to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. if we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it s impossible to progress.  if i am going to score goals and not win  there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up.  anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal  real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.   i am in talks to sign an extension to my contract   he said.  i am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account.  playing for eighth place is good but i miss the champions league.  i won it with real madrid in 2000 and i need to be playing in it - and i should be playing in it.  i m not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football.  but i don t blame anyone. it s a bit my fault.
politics,galloway targets  new labour  mp george galloway is to stand against pro-iraq war labour mp oona king at the next general election.  mr galloway  who on thursday won £150 000 in libel damages from the daily telegraph said he would contest bethnal green  in london  for respect. the glasgow kelvin mp  who was expelled from labour over his anti iraq war stance  accused ms king of being a  new labour stooge . ms king said she was  delighted  at the chance to take on mr galloway.  mr galloway s current constituency is set to disappear under planned boundary changes in scotland.  the 50-year-old mp launched respect  the unity coalition  in january along with 1 000 anti-war activists  and the muslim association of britain. the party s declared aims are an end to the occupation of iraq  the repeal of anti-union laws and the end of privatisation. speaking from a cafe in brick lane  east london  mr galloway said he had accepted the party s invitation to stand with  great honour and pride .  he added:  here in this constituency of bethnal green and bow there is a new labour stooge mp.  a stooge who will sing any song  make any speech  do any dance  do anything she is told to by tony blair - irrespective of how her constituents are adversely affected or how strongly they feel to the contrary.  ms king has represented the constituency since 1997. she said:  i m delighted i ve been given the chance to finish him (mr galloway) off  and believe me i will.  i know many people around the country will be grateful  not least his constituents in scotland who he has shamelessly abandoned.  in june s european parliament elections  respect failed to gain enough votes for an mep but did come first in tower hamlets borough  most of which is covered by the commons constituency of bethnal green and bow.  a month later it gained a council seat in a by-election in st dunstan s and stepney green ward  tower hamlets. mr galloway said that in next year s expected general election and local elections a year later  the party would  turn the east end of london into a fortress . both the conservatives and the liberal democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for bethnal green and bow from the bangladeshi population  which makes up almost half the electorate. the telegraph was sued for libel by mr galloway after the newspaper claimed he received money from saddam hussein s regime in iraq. the newspaper said it was in the public interest to publish the claims  based on documents found in baghdad. mr justice eady said he was  obliged to compensate mr galloway... and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation .
politics,mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system  mps have said.  the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort  but where they are  their orders should be enforced more rigorously  mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.  currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount.  an arbitrary  template  imposed on all families  whatever the needs of the child  would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position   the mps said.  they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would  reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children  as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents  while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety   they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed  a new  status quo  arrangement for the children to become established by default   they said.   although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias  there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present.  given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases  we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents.  committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a  complex and emotive  one.  at the moment  far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation   he said.  this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort  where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with.  this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.
politics,blair looks to election campaign tony blair s big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.  that poll may still be about 16 weeks away  but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing. the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. there was a detailed account of the government s past record  with a major emphasis on the economy and public services. there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown. and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly  new  labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.  there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges  although the prime minister talked about a  new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society . his was more a speech designed to remind people  and some in his own party  precisely what new labour stood for  and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. and  for some  that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something - that it is  as he said  more than  an electoral device .  to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it  possibly through some gritted teeth  in 2001  and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters. in a key section  he declared:  in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity.  for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood.  every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance.  home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it.  the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions .  under what is to be the general election slogan  britain is working   the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour. that might get under the skin of mr brown  but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor britain has had. probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men  in so far as there is one  is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.  an unremittingly  new  labour manifesto  as the prime minister is happy to make plain  will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents  for example  want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance  although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle. with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and  in particular  the use of that little three letter word. but for now  all eyes have been focused on the next general election. and for many in westminster  mr blair s performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 may.
politics,will tory tax cuts lift spirits  michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts.  should he win the next general election  he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters  he believes  will warm to. at its simplest  it is saying:  vote tory and you can have it both ways . not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services  including health and education  it would increase spending on defence  police and pensions. and even after that was done  it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy  waste and the civil service. of that  £23 billion would go on spending plans  with £8 billion to fill the black hole left  they claim  by gordon brown  and the rest going in tax cuts.  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash  although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax  although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. as the tory leader declared  the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories.  at this election  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less   he said.  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts.  the extension of that  however  was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters. and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes  he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street. labour  needless to say  claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply don t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.  one of new labour s greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters  business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy. so far that has not faced any real challenge  but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. meanwhile  the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. so  mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. and  while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign  it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.
sport,o connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul o connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer.  o connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job  but says he is totally focused on sunday s six nations crunch clash with england.  i honestly don t think about these reports   he told bbc sport.  the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk  nothing more. i just ignore it and get on with my job.  he added:  the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think.  i can just imagine them saying  i m going to show this guy what s what about second row play . that s the one thing that makes me cringe.  o connell  who made a try-scoring international debut against wales two years ago  is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby s shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the lions.   i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times  but not for very long  certainly nothing about summer holidays   he joked. he also said he remains wary of wounded england s abilities coming into sunday s game after two straight defeats  dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory.  it s very dangerous to think that. this england team has so much experience and skill. you do not become a bad team overnight.  they have two world class game-breakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson  while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place.  he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being over-confident.  that s not going to happen in our squad. no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap   he said.  every time we play england we know what a big task it is. look at what they did to us two years ago. i remember that game all too well  and it was not a good feeling.  i came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6  and ended up getting hammered 42-6  so i know what can happen when england come to dublin.  they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well.
politics,no to royal succession shake-up a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males.  the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown. it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. but the government refused to back lord dubs  succession to the crown bill  saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.  the lord chancellor  lord falconer  agreed the 1701 act of settlement  which governs the succession  was discriminatory but added that  for all practical purposes its effects are limited .  the changes proposed by lord dubs were a  complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues   he said. lord falconer said there were 22 members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act.  it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn t the proper form   he added.  he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs  private member s bill was passed by peers  he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons. lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords  but urged the government to think again at a later stage.  we cannot forever say we don t want to change things because it is too difficult   he told peers. during the debate  the labour peer and former minister said:  the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country.  what we don t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times.  we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics.  but opponents of the bill  including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester  the rt rev michael scott-joynt  said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith. such a  secular  state would be markedly  less tolerant   rt rev scott-joynt argued.
sport,sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland.  sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date. but he told bbc sport:  michalak is the answer both now and for the future. delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak.  he does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset ireland.  the 22-year-old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season. with michalak overlooked  the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales.  the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half-time   said sella.   their only mistakes were that they didn t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.  sella  however  insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire laporte  despite the defeat at the stade de france.  this season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 world cup   said sella   which laporte is doing very well. the french get better every game.  it s difficult  though  when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel.  but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory.  as a result  it is important that people give him time. it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions.   the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales  he said  the win was most important .  winning is all that matters   he added.  ok  the flair may not have been so good  but the discipline  organisation and defence was there  which are all important ahead of 2007.  france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday 12 march. the french go into the game as clear underdogs. but sella added:  people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that.  but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. it s going to be tough.

sport,campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal a hard-fought win at portsmouth.  the england defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot  five points behind chelsea. but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller. in the first half he blasted wide when clear  and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages. but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle. with just fuller as an out-and-out striker  portsmouth s shape made life difficult for arsenal. but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal  although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown.  ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and  as arsenal began to press  van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up. henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block  and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared. after playing second fiddle  portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o neil away but  having shrugged off toure  the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. as half-time approached  henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. at the other end  fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down.  fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger s break and slipped pass played him clear. but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira s challenge  referee webb was not interested. fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu  who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie s shot as henry sniffed for scraps.  portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger. arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell. the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown. arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry s free-kick. almunia went full length to grab berger s long-range shot  while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp s shot.  ashdown  griffin  de zeeuw  primus  taylor  stone  o neil  faye (berkovic 83)  berger  lualua  fuller (yakubu 55).  subs not used: hislop  quashie  cisse.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  vieira  clichy  van persie (bergkamp 68)  henry.  subs not used: lehmann  fabregas  senderos  hoyte.  cole.  campbell 75.  20 170.  h webb (s yorkshire).
politics,new rules tackle  sham weddings  new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force.  from tuesday  most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages  of which there are estimated to be up to 15 000 a year. but immigrants  group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year  immigration minister des browne said:  our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages  while providing firm controls to prevent abuse.  under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.  but from tuesday all non-eu nationals  apart from citizens of switzerland  liechtenstein  iceland or norway  intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office  certificate of marriage approval . to get a certificate  costing £135  applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk. those without a settled status  such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application  will have no right to marry in the uk.  once they have the necessary documentation  those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. they can  however  marry at the register office or church of their choice. rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were  not proportionate  and  discriminatory .   these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.  we re currently taking a legal opinion on this. we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court   ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a  significant risk  the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were  disproportionate . the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion  belief and nationality  the report added.  over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. and last november samuel amoah  a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk  was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office  has been key in many prosecutions. registrars  spokesman  mark rimmer  said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.  they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country  of which we had quite a few  will no longer be getting married   mr rimmer said. mr rimmer  the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london  said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.  it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it s still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry  for example  in holland  germany or france.  i think it s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem   mr rimmer said.
sport,england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his side s six nations defeat to ireland.  the rugby football union (rfu) will investigate robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against kaplan. robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the international rugby board. robinson had said he was  livid  about kaplan s decisions on saturday to disallow two england  tries.  the england coach went on to claim that  only one side was refereed .  after reviewing tapes of the match  the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplan s refereeing. instead the rfu said in a statement they would   set out any concerns the england team management may have in a confidential manner .  an irb spokesman said on the matter:  we take all breaches of the code very seriously.  should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction  as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made  it would be the end of the matter.   kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england s 19-13 defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was  very disappointed  with robinson s remarks. and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotland s match against wales on 13 march.  the rfu recently fined northampton coach budge pountney £2 000 and imposed a six-week ban for his criticism of referee steve lander after a premiership match.
sport,johnson uncertain about euro bid jade johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month s european indoor championships in madrid despite winning the aaas long jump title on saturday.  the 24-year-old delivered a personal best of 6.50m to win the european trials but had to wait until her final jump after four failures.  i don t want to go if i am not going to get a medal   said johnson.  i will have to see how i am jumping in the next competition and i ll have to have a conversation with my coach.  johnson  who finished seventh in last year s olympic games  has not competed indoors since 2000. and the commonwealth and european silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence.  it s the stress   said johnson.  i am not used to feeling this  this early. i am just used to training.  but if i m doing this kind of thing  then i will have to see how it goes.  johnson next competes in the high-class birmingham grand prix on 18 february.
politics,uk troops on ivory coast standby downing street has confirmed british troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred uk citizens from ivory coast.  the news came as it emerged france had begun evacuating its hostages after days of anti-french demonstrations. trouble flared after nine french peacekeepers were killed and president jacques chirac ordered the destruction of the ivory coast s air force. a company of 100-120 uk troops is understood to have been put on standby. they are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. prime minister tony blair s official spokesman said:  there are british nationals in ivory coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further  but that s all i can say at this stage.   he added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. france has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in ivory coast - a former colony - after president laurent gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine french soldiers. the decision to destroy the african nation s small air force prompted riots against french and other foreign nationals. the spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.
politics,blair joins school sailing trip the prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his party s education policies.  tony blair sailed across the lake in bromsgrove  worcestershire  while on a visit with education secretary ruth kelly to back school outings. mr blair later stressed labour s election pledge to focus on education  when he met parents in the area. the conservatives and lib dems both say his pledges are  worthless . all the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a general election widely expected to be held on 5 may. mr blair  looking a little windswept  joined two girls from st egwin s middle school in evesham and an instructor for a trip in the wayfarer dinghy  closely followed by a boat full of photographers.  afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong.  what we re doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action   mr blair said.  when you are doing these types of activities you ve got to exercise some common sense there obviously.  you can t have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they re going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character.   the pledge on education -  your child achieving more  - was one of six election pledges unveiled by mr blair last week. if it wins a third term in the general election expected this year  labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools; allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status; opening 200 city academies and creating 100 000 more sixth-form places. it aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a  zero tolerance  approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants. labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils.  parents and teachers who met mr blair on tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their mps to raise concerns about education. it is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run-up to the election - and that he has not lost touch. for the conservatives  shadow education secretary tim collins said:  mr blair&#191;s government is all talk. he must be judged on what he has done in two terms  not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third. that judgment will be damning.  the liberal democrats are promising to cut class sizes for the youngest children and ensure all children are taught by a qualified teacher in each subject.
sport,jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte  whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation  made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday  conte said:  i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit  filed in the us district court in san francisco  said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she  has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements  the suit added  were  false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month  jones  lawyer richard nicholls said:  marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never  ever used performance-enhancing drugs.  victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment  while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory.  mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television  while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.   mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed.  the sport s ruling body  the iaaf  is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte  for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.  if it is felt there is case to answer  it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action   he added.  the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war.  and i am sure  like ourselves  they will be watching the television programme with great interest.  jones  who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency  has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal  although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones  who did not win any medals in athens in august  has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile  conte  who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering  is due to face trial in march.
politics,student  fee factor  played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.  however  lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by 17% between january 2005 and the previous year  up 23 600 to 27 700. fears had been expressed that a flood of  fee refugees  would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3 000 a year being introduced in england. in june last year  mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by £2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood  although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.  the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland  which represents university principals  claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director  david caldwell  said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities  but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme:  the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality  they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.   they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated.  however  it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here.  mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances  the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.  also  the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales  where there are no plans for top-up fees  have also risen  by 19%. mr wallace said:  accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held  not just in britain.  we want to make sure that when students are making their choice  they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland.  we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.  very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.
politics,lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products  the lib dems say.  vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. the lib dems  treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. he wants to see  proper health checks  when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.   were economic conditions to deteriorate at all  large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit   mr cable told bbc news.  banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead.  mr cable said the government s consumer credit bill would target some of the  extreme problems  such as loan sharking  but ministers had been  a bit complacent  about the wider issue of debt levels. he said much of the payment protection currently available was  extremely expensive  and there were  lots of exclusions .  mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market. lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the  real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats  where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives  and urban areas traditionally associated with labour. labour say a lib dem vote could  let the tories in   while the tories say the lib dems would mean  higher taxes  soft crime laws  more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he  labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election  widely expected to be held on 5 may.  the liberal democrats say in the northern cities  the race is between them and labour  while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday  mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in  recent experience . and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in  by the back door .  if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections  the liberal democrats have demonstrated that  not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position  but we can go on to defeat the government.  that s going to be the story  i think  of this coming general election.
politics,uk heading wrong way  says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.
politics,commons hunt protest charges eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.  the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. those charged included otis ferry  the 22-year-old son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson  27  a close friend of princes william and harry. they were charged under section 5 of the public order act  police said.  five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening  after the charges were formerly put to them. the men s solicitor matthew knight  said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.   there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons - it is not a criminal offence   he said.  if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so  but it can t do so retrospectively.  we are not prosecuted for that. we are prosecuted for a public order act offence. we are not guilty of it.  they will appear at bow street magistrates  court on 21 december  a police spokesman said. otis ferry  a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt  said:  i have no regrets.  we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country.  one of the men  david redvers  34  from hartpury  gloucestershire  said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.  the other protesters are john holliday  37  a huntsman from ledbury  herefordshire  robert thame  34  who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove  auctioneer andrew elliot  42  from bromesberrow  near ledbury  point-to-point jockey richard wakeham  34  from york  and former royal chef nick wood  41. the 15 september protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square. four of the men ran out from behind the speaker s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.  speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. in november  the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales. however  many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed  saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. last week  the countryside alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. the alliance said the 19 february meets would show the new law was  impossibly difficult to determine  and open to different interpretations.
politics,poll idols  face first hurdles vote for me - itv1 s pop idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.  over the next four days  hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election  which is expected in the spring. but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics.  any of them would make competent mps   former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr bell  who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday  argues that westminster has its share of  odd balls  and the show will engage ordinary voters.  if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that   he said. but sir bernard ingham  margaret thatcher s former press secretary  took a less charitable view  accusing the programme of  corrupting politics .  he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters  with that bunch of nutters . to give sir bernard his dues  monday evening s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star  who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth s birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format  with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.  the contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel  which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant  with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie  in the simon cowell  mr nasty seat.  the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to  get a haircut and a brain transplant . wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked:  why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled    don t you care about the inuit    implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim.  i don t care about them. i care about myself and when the sun s shining i think - fantastic   replied mr mackenzie.  mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.  when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown  he says well  prime minister  bad news  all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax   observed mr mackenzie.  that was an total disaster. i just couldn t seem to think of things to say   a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show s presenter  jonathan maitland. irfan hanif  a 25-year-old doctor from bolton  made a good impression  even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie s suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs  young drunks should  given a good beating  and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final 25  on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts  a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.  he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament.  but ms kelly said she  would not trust him as far as she could throw him . the series continues throughout the week  with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night. itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner  but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.
sport,prutton poised for lengthy fa ban southampton s david prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the football association.  the 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal. the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly  pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman. and the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.  paolo di canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in a premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in 1998. prutton will be joined at wednesday s hearing by saints boss harry redknapp  who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player. redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referee s assistant norman.  david has made a big mistake and he knows it. i can t condone what he s done. he was out of order but he knows that   said redknapp.  he s a decent lad. he over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. off the pitch you couldn t meet a nicer lad.  prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to arsenal s robert pires  who was injured in a wild tackle by the saints  midfield man.  he said:  it s an horrendous situation. i apologise to the ref and linesman  who were only doing their job.  i ve also seen what happened to pires  leg and i m sorry for that as well.   i apologise for the people who saw it. i know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don t pay money to see that sort of thing.  it s not a cop-out  but it was all a bit of a blur. sometimes you react and it s beyond your control    added prutton.
sport,what now for british tennis  tim henman s decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with a gargantuan void to fill.  the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). and great britain s last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as 1996. worse could follow  according to former british team member chris bailey. bailey told bbc sport:  after tim s announcement  i doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him.  but without their top two  where does that leave british ambitions in the sport s premier team event  captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements. the yugoslavian-born bogdanovic  though  is 184 places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.  murray  on the other hand  is 407th in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut. but bailey does see some hope for the future. he said:  now we ve dropped down to the euro-africa zone  the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.  britain s next opponents  israel  are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 march match against a likely trio of bogdanovic  murray and the 187th-ranked arvind parmar. bailey said:  it will be tough for gb to move up  but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. this was always going to be inevitable with tim and greg s growing years.  i m confident about the future. i wouldn t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year  but i d imagine in five years time we ll be competing for the major honours.  of those lining up to replace henman  the 17-year-old murray  with four futures titles under his belt last year  looks the best long-term bet.  murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tim s mantle   said bailey.  he has an enormous amount of self-confidence  judging by what he s said in the past.  bogdanovic  three years murray s senior  has had a more troubled time under britain s davis cup umbrella.  while murray has been marked out as britain s golden boy  bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. and bailey said:  despite that  alex is clearly talented as well  while arvind is another contender.  they re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines.  the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that.  now they ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. and i m confident that will springboard team gb to greater success.
politics,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time  tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.  this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives  particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference  which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists:  i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose.  and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job  and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.  so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt  he was asked  by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well  not really  as it happens.  and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were  before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers  preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared:  i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding:  in so far as i read them of course.  he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.  as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned  there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence  which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.  either way  the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly  the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.  then  as if to pour fuel on the flames  both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw  aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had  as a result  started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto  has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s  turf  - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well  repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that  unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry  it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.
politics,kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics - the real opposition  the valid opposition  the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they  not the tories  who are now the real threat to labour. as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign  the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a  fading  force. and he insisted there was  no limit  to his party s ambitions in the coming poll. and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq. he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election.  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow - as proved  he claimed  by the defection to labour of robert jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. on the war on iraq  identity cards  student fees and the council tax  there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed  sensible alternatives. he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100 000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees  the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to  prop up  either of the other big parties after the election.  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats. the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.  labour  in particular  fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats. but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. he will not talk about the big breakthrough  although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. they would argue that  by the time of the election after next  the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power. the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq. but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible  costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax  crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.

sport,parmar ruled out of davis cup tie a knee injury has forced arvind parmar out of great britain s davis cup tie in israel and left alex bogdanovic in line to take the second singles place.  parmar picked up the injury last week and has failed to recover in time for the europe/africa zone i tie  which begins in tel aviv on friday. bogdanovic looks set to take the second singles place alongside greg rusedski. gb captain jeremy bates could use 17-year-old andrew murray and david sherwood in the doubles rubber. bogdanovic and murray both pulled out of tournaments last week through injury but are expected to be fit. jamie delgado and lee childs have been called into the squad in tel aviv as designated hitters for team practice but bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.  the unheralded sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week  and bates said:  david has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months.  the 6ft 4in sherwood is ranked 264th in the world and the lta have high hopes for him after futures tournament wins in wrexham and edinburgh.  the sheffield-born right-hander  aged 24  also reached another final in plaisir  france  a week after making the semi-final in mulhouse. bates is glad to have rusedski available after tim henman s retirement from davis cup tennis.  his wealth of experience is invaluable  particularly to the younger players and i know he will lead by example   bates said.  we are looking forward to the tie. the squad are all in excellent form.
politics,tsunami debt deal to be announced chancellor gordon brown has said he hopes to announce a deal to suspend debt interest repayments by tsunami-hit nations later on friday.  the agreement by the g8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries £3bn pounds a year  he said. the deal is thought to have been hammered out on thursday night after japan  one of the biggest creditor nations  finally signed up to it. mr brown first proposed the idea earlier this week.  g8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the world bank and the international monetary fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster. mr brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the g8  which britain now chairs. germany also proposed a freeze and canada has begun its own moratorium. the expected deal comes as foreign secretary jack straw said the number of britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached 440.
sport,newcastle 27-27 gloucester newcastle centre mathew tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another  but he could not stop gloucester grabbing a draw.  the falcons were 22-6 down at the break before tait  recently axed by england after just one six nations outing  inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. a last-gasp touchdown from luke narraway pulled the visitors level. but gloucester missed out on victory when henry paul fluffed the conversion and seti kiole was denied a late try. newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. but they failed to make them count until joe shaw found dave walder  who released mark mayerholfer in his own 22.  the former all black broke clear and popped the ball up for tait on halfway. he chipped ahead for michael stephenson to scorch through for the try  which walder converted to give newcastle a lifeline. they grabbed it with both hands  mayerhofler breaking through and tait making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race 30m to score. walder converted to make it 22-20 before he was just wide with a 40m penalty in the 70th minute.  mayerhofler then scythed through the middle for a try after hall charlton popped the ball up  and walder s conversion took newcastle 27-22 ahead. with three minutes of normal time left  narraway was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27. henry missed the conversion but gloucester nearly won it when kiole broke through only to be hauled down by charlton and tom may.  walder; may  tait  mayerhofler  stephenson; wilkinson  grindal; isaacson  long  ward; gross  hamilton; mccarthy  harris  dowson.  replacements: peel  wilson  thompson  parling  sititi  charlton  shaw.  goodridge; garvey  simpson-daniel  fanolua  kiole; paul  gomarsall; wood  curnier  powell; eustace  brown; forrester  buxton  balding.  replacements: elloway  sigley  cornwell  narraway  page  davies  mauger.
sport,verdict delay for greek sprinters greek athletics  governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters costas kenteris and katerina thanou for missing doping tests.  the pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests  including one on the eve of last year s athens olympics. they were set to learn their fate by the end of february  but late evidence from them has pushed the date back.  a decision is now expected by around mid-march   said one of their lawyers  michalis dimitrakopoulos. kenteris  31  who won the men s 200m title at the 2000 sydney games and thanou  30  who won the women s 100m silver medal in sydney  face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. the athletes  who spectacularly withdrew from the athens olympics  have been suspended by the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) for missing the three tests. the iaaf said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens and ordered greek athletic s governing body  segas  to hold a disciplinary inquiry. the athletes also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the athens test  which led to them spending four days in hospital. following the final hearing in late january  the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted.  i am confident and optimistic   thanou had said at the time.  we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.  it was not clear what this new evidence was.
sport,ferguson rues failure to cut gap boss sir alex ferguson was left ruing manchester united s failure to close the gap on chelsea  everton and arsenal after his side s 1-1 draw with fulham.  premiership leaders chelsea and the gunners endured a 2-2 stalemate on sunday  giving united the chance to make up some ground in the league. but ferguson said:  i think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend.  it was a great opportunity - and we haven t delivered.  united went ahead through alan smith in the 33rd minute before bouba diop s superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors  lead in the 87th minute. ferguson described the result as an  absolute giveaway  after united had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. he said:  it was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn t finish them off.  in fairness  it s a fantastic strike from the fulham player.  the result leaves ferguson s side fourth in the league on 31 points - four points behind arsenal and a further five back from chelsea.
politics,tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours  free sports training a week by a future tory government  the party has said.  the club2school policy would provide up to £250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after-school sport. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.  the plans would help tackle the  fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world   he said. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy.  we aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151 000 sports clubs in the uk.  the tories say labour s plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1  3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at key stage 2  met that target. the tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities  only £41m had been spent. but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.
sport,souness eyes summer move for owen newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen.  he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer  who is due to retire in the summer  although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on.  michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we re monitoring him   he told bbc newcastle.  he is a great centre-forward and only 25 but i don t think we re the only ones monitoring the situation at real.  souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn s club scoring record may influence the striker s decision.  milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957  while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name.  without giving too much away  i am confident he will be here next season   said souness.  i can t imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn s scoring record.  souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window. the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phone-in for bbc newcastle  souness said tried to re-sign him  but villa were not interested in selling.  the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed.  i m after three  four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets   he said.  don t think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `who are we going to target now
politics,labour trio  had vote-rig factory  three labour councillors in birmingham were caught operating a  vote-rigging factory   an election court has heard.  police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in june 2004  the hearing was told. the votes were later counted towards that month s english local elections. the men  elected to the aston ward  deny collecting votes fraudulently. the judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. deputy high court judge richard mawrey  qc told the hearing at the birmingham and midlands institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming general election.  the special election court  the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging  opened in birmingham last month. the case against muhammad afzal  mohammed islam and mohammed kazi is being brought by local liberal democrat supporters. they claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 june election. ravi sukul  counsel for the petitioners  accused the three men of being  deeply involved  in illegal practices. witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office  which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off birch road east  the court was told.  the police were alerted and called to the premises. mr sukul said:  when (the officers) arrived there  in the middle of the night  they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six asian men present.  hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table.  the police officers left the warehouse  but were later ordered back to seize the documents.  when the officers left  all the envelopes and papers were scattered   mr sukul said.

sport,chelsea ridiculed over complaint barcelona assistant coach henk ten cate has branded chelsea s expected complaint to uefa as  pathetic .  the blues are poised to complain about an alleged half-time incident during wednesday s 2-1 loss at the nou camp. the source of chelsea s anger was an alleged talk between barca boss frank rijkaard and referee anders frisk  who later dismissed didier drogba.  to react the way chelsea have is pathetic. mourinho lied with the line-ups  and now this   ten cate said. uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half-time break. spokesman william gaillard said:  frisk says rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game.  we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it. the referee s dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in.  indeed  it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat.  uefa delegate thomas giordano added:  the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference.  the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa - weakening chelsea s case. rijkaard was critical of mourinho s decision not to speak to the media after the match.  there was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game. it is not good behaviour after a match   he said.  maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is. i really don t understand it. i am very calm about it.   barca midfielder deco  formerly managed by mourinho at porto  agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge a protest.  it s not normal behaviour on his part. it was not logical he did not give a news conference   he said. rijkaard added:  chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the english league and they defend very well so i am very pleased with the win.  my men deserved victory and i am pleased to have won this match. i congratulate my players.
politics,uk  discriminated against roma  the government s immigration rules racially discriminated against roma (gypsies) seeking entry into the uk  the law lords have ruled.  it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people  mostly roma  from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital  prague. civil rights group liberty said it exposed  racism at the heart of the government s asylum policy . the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. it said it would look at the implications of the ruling  but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe.  the screening took place at the airport in july 2001  at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain.  those refused  pre-clearance  were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk  because no airline would carry them. lady hale  sitting with lords bingham  steyn  hope and carswell  said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution. but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers  acting on racial grounds . lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way  only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.  liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs. it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain  and that of the european roma rights centre  which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people. it lost a high court action in october 2002 when a judge said the system was  no more or less objectionable  than a visa control system. he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.  the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma  but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries  but it does not allow officers to go further than that.  responding to the ruling  a home office spokesman said:  the scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk.   welcoming the ruling  maeve sherlock  chief executive of the refugee council  said:  human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented  and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group.  amnesty international s jan shaw said:  that the government s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse  not least in the czech republic.  but the chairman of migration watch uk  sir andrew green  said the house of lords decision was a  step in the wrong direction .  the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.
sport,ireland surge past scots ireland maintained their six nations grand slam ambitions with an impressive victory over scotland at murrayfield.  hugo southwell s try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o kelly and paul o connell put the visitors in command by half-time. a third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o gara  who kicked 13 points  extended the lead. jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. after two hard-earned away victories  eddie o sullivan  side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh  but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. the home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. a powerful charge from flanker jason white was carried on by ali hogg and when ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line  scotland kicked it to touch. the irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion  but a stray hand in a ruck allowed paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.  if that was a paltry reward for their early pressure  scotland got the try they deserved when paterson s searing break and andy craig s pass sent southwell streaking to the right corner. paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half dan parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an o gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. stuart grimes pulled down o kelly at a line-out  ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece  the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.  o gara added the conversion and a further penalty  after shane horgan almost grabbed a second try from o gara s chip to the corner  only for the ball to spill from his hand. but ireland still delivered a hammer blow to scotland s hopes just before the interval. o connell - skipper in the absence of brian o driscoll - powered through parks  weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.  scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when ireland flanker johnny o connor won another vital turnover  and o gara s basketball pass sent hickie over in the left corner. o gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. stuart grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. but it proved a false dawn  and ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. peter stringer and o kelly combined to put giant prop hayes over in the right corner before replacement gavin duffy scorched away on the left  david humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.  : c paterson; s danielli  a craig  h southwell  s lamont; d parks  c cusiter; t smith  g bulloch (capt)  g kerr; s grimes  s murray; j white  a hogg  j petrie.  r russell  b douglas  n hines  j dunbar  m blair  g ross  b hinshelwood.  g murphy; g dempsey  s horgan  k maggs  d hickie  r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes  m o kelly  p o connell  s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  g duffy.  joel jutge (france)
sport,lions blow to world cup winners british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship.  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand.  i don t think you can ever say never   said woodward.  but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.  dallaglio  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.
sport,mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend s spar european indoor championships in madrid.  the 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites.  i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield  i can run my race from the front  back or middle   said mcilroy. new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroy s career back on track. the 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester. lester is better known for his work with 400m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season.  mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in 1998.  that was my last decent year   said mcilroy  who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester s shrewd guidance.  before  every race was like trying to climb mount everest and i now know you can t do it on your own.  trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line  which became a bit too much.  mcilroy  who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe  steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days  is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding. that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season. russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself  dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed.  he admitted:  he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion.  i never write myself off and let s face it  i haven t or looked like being beaten this season.  and mcilroy  whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk all-time list  is also already looking beyond madrid. he said:  i ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important.  ultimately of course  this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer s world championships.  that ambition has meant that i ve had only two nights out since last august. the rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.
politics,mp s shock at long lost daughter labour mp stephen pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was  out of control  during the  wild  1960s.  lucy  36  tracked down mr pound after her birth mother told her he was known as  precious  at school. despite being told he was a  nutter who died at sea  she found a reference to mr pound on friends reunited. lucy s mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. mr pound found out about it last year. that happened when lucy wrote to his parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.  mr pound  who is now married with two other teenage children  said:  i was a nutter and i was a sailor but i wasn t dead.  he said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a  set-up  but he then realised all the dates fitted.  it was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. i felt guilt in the marrow of my bones   said the ealing north mp.  i don t blame lucy s mother. i was pretty much out of control. i was 18 when she was conceived. it was a different time - it was pretty wild.   mr pound says he rang lucy as soon as he got her letter  they met up and have been in contact ever since. describing that first meeting at london s king cross station  he said:  the earth went from under my feet ... we were walking across the euston road and i took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection.  we were finishing each other sentences.  lucy  who was adopted by a family from essex  wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. mr pound said his wife maggie had been fully supportive and their two children emily  16  and pelham  14 were pleased to have an older sister.
politics,lord scarman  93  dies peacefully distinguished lawyer lord scarman  who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 brixton riots  has died aged 93.  the peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career  serving as law commission chairman in its first seven years. he also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in northern ireland. paying tribute  the lord chancellor lord falconer said lord scarman was one of the  great advocates of our generation .   his legacy from his decisions in the lords and the court of appeal is substantial.  his work in the wake of the brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.   a great judge  a great lawyer and a great man.  lord scarman s nephew george ritchie said the peer  who passed away peacefully on wednesday  would be  sadly missed .  the lord chief justice  lord woolf  who is the most senior judge in england and wales  said it was lord scarman s  pioneering work  which paved the way for the human rights act 1998.  he was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature  and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society   he said.  he was  personally  totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.   dame elizabeth butler-sloss  the president of the family justice division  said lord scarman was a  good and humane judge  and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. lord scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. during the following three days of disturbances that spread to the midlands  merseyside  bristol and leeds  nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.  the inquiry famously settled on the so-called  rotten apples  theory  which argued that only a few police officers were racist  saying most were not. it spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the police complaints authority. trevor phillips  chair of the commission for racial equality  praised lord scarman s  ability to listen . he said:  when lord scarman toured the streets of brixton his presence was electrifying.  a community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the english establishment.  his great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds  many of whose language he could barely understand  genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings.  he never lost the special combination of wisdom  humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the brixton riots.
politics,ex-pm lord callaghan dies aged 92 former labour prime minister lord callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday.  he passed away at home in east sussex  just 11 days after his wife audrey died aged 91. lord callaghan  who leaves a son and two daughters  was the longest living former british pm in history. he entered downing street in 1976 after the resignation of harold wilson. prime minister tony blair called him a  giant  of the labour movement. he held each of the major offices of chancellor  home secretary  foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became lord callaghan of cardiff in 1987.  chancellor gordon brown said the former pm would be  mourned throughout the world .  it was a commitment to public service that brought jim callaghan into parliament in 1945  and while jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots.  former cabinet colleague lord hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was  immense sadness .   it was not a major surprise - i knew what a blow the death of his wife audrey was a few days ago   he said.  he was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely.   the labour party and the country will be poorer without him.  conservative peer lord heseltine said that despite their political differences  he and lord callaghan became friends.  you don t get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination   he said.  but i saw the other side of jim callaghan  he became a personal friend in a way  and my family and i were very fond of him.  tory leader michael howard said he would be remembered with  affection and respect . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said:  when i was first elected in 1983 as the youngest mp  he was the  father of the house  and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in parliament.   he was always full of warmth and wisdom.  born in 1912 and educated at portsmouth northern secondary school  lord callaghan became a clerk at the inland revenue. he enlisted in the royal navy in 1942 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. elected for a cardiff constituency at the 1945 general election  he represented cardiff seats for more than 40 years. after serving as a junior minister in the attlee government  he became chancellor of the exchequer when labour returned to power in 1964.  with sterling under pressure  he resisted devaluation for three years  before being forced into it in 1967. his political career was not without controversy. when he refused to support prime minister harold wilson and dame barbara castle over the latter s trade union manifesto  in place of strife  in 1968  he said:  i am not going to resign. they will have to throw me out . when home secretary  he ordered british troops to march into the streets of belfast to protect catholic civilians amid rising violence - a decision that has dominated british politics into the 21st century.  as foreign secretary in the early 1970s  lord callaghan kept an open mind about the uk s entry into the common market  seeing the advantages of the uk s entry. he once travelled to idi amin s uganda in 1975 to plead for the life of a british lecturer  dennis hills  who was under a death sentence for treason.  his political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party. in the autumn of 1978  before the  winter of discontent  when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill  lord callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a labour victory. as garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff  council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work  lord callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country. when britain went to the polls in 1979  tory leader margaret thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory  and lord callaghan resigned as labour leader.
sport,ireland 19-13 england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road.  a second-half try from captain brian o driscoll and 14 points from ronan o gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948. england scored first through martin corry but had  tries  from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed. andy robinson s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final. the defeat also heralded england s worst run in the championship since 1987. ireland last won the title  then the five nations  in 1985  but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales. and eddie o sullivan s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road. in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin  ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when o gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.  england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland s half produced a simple score for corry. the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line  racing 25 yards to touch down. england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left  but almost immediately o gara  winning his 50th cap  answered with two penalties in quick succession. england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes  and hodgson  the villain at twickenham  coolly bisected the posts. the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking  but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. a series of probes led by the talismanic o driscoll  back from hamstring injury  resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch.  from the line-out  the ball was recycled back to o gara  who stroked his second drop-goal  this time off the right upright. as the interval approached  wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england s most promising attack. the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson s cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score  but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half. but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded o gara a kick at goal  which he missed. england s pressure continued  and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal.  the lead was shortlived  however. ireland raced upfield  deft handling from the backs  including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson  ending with o driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. o gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear  and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson s cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line. anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high  but o gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. inside the last 10 minutes  england poured forward  spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson  who replaced leicester s harry ellis. but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win. ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks  time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff. england are still to meet italy at twickenham  in what is now a wooden spoon decider  and scotland.  g murphy; g dempsey  b o driscoll  s horgan  d hickie; r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes; m o kelly  p o connell; s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  k maggs.  j robinson (capt); m cueto  j noon  o barkley  j lewsey; c hodgson  h ellis; g rowntree  s thompson  m stevens; d grewcock  b kay; j worsley  l moody  m corry.  a titterrell  d bell  s borthwick  a hazell  m dawson  a goode  o smith.
politics,gurkhas to help tsunami victims britain has offered to send a company of 120 gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in indonesia  downing street said.  the deployment would involve troops from the 2nd battalion royal gurkha rifles  based in brunei. discussions have begun with indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment  but the government said the offer was aimed at the aceh province. downing st said a similar offer might be made to the sri lankan government.  however a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in indonesia which the gurkhas might be able to help with. the spokesman said:  following this morning s daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort  the government has formally offered the indonesian government the assistance of a company of british army gurkhas from 2nd battalion royal gurkha rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters.  this is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the indian ocean.   indonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami  with 94 000 of the 140 000 confirmed deaths so far. international development minister gareth thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of aceh.  we have offered the gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort  particularly in aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the indian ocean at the moment   he said.  we ve also had raf aircraft flying in equipment which the un desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in aceh province as well.  the offer comes as the foreign secretary jack straw arrives in indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.
sport,jones happy with henson heroics wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england.  jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales  9-8 down  were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff.  i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me   jones said.  when he said he wanted it  there were no problems.  jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour  before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left.  i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it   jones added.  i said to gareth (thomas  the wales captain)  this is touch and go.  it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it.  there were no questions that he d miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game.  jones was happy to hail henson s heroic contribution to wales  first win over england in cardiff since 1993.  physically he s a specimen: he s a balanced player  he glides when he runs and obviously he s got a great kicking game as well   jones said.   his defence was superb  he made some great hits and he had a great game.  i m glad he s welsh.  victory over england for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year s six nations. but they now face three away fixtures in italy  france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff.  people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby   said a proud coach mike ruddock.  but we are not there yet. the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins.  we have to travel this week and we can t afford to get too giddy about this result.  we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy.   none more so than henson  who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o driscoll. the confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however.  i m the sort of player who likes pressure on me   he said.  it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure.  i set a high standard against england and i ve got to back it up next week.  two years ago when we played italy i wasn t involved and we lost  so we ve got to put that right next week.
politics,hague  given up  his pm ambition former conservative leader william hague says he will not stand for the leadership again  having given up his ambition to be prime minister.  mr hague  43  told the daily telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too  boring  and unfulfilling. mr hague  who stepped down after his party s 2001 election defeat  does not rule out a return to the front bench. he also told the paper he hopes to remain mp for richmond  north yorks  and start a family with wife ffion. mr hague  who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger  also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.  he told the newspaper:  i don t know whether i will ever go back on to the front  but don t rush me.  asked if he would stand for the leadership again  mr hague replied:  no. definitely not.  his determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior conservative members  who say the party needs him. tim collins  the shadow education secretary  said last week it would be a  huge boost  to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench. mr hague became an mp at 27 and leader of the opposition at 36. he said:  i feel fortunate that  by the age of 40  i had crammed in an entire political career.  i had been in the cabinet and been leader of the party  so now i can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.  mr hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister.  maybe i wasn t as driven by politics as i thought i was   he said.
politics,blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.  the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti-terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november. mr blair said the bill  which brings in house arrest for terror suspects  had time limiting safeguards already. the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. the lib dems also oppose the plans.  the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.  mr blair s refusal to accept the tories  sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords. peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday. the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.  the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders  not just house arrest. shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four s the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a  recruiting sergeant  for terrorists. he went on to say:  if we don t get the amendments we regard as essential  including the sunset clause  we will vote against the bill.  in the commons  mr howard said it would be  far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through . mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.  the second  less stringent  type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by  an eminent and independent person .  i believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk   said mr blair. the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  there s a lot of talking left. i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.  a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a  basic principle  that people should only be punished after a fair trial. she added:  having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.
sport,mauresmo opens with victory in la amelie mauresmo and maria sharapova won their opening matches at the tour championships in los angeles.  france s mauresmo routed vera zvonareva 6-1 6-0  while wimbledon champion sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow russian svetlana kuznetsova. american serena williams also won  edging russian elena dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. the event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.  mauresmo s win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake lindsay davenport for the number one spot. mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the us open before injury ushered davenport back in front.  since then  i feel very confident on court and my game is there. i want to get the ranking back  but it s very different than before i was number one.  it was an obsession  but now i take it in a relaxed way.  mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as russia s zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.   she got mad a little bit and i played some great tennis   said mauresmo  who was runner-up to kim clijsters in last year s final. zvonareva has lost both her games so far  having crashed 6-2 6-4 kuznetsova in the staples centre on wednesday.  sometimes not everything works   she said.  it was lots of pressure. maybe that is why i couldn t do 100%. but i was fighting.  sharapova  who lost 6-2 6-2 to kuznetsova in beijing in september  said:  in beijing  she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable.  this time  it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.  the tournament debutant added:  i love it here. the atmosphere is great.  to be here where the lakers play  you just feel that excitement. i love basketball.  williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days.  it s hard to go out there and get it right but i m fighting and i m hoping   said williams.  what makes me happy is the effort. i had a really good effort today.  i m trying to add new dimensions to my game.
politics,nuclear dumpsite  plan attacked plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the uk have been branded  deeply irresponsible  by the liberal democrats.  the government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ilw) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the uk. the cash raised will go towards the uk s nuclear clean-up programme. but lib dem norman baker accused ministers of turning britain into a  nuclear dumpsite .  under current contracts  british nuclear fuels should return all but low level waste  but none has ever been sent back. in future  only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin  normally germany or japan  under armed guard. intermediate waste from countries such as japan  germany  spain  italy  switzerland and sweden will be stored permanently in the uk. at the moment  this waste is stored at sellafield  in cumbria  in the form of glass bricks  untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. in a statement  the department of trade and industry said the new policy meant there would be a  sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries . and it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner  ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.  trade secretary patricia hewitt said the new arrangements  revealed in a commons written statement  would raise up to £680m for britain s nuclear clean-up programme  under the new nuclear decommissioning agency. but the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the liberal democrats. mr baker  the lib dem environment spokesman  said:  i have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. but now our worst fears have been confirmed.  once again britain s environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the treasury and dti.  this is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites.  the energy act was supposed to help britain clean up  but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite.  the nuclear industry is an economic  social and environmental millstone that hangs around britain s neck.
politics,chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters  warning the  stakes are too high  to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.  the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a  clear and fundamental  choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party s spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour.  to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre  mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher  gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative s record in government he said:  i give you this promise - with labour  britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation  15% interest rates  £3bn in lost reserves  250 000 repossessed  one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.  never again tory boom and bust.   this will be the central dividing line at the election  between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services  and a labour government taking britain forward  which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals  schools and public services and  i am proud to say  spend by 2008 £60bn more.  turning to the economy  the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.  he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder.  my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto   he said.  and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers  initiative.  in the speech  which prompted a standing ovation  he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.  he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world s poorest countries  a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds  the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech  shadow chief secretary to the treasury  george osborne  said:  this was more talk from gordon brown.  we ve heard it all before. instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past.  he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans.  there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives  or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown.   liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it.  for all his trumpeting of labour s management of the economy  gordon brown s record is very mixed   he said.  gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy  a system which subjects millions of people to means testing  and a system of taxation which is extremely complex.  for all his positive words  gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon  not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.  also in gateshead  the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail  text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign. mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible  but not before the job was done. he also said he wanted to carry on as pm  because i still think that there are big changes our country needs .
politics,asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania.  the trial scheme  which could start in weeks  may be extended to apply to children from other countries. children s charities have reacted with alarm  saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children s best interests if it reunites them with their communities.  the pilot  included in the government s five-year immigration plan  aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims.  since 2002  at least 9 000 under-18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now  ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return  according to sources  although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families  should they be traced  or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.  under the 1989 children act  public bodies have a duty to act in the  best interest  of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns  not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania.   if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis   she said.  we do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in albania].  if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child  then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.  in its five-year immigration plan  announced on tuesday  the government said it was addressing  the difficult issue  of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children  and leave them to rot .  we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused   said the spokesman.  we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.   we do not believe that it is right  or in keeping with children s legislation  that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities.  the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned  he said. but andrew hogg  spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture  said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies.  from what is so far known  we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account   said mr hogg.  in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure.  the medical foundation has many serious concerns  including the assessment process for suitability for return  the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare  and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.  a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme  but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.
politics,choose hope over fear - kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election  said charles kennedy.  in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and  populist scares . he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been  very heartening  to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster  which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.  the general election would be a three-party struggle  as the conservative party  fades away  as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands  he said.  a clear division is emerging in british politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope.  labour is counting on the politics of fear  ratcheting up talk of threats  crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the european  menace    he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.  it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison  ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights  he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury  plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials  curbing of rights to protest  increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination.  but at the same time  an overmighty state is a dangerous one   he said. his party  instinctively  understood the  new liberal britain  which is no longer a nation with one family structure  and one colour  he said.  we are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality.  our national institutions are changing too. we are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. in our attitudes and the way we live our lives  this is in many ways a liberal britain.
sport,iaaf to rule on greek sprint pair greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are expected to find out on wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.  the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) council held a conference call on tuesday and are set to announce their decision. kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years. the duo withdrew from the olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. their former coach christos tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.  however  the iaaf will determine the sprinters  future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. the sport s ruling body is expected to direct the greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport. the sprinters both sent written explanations to the iaaf  which have been taken into account. the iaaf sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach tzekos after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete  where they had said they would be. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago  when they decided to fly back to greece early. just before the olympics  the pair dramatically missed another test in athens before withdrawing from the games. kenteris  31  won gold in the 200m at the sydney olympics in 2000  where thanou  29  won silver in the 100m.
politics,labour s  eu propaganda  a  taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise  on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security  say the tories.  shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw  who accused the tories of  running scared  of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls  he argued.  mr straw used thursday s commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security  stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july  said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe s economic output and were spent  where it adds most value . mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk s budget rebate  secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher  was  fully justified .  we  like all other countries  have a veto on any changes proposed in this area   he said.  mr ancram condemned the document  which the foreign office says has cost about £2 500 to design  print and deliver.  isn t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election    he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand.  the government  last week  had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this  easy and simple  constitution to the british people   he said.  who are they trying to kid   the proposed question for the constitution referendum is:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006  with the tories set to campaign for a  no  vote.  mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a  level playing field  on immigration and asylum controls.  you are setting your face against all of these things   he added. for the liberal democrats  sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets  he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans  backed by the uk  to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.
politics,tory expert denies defeatism the conservatives  campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned michael howard the party could not win the next general election.  the times on monday said australian lynton crosby told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the tories  commons presence by 25 to 30 seats. but mr crosby said in a statement:  i have never had any such conversation... and i do not hold that view.  mr howard later added there was not  one iota  of truth in the report. the strategist helped australia s pm  john howard  win four elections. mr howard appointed mr crosby as his elections chief last october. mr crosby s statement said:  the conservative party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week.  it added:  the labour party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people.
politics,kilroy-silk quits  shameful  ukip ex-chat show host robert kilroy-silk has quit the uk independence party and accused it of betraying its supporters.  the mep said he was ashamed to have joined the party  which he labelled as a  joke . he plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called veritas - latin for truth. ukip leader roger knapman said he would  break open the champagne   adding:  it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye .  however  he did say the ex-chat show host had been  quite useful initially .  he has remarkable ability to influence people but  sadly  after the (european) election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye    mr knapman told bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr knapman rejected the idea mr kilroy-silk posed a threat to ukip and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party.  mr kilroy-silk explained his reasons to his east midlands constituents at a meeting in hinckley  leicestershire. his decision came as ukip officials began a process which could have triggered mr kilroy-silk s expulsion. it marks the end of his membership of ukip after just nine months. it began with a flood of publicity which helped ukip into third place in last june s european elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership.  mr kilroy-silk accused his fellow ukip meps of being content with growing fat  sitting on their backsides  in brussels. he told bbc news 24:  i tried to change the party  i nagged all the way through the summer to do things  to get moving because i thought it was criminal what they were doing  it was a betrayal.  mr kilroy-silk also told sky news there was  masses of support  for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen.  ukip won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the european elections on the back of its call for the uk to leave the european union in his speech  mr kilroy-silk says the result offered ukip an  amazing opportunity  but the party s leadership had done nothing and  gone awol . there were no policies  no energy  no vision and no spokespeople  he said.  the party is going nowhere and i m embarrassed with its allies in europe and i m ashamed to be a member of the party   said mr kilroy-silk.  he said his conviction in britain s right to govern itself had not changed. he would continue that campaign outside ukip when he contested the general election in an east midlands constituency. reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to ukip s disciplinary committee for bringing the party into  disrepute . on thursday  the party challenged mr kilroy-silk to stand down as an mep so voters can get a genuine ukip candidate.
politics,correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped.  the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. the national correctional agency would have provided a  one-stop  justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. instead  scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison  preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.  scotland s reoffending rate is high  with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments  which provide community sentences  might have provided an answer. however  following a consultation on the idea  justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans. instead  ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.  she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday  aiming to  break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community . the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending. the minister said:  better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there.  communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better.  it costs the taxpayer £35 000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing.  taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison.  therefore  as we continue to invest in the service  it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves  to ministers and to parliament.
politics,kennedy calls for iraq exit plans tony blair should set out a proper exit strategy from iraq in the wake of next sunday s elections in the country  lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.  in a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of george w bush  mr kennedy said iraq had become a  crucible of militant terrorism . he wants to see a phased withdrawal of uk troops  as soon as the situation allows   he said in london. any exit strategy must  augment and support  the democratic process.   there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency   he said.  there is some truth in that  especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like fallujah  and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.  mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands  portugal and the czech republic  which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq  have announced their imminent withdrawal  regardless of the situation on the ground .  he accused mr blair s government of  being less than straightforward  over its plans.  next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in iraq   mr kennedy said during his city of london speech.  he should set out a proper exit strategy  including the phased withdrawal of british troops  as the security situation allows.  mr kennedy also argued that british troops deployed in iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries -  especially islamic countries .

sport,edwards tips idowu for euro gold world outdoor triple jump record holder and bbc pundit jonathan edwards believes phillips idowu can take gold at the european indoor championships.  idowu landed 17.30m at the british trials in sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings.  it s all down to him  but if he jumps as well as he did in sheffield he could win the gold medal   said edwards.  his ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.   idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a commonwealth silver medal to his name. edwards himself kept idowu off top spot at the manchester games. but he believes the european indoors in madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as britain s top triple jumper.  he has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning   said edwards.  phillips still needs to be much more consistent. i m sure a victory in madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.  the qualifying round of the men s triple jump in madrid takes place on friday with the final scheduled for saturday. olympic champion christian olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.
politics,assembly ballot papers  missing  hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the north east have  disappeared .  royal mail says it is investigating the situation  which has meant about 300 homes in county durham are not receiving voting packs. officials at darlington council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation. the all-postal votes of about two million electors are due to be handed in by 4 november. a spokesman for darlington council said:  we have sent out the ballot papers  the problem is with royal mail.  somewhere along the line  something has gone wrong and these ballot papers have not been delivered.  the royal mail is investigating to see if they can find out what the problem is.   a spokeswoman for royal mail said:  we are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the mowden area of darlington.  this is affecting several hundred properties  which have failed to receive ballot papers.  we are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem.  no-one will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary.  we are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote.   the darlington council spokesman added:  initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now.  we then made further investigations and it became clear this was a bigger issue.  a spokeswoman for the electoral commission told bbc news online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected. she said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time. so far a total of 569 072 ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the north east.
sport,wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle will be unveiled as the new wolves manager on tuesday.  the club have confirmed that the former england coach will be unveiled as the successor to dave jones at a news conference at molineux at 1100 gmt. hoddle has been linked with a return to former club southampton but wolves have won the race for his services. he has been out of the game since being sacked at spurs in september 2003 and worked alongside wolves caretaker boss stuart gray at southampton. hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job.  his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. the 47-year-old later returned to management with southampton  where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves. he engineered an upturn in saints  fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season. since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton. wolves are currently 17th in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday.
sport,radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday.  back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics  where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10 000m. bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race.   the ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete s belief that they can do it. every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it   are you strong enough to finish    the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence.  there is an old adage   get straight back on the horse that threw you    richards told bbc sport.  paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens.  she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running.  if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness.  she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.    for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york - win or lose. if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. but if she fails to triumph  she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship  appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.   athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions   explains richards  who has worked with past olympians.  she must not get caught up in someone else s agenda.  radcliffe s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york.  she just thought   well  they can t think any worse of me now    yelling told bbc sport.  she s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.    radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as  impulsive  but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets  such as redemption.  you can t change history   warned richards.  only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful.  paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.    the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better  with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs  final reserves.  radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon.  it s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again   said yelling  herself a marathon runner.  but that is only for long-term health and fitness.  when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. so physically it is possible for paula.  richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe.  the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens   he said.  and that just isn t going to be there in new york  that s been taken out of the equation.      radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time. and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage  starting in new york.  how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not   argues richards.   one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.  and yelling says:  i think this will probably make paula.   i think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it a better athlete.
sport,old firm pair handed suspensions celtic s henri camara and nacho novo of rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in a recent old firm game.  both were given automatic one-match bans and 12 additional disciplinary points for their actions. that means novo will miss a further two games because of his prior record. camara will miss one additional game. novo was found guilty of stamping on celtic s stephen pearson. camara was punished for kicking gregory vignal.  i m extremely disappointed. i don t know if there s a lot to add to that   said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo s punishment.  but what i will say is that i m at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game.  both players will miss this weekend s games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal.  the additional bans come into effect from 28 december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline. an sfa spokesman said:  they have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before friday.  but if they do appeal it won t be heard before this weekend because it takes a bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal.  meanwhile  bob malcolm and rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game. malcolm  a substitute on the day  was taken from the rangers dug-out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made. but the sfa would not detail what  if any  punishment malcolm would receive.  once rangers receive our letter we will be in a position to make a comment on the findings   added the spokesman.
politics,blair sets date for africa report the commission for africa s report will be released on 11 march - comic relief day  tony blair has said.  july s g8 summit in gleneagles in perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on africa. the announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer bob geldof - in london. as well as more aid  fairer trade and less debt  the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in africa. mr blair told a news conference:  it will be a report that s brutally frank about the reality  but i hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there.  it s an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it.   mr blair has vowed to put africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the g8. he acknowledged he would have a  a job of persuading to do  on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief. bob geldof  in characteristically blunt style  promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for africa. the former rock star s presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands. the people involved include two african government leaders and a range of other african politicians  as well as experts from some other developed countries.
sport,connors  rallying cry for british tennis  do you have it in your heart  how much guts do you have  how much do you hate to lose    these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain s brightest tennis hopes in the months  and possibly years  to come. the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a  long-term  relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga. and the man who epitomised the phrase  will to win  before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey.  you know  everybody hits the ball well and there s a very fine line between number one and number 100   said connors.  i was that fine line for a long time. but if i can help  i want to be part of teaching kids how to win.   connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta - his long-time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same. but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt  and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team.  britain has a different attitude  the right attitude  in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion   said connors.  that s something you don t find every day. everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect.  the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like i ve never seen before  especially over here.  this is not going to happen overnight  there are no miracle workers  but you re going in the right direction.  the 52-year-old s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america.  i ve had discussions with the usta (united states tennis association) over a number of years   he said.  that s where it (my input) ended.  connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain s young players.  if they re chosen  they ve got to produce   he said.   if not  someone will come and take their place. there s only one number one spot and it s lonely up there  but it s got the best view.  in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain s great new hope  connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon.  tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder   said connors.  i don t know that pressure  but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level.  someone s going to have to come and take over from him (henman). if i was andrew murray  i d embrace that. that s what we play for.  despite the emphasis on hard work  training and preparation  connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within.  the passion i had  i don t know if you can find that   he admitted.  i was also nuts. i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court.  it was the most important thing in the world for me  and to do that something s got to be not right with you. there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25 000 people.  what i had when i played tennis is what i am. you have to have that  you can t be moulded.
politics,ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.
sport,edu blasts arsenal arsenal s brazilian midfielder edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.  edu s deal expires next summer and he has been linked with spanish trio real madrid  barcelona and valencia. he told bbc sport:  i m not sure if i want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far.  if they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that s made me think.  edu s brother and representative amadeo fensao has previously said that arsenal s current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. and edu  26  added:  my brother is due to come to london on thursday.   there is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 january to sort it out with arsenal.  now i have a choice to stay or go. i want to sort it out as soon as possible  that s in the best interests of both the club and myself.  i m going to make my decision after the meeting later this week.  edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. the midfielder  who broke in to the brazilian national side in 2004  admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three spanish giants. edu said:  i ve just heard stories from the news that the madrid president florentino perez  the valencia people  as well as barcelona are interested.   that s nice  but i ve never talked to them  so i can t say they want me sign 100%.  last month wenger said he we was hopeful edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like real madrid would be too strong for edu. edu added that he had been encouraged by wenger s support for him.  i still have a good relationship with arsene wenger - he s always said he wants me to sign.
politics,straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union s arms embargo on china  despite opposition from the us and japan.  mr straw  visiting beijing  noted arms embargoes applied to china  burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea  which he said had a terrible rights record. the eu imposed its arms ban on china in 1989 after troops opened fire on protestors in tiananmen square. mr straw also signed a deal on china-uk tourism. it is expected this would increase the number of chinese tourists by 40 000 per year  providing $120m in revenue. china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven  and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. mr straw  speaking at a joint news conference with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing  stressed this point.  the result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china  either in quantitative or qualitative terms   mr straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.  but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be  irresponsible  and would damage britain s relations with the us. he said mr straw was  naive beyond belief  if he accepted china s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe.  when he was in tokyo earlier this week  japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove the embargo was   a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only japan  but also east asia overall . washington argues that if the embargo is lifted  it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland  by force if necessary. the us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams  from the uk s human rights watch  said:  this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.  but mr straw insisted the eu s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.
politics,conservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a  tough meeting  where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move  party sources told the bbc. the bill  which ministers claim will tackle crime  terrorism and illegal immigration  is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.  they have said the scheme is  deeply flawed  and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been  agnostic  on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence  the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards  the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said.  it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.   lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.  the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.  the new chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.
sport,clijsters hope on aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january s australian open because of her persistent wrist injury.  open chief paul mcnamee had said:  kim s wrist obviously isn t going to be rehabilitated.  but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry.  the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. but if there s the least risk she will stay away.  despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament  which begins on 17 january  clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. meanwhile  jelena dokic  who used to compete for australia  has opted out of the first grand slam of the season. dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. four-time champion monica seles  who has not played since last year s french open  is another absentee because of an injured left foot.
sport,fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson insisted he was  livid  after his side were denied two tries in sunday s 19-13 six nations loss to ireland in dublin.  mark cueto s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes.  [i m] absolutely spitting. i m livid. there s two tries we ve been cost   robinson told bbc sport.  we ve got to go back to technology. i don t know why we didn t.  south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather.  kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try.  i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey   said robinson.  it is how we use the technology. it is there  and it should be used.  i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both  and they both looked tries.  we are very disappointed  and this will hurt  there is no doubt about that.  we are upset now  but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that.   we did everything we could have done to win the game. i am very proud of my players and  with a couple of decisions  this could have been a very famous victory.  i thought we dominated. matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop  while the likes of charlie hodgson  martin corry and lewis moody all came through well.  josh lewsey was awesome  and every one of the forwards stood up out there. given the pressure we were under  credit must go to all the players.  we have done everything but win a game of rugby  but ireland are a good side. they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations.  england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.
politics,council tax rise  reasonable  welsh councils should set their taxes at  reasonable levels  after being given an average funding increase of 6%  says the assembly government.  finance minister sue essex said it was a  good deal  for local government. the £3.2bn settlement includes the  full  £7.4m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown. but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. in addition  £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. she said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was  confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.  the welsh local government association (wlga) had said on the eve of the announcement said that  significant  cuts to services may still be unavoidable. after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington  of torfaen  said it was vital that rises were minimsed.  a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems   said mr wellington.  it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.  on monday  a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds. ms essex said:  i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises.  i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax  particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.  she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels   even for those people who have moved up a band .  the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. ms essex said:  this is a good deal for local government  which will allow the well-managed councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.  plaid cymru s local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement  hugely disappointing . he said:  wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims - it is anger.   this will mean either a massive hike in council tax  massive cuts in services provided by councils  or both.  mike german  leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly  claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. mr german said:  i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. but the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.  conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change  is taking spin to the very verge of deception . he added:  around a third of welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.
politics,profile: gordon brown the ultimate prize of 10 downing street may continue to elude him but  as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget  gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.  he reached that milestone last june  when he overtook david lloyd george  who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor:  those who fail and those who get out in time. ) there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election. but  for now  mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.  gordon brown was born in glasgow on 20 february 1951  the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy. at 12  he was canvassing for labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in scotland. he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university  where he went on to complete a phd. his early career was spent lecturing  working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party.  his first attempt to enter westminster  for edinburgh south in 1979  was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs  michael ancram. but in 1983  he took dunfermline east  a new constituency including rosyth naval base  pit villages and coastal towns.  entering westminster  he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield  tony blair. within four years  mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury. he became shadow chancellor under john smith s leadership in 1992. after the death of leader john smith in 1994 he stood aside  agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington.  the other part of the deal  that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor  is the stuff of westminster legend. mr blair s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994  mr brown continued his devotion to politics. during the 1997 election campaign  he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day  six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.  this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown s former girlfriend of five years  princess marguerite of romania  the eldest daughter of ex-king michael of romania  who said a relationship with him was  politics  politics  politics .  if that was true then  mr brown  who married pr executive sarah macaulay in 2000  changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary  10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. a year later  in october 2003  the couple had a son - john - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. a trip to africa earlier this year  to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations  also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.  the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest. the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more  old labour  than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project. yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict  with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession. mr blair  for his part  is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown  who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute. after a recent run of negative headlines  labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering  for the good of the party. events like this  and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues  make it impossible to dismiss the brown/blair feud as just journalistic hearsay  cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster. how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.  a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign. but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown - using the budget as a springboard - is to revitalise labour s campaign. amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader. there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including mr milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can. and mr blair s decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister s intention to  serve a full third term  if elected  took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.
politics,hatfield executives go on trial engineering firm balfour beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the hatfield rail crash in 2000.  four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed. balfour beatty s railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at hatfield  hertfordshire. balfour beatty managers anthony walker and nicholas jeffries  and railtrack managers alistair cook  sean fugill and keith lea all face individual charges. all five men  along with four others  are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. balfour beatty rail maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. it is expected the trial could last as long as a year. the accident  on 17 october 2000  happened when the london to leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph  when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. the accident on the east coast main line sparked major disruption. the overall responsibility for the line was railtrack s - the company that has now become network rail. those who died in the accident were steve arthur  46  from pease pottage  west sussex; peter monkhouse  50  of headingley  leeds; leslie gray  43  of tuxford  nottingham; and robert james alcorn  37  of auckland  new zealand.
politics,turkey deal  to help world peace  a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of  fundamental importance  to the peace and security of the world  tony blair has said.  the deal  struck at the european council last week  also proved claims of a clash between muslims and christians were  wrong   mr blair said. it represented the achievement of an  historic british objective   he added. tory leader michael howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the eu was  anti-islamic .  turkey s involvement with the eu would provide an  invaluable bridge  between europe and the rest of the world  mr howard added. but the tory leader argued that the eu constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as turkey. mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. he insisted that the turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus.  it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member  but turkey  which occupies northern cyprus  had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country  calling the issue a  red line . it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join  and entry cannot be guaranteed. if it joins  turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however  talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.
sport,beckham relief as real go through david beckham expressed his relief at real madrid s passage to the champions league knockout phase.  after real s 3-0 win at roma  the england skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the bernabeu stadium. beckham said:  it s expected of madrid to get through  but it s a relief for the club and players to have won.  we lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.  real s finish as runners-up in their champions league group means they cannot face his old club manchester united in the next round. but real could be drawn against other premiership hopefuls  arsenal or chelsea  who won their respective groups.  it s going to be great whoever we play  even if we don t get either of the two english teams.
politics,burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting  honestly and instinctively   new guidelines say.  the law also protects those who use  something to hand  as a weapon. the leaflet  published by police and prosecutors  aims to combat confusion about current legislation  which lets people use  reasonable force . the guidance  relating to england and wales  follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. doing what you  honestly and instinctively  believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully  the guidance said.  and the law protects those who use  something to hand  as a weapon  said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo).  as a general rule  the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt  the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence  it said  adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further  or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of  excessive and gratuitous  force. the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use  grossly disproportionate  force. their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens. tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member s bill in parliament.  the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. home secretary charles clarke said:  i believe in that old adage  an englishman s home is his castle . that s exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that.  an  informal trawl  of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years  five of whom were convicted. they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire  before beating him up  throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.  a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. in one of britain s highest profile cases  norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar fred barras  in 1999. the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003. the guidance published on tuesday  said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were  determined  they would be dealt with  as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible   it said.
politics,civil servants in strike ballot the uk s biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290 000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.  the public and commercial services union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. unions have already earmarked 23 march for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million uk workers. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.  pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.   for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.  bbc correspondent stephen cape said the combined unions represented  a formidable force  which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the general election. a stoppage involving civil servants  in particular  could seriously disrupt or close government departments  agencies and museums  he said.  opposition to raising the retirement age is  one thing all the unions are agreed on   our correspondent added. unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. deputy prime minister john prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on thursday night. our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. there was  some possibility  of the strike action being avoided  he added.
sport,pountney handed ban and fine northampton coach budge pountney has been fined £2 000 and banned from match-day coaching for six weeks for calling a referee  a disgrace .  pountney was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute at a rugby football union disciplinary hearing in london on thursday night. pountney criticised referee steve lander s performance in northampton s defeat by saracens on 5 february. the last two weeks of the six-week ban are suspended. pountney pleaded guilty to the offence before a panel consisting of chairman robert horner  nigel gillingham and jeff probyn. the ban means former scotland international pountney cannot enter the playing enclosure  technical areas or go near the touchline  tunnel or players and officials  areas on the day of a game.
sport,reyes tricked into real admission jose antonio reyes has added to speculation linking him with a move from arsenal to real madrid after falling victim to a radio prank.  the spaniard believed he was talking to real madrid sporting director emilio butragueno when he allegedly berated his team-mates as  bad people .  i wish i was playing for real madrid   the 21-year-old told cadena cope.  hopefully it could happen. i love the way madrid play. i m not happy with the way things are.  the striker joined the gunners from seville for £17m at the start of 2004  but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick. he began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as arsenal have gradually lost the premiership initiative to manchester united and chelsea.  if i m not (playing for real) i m going to have to carry on playing with some bad people   he added.   i m sure there are none in the real dressing room.  i m happy madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since i was little to play there.  before the story surfaced  reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the spanish giants  issuing a statement through arsenal describing the speculation as  flattering .  i have seen the stories in the media linking me with real madrid   he had said on thursday lunchtime.  but not only am i under contract at arsenal  i am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies.  butragueno  meanwhile  was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey.  it is a disgrace  there is no foundation to this   he said.  he is an arsenal player and we have to be respectful. we have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news.
politics,uk needs tax cuts  tories insist a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper  the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began.  oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the £4bn tax cuts he was promising. tory co-chairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labour s record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later. tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure. but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.   can this country compete  can this country prosper  unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy   he said.  if we are going to take on the great challenges  the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians  we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax   he said.  the fact is the very carefully costed  fully funded plans we have laid out for saving £12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis.  mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes  borrowing and waste.  earlier  dr fox had said labour s rule had been characterised by  lost trust and failure to deliver . he also attacked the government s  failure  to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs  telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the  shambles  of immigration  put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools  he said. michael howard  who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday  will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening  after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill  which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.

sport,jones files lawsuit against conte marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte  whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation  made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday  conte said:  i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit  filed in the us district court in san francisco  said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she  has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements  the suit added  were  false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month  jones  lawyer richard nicholls said:  marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never  ever used performance-enhancing drugs.  victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment  while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory.  mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television  while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.   mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed.  the sport s ruling body  the iaaf  is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte  for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.  if it is felt there is case to answer  it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action   he added.  the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war.  and i am sure  like ourselves  they will be watching the television programme with great interest.  jones  who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency  has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal  although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones  who did not win any medals in athens in august  has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile  conte  who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering  is due to face trial in march.
politics,ministers  naive  over phone-taps the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court  a senior eu politician says.  javier solana  eu foreign policy chief  says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries. human rights groups  top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. mr solana told itv1 s jonathan dimbleby programme:  [phone-tap evidence in court] works  it is normal that it is done  it would be naive not to do it.  it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal.  mr solana s comments come the day after sir ian blair  the newly-appointed metropolitan police commissioner  said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.  under the anti-terrorism crimes and security act 2001  foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge. several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.  some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard  these detainees could be brought to trial. but critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal. he has opted for a system of  control orders  whereby suspects  both british and foreign  can be held under house arrest or surveillance. these orders will again involve a uk opt-out of parts of the european convention on human rights. while accepting that people  have to be prepared  for a possible terrorist attack  mr solana said he had  qualms  about the home secretary s new plans.  we have to fight terrorism with all our means  but not so far as to change our way of life   he said.
sport,mirza makes indian tennis history teenager sania mirza completed a superb week at the hyderabad open by becoming the first indian in history to win a wta singles title.  in front of a delirious home crowd  the 18-year-old battled past alyona bondarenko of the ukraine 6-4 5-7 6-3. mirza  ranked 134 in the world  sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against bondarenko.  it is a big moment in my career and i would like to thank everyone who has been a part of my effort   she said.  this win has made me believe more in myself and i can now hope to do better in the coming days.  i wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown.  at the australian open in january  mirza became the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam before losing to eventual champion serena williams.  and a year ago  she became the youngest indian to win a professional title by claiming the doubles at the hyderabad open. mirza  playing in her first wta final  began nervously in front of a raucous home crowd - committing three double faults in her opening service game. but from 0-2 down  mirza broke serve twice in a row and held on to her advantage to take the first set. in a see-saw second set  bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though mirza hauled herself level  the ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. at 5-3  the stadium erupted in celebration when mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net. mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd  she broke bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.
politics,labour s election love-in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days.  if press reports are to be believed  alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto. but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning  as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign. the event - at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity. and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.  the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs. then a vw camper van trundled into view  decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages -  lowest mortgage rate for 40 years . as the side-door slid open  it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together  scooby doo-style. but  sadly  it wasn t the cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking labour students. two were dressed as regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting  the longest period of economic growth for 200 years . another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the  lowest interest rates since the 1960s .  the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the  lowest unemployment since the seventies .  the politicians - led out by john prescott - were soberly-suited as always. the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown  but there was little doubt who was in charge. the chancellor walked side-by-side with mr milburn  pointedly exchanging chit chat  as they approached the microphone. but it was mr milburn who took centre stage  speaking of the  positive campaign  the party hoped to stage in the  coming weeks and months .  the mobile poster vans would  let people know britain is working again . mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s  shared purpose  and  united dedication . it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and  in a final flourish  to produce his famous pledge card  from 1997  claiming labour has met all of its promises. the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity. and  more specifically  to demonstrate the  central role  mr brown will play in the election campaign  despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn.  but keen students of body language will have had a field day. there was much forced smiling for the cameras  but only mr prescott  who revels in such occasions  seemed to be truly enjoying himself. mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor  as he spoke  nodding thoughtfully. but it was the former health secretary s final gesture  placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones  which was perhaps the most telling. thanks for dropping by gordon  he might have been saying.
sport,2004: an irish athletics year 2004 won t be remembered as one of irish athletics  great years.  the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably  seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august  a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics - or to be more accurate  the lack of it. sonia o sullivan s olympic farewell apart  there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous build-up to the games  we shouldn t have been surprised. at the start of the year  an o sullivan had been earmarked as ireland s best medal prospect but as it turned out  walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics  the sport was rocked by news that 10 000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombard s shattering of mark carroll s national 10 000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers  were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.  back at pre-olympic ranch in greece  it must have seemed that things couldn t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens  a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg s performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5 000m final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the women s 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days  the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. as it happened  she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically  the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly  she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over  it s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year  several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august  an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem  and a bad lane draw  meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.  james mcilroy  gareth turnbull  zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve  after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee s athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended  stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december. a large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy s many friends. as only death can  it put the year s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.
sport,murphy: that was a bruising battle that s what i call a tough game. it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory.  their organisation was very  very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by. it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced. we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship. it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early. we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually. it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it. i m not too bad  but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning. in the backs  we were not frustrated at such  but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical. the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult. but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half. it s always good to score. it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. eddie (o sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead. he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory.  that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half. we were penalised a lot at the breakdown  and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break. so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball. every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon. as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries  but it does not that good. now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover. it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter. i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday. it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions. we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us. in the meantime  when in rome ... .
politics,howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.  mr howard  whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk  says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called  no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would  like to kick your cat . ms robinson  a friend of the tory leader  also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was  much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  - although she denied having personal experience.  i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were.   documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s  his parents might not have been allowed into the country.  he replies:  what is the inference of that   that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants   that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition  it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.   ms robinson  who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government.  i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very  very draconian.  the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula  which he calls  good fun   apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife  ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses:  yeah  it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too  but otherwise it s quite fun.   former downing street communications chief alastair campbell  now working on labour s election campaign  says a  touchy-feely  image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents  early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a  big strategy   including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as  absolutely rubbish   arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is  conceivable  it could win the next election. but he adds:  it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.   - michael howard: no more mr nasty is being shown on bbc2 on saturday 12 february at 2005 gmt.
politics,kennedy begins pre-election tour liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the  real opposition .  mr kennedy is visiting constituencies in somerset and hampshire on monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives. later he will visit places  such as liverpool  where labour is targeted. labour say a lib dem vote could  let the tories in   while the tories say the lib dems would mean  higher taxes  soft crime laws  more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he  labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election  widely expected to be held on 5 may. on tuesday mr kennedy will visit leicester south  where lib dem mp parmjit singh gill overturned a big labour majority to win the seat in last year s by-election.  stops in shrewsbury  north dorset  liverpool  manchester  basingstoke and west london are planned for later in the week. the liberal democrats say in the northern cities  the race is between them and labour  while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday  mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in  recent experience . asked whether it was realistic to assume the liberal democrats could win the general election  he said:  there s no limit to the ambitions we have as a party.  but we have got to be responsible  we have got to be credible  we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task.   mr kennedy said the british public felt let down by labour on issues from iraq to top-up fees and the conservatives were not  asking the critical questions . and he said people were  highly sceptical  about labour and conservative promises on tax. but he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in  by the back door .  if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections  the liberal democrats have demonstrated that  not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position  but we can go on to defeat the government.  that s going to be the story  i think  of this coming general election.
sport,van nistelrooy set to return manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy may make his comeback after an achilles tendon injury in the fa cup fifth round tie at everton on saturday.  he has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the champions league tie with ac milan on 23 february. but manchester united manager sir alex ferguson hinted he may be back early. he said:  there is a chance he could be involved at everton but we ll just have to see how he comes through training.  the 28-year-old has been training in holland and ferguson said:  ruud comes back on tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is.  the training he has been doing in holland has been perfect and i am very satisfied with it.  even without van nistelrooy  united made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at manchester city on sunday. but they will be boosted by the return of the dutch international  who is the club s top scorer this season with 12 goals. he has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against west brom on 27 november. ferguson was unhappy with van nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. united have also been hit by injuries to both alan smith and louis saha during van nistelrooy s absence  meaning wayne rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. the teenager has responded with six goals in nine games  including the first goal against city on sunday.
sport,yelling takes cardiff hat-trick european cross-country champion hayley yelling completed a hat-trick of wins in the reebok cardiff cross challenge in bute park on sunday afternoon.  the part-time maths teacher beat irish international jolene byrne by 40 metres in the six-kilometre race. another great britain international  louise damen  finished third as part of the contingent representing england. peter riley  who secured bronze for the gb men s team at last month s european championships  won the men s 9km race. riley  representing england  moved away over the last two kilometres to win by 25 metres from ireland s gary murray. glynn tromans - the reigning uk inter-countries and england cross-country champion - came in third place as he continues his comeback from a five-month injury lay-off.
sport,robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.  robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france  with either tait or noon dropping out.  tait  given little opportunity to shine in attack  received praise from robinson afterwards  even if the coach admitted cardiff was an  unforgiving place  for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line  after just one outing  a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself  at least outwardly  appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular.  i want more of that definitely   he said.  hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see.  we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france.   his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales  try  conceded a penalty at the breakdown  was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch  all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half  but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front  the line-out remains fallible  despite a superb performance from chris jones  whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards  with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side  but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.
sport,middlesbrough 2-2 charlton a late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough a battling draw with charlton at the riverside.  matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off franck queudrue. but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser. shaun bartlett s strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue s pass to head home. the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. hreidarsson received danny murphy s free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.  charlton s early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right-footed strike. szilard nemeth  recalled in place of joseph-desire job  was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely. the striker played a great one-two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper s arms. boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.  it was all one-way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson s blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal. but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott s equaliser in the 74th minute. the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate s misdirected effort  but despite the charlton protests his goal stood. the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing  picking up hreidarsson s cross to easily sink his right-footed strike. but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. the 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock.   i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre.  we dominated after the break  the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win.  but for (charlton goalkeeper) dean kiely  who made three tremendous saves  we could have scored five or six.    to take the lead and then to get penned back  it feels a little bit like a defeat   admitted kiely.  we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. but we stood up and credit to us we didn t capitulate.  we ll kick on now. our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year.   nash  reiziger (graham 82)  riggott  southgate  queudrue  parlour (job 86)  doriva  nemeth (parnaby 87)  zenden  downing  hasselbaink.  subs not used: cooper  knight.  riggott 74  graham 86.  kiely  hreidarsson  perry  el karkouri  young  konchesky  murphy (euell 78)  holland  kishishev  thomas (johansson 72)  bartlett.  subs not used: fish  jeffers  andersen.  konchesky  hreidarsson  perry.  holland 14  bartlett 80.  29 603  m riley (w yorkshire).
sport,hodgson shoulders england blame fly-half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in england s 18-17 defeat to france.  hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win.  i m very disappointed with the result and with my myself   hodgson said.  it is very hard to take but it s something i will have to get through and come back stronger. my training s been good but it just didn t happen.  hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were  out of my range  but the centre could not convert his opportunities either  particularly the drop goal late on.  it wasn t a good strike   he added.  i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed. it s very disappointing  but i must recover.  andy robinson said he would  keep working on the kicking  with his squad. however  the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat.   we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done   he said.  they won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line.  it s very frustrating. the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half  they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn t build on it.  we took the ball into contact  and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side.  we have lost a game we should have won. there is a fine line between winning and losing  and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts.   england went in at half-time with a 17-6 lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit. england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france s improved second-half display.   we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time   he said.  we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us. they took their chances when they came.  it s very disappointing. last week we lost by two points  now one point.
sport,wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal s season.  almunia will start tuesday s champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday. wenger said:  you don t think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game  do you  i don t do that.  i have to give him a run for a few games. it s just that i don t want to make this story bigger than it is.  wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old spaniard  who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back-up to jens lehmann.   if you look at my career  you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time. i ve done it with dennis bergkamp  kanu  everybody.  it s because it s a goalkeeper  that s all. it s a usual situation for me. you put your best team out  no matter who it is.  for me  it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasn t alarmed by what happened against birmingham either.  it s nothing against lehmann. i think he s a great keeper  as is almunia. you can only play one of them.  these people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. just because lehmann doesn t play for two or three weeks  or longer or shorter  it doesn t mean i ve lost faith in him.   but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated. seaman told the daily mail:  jens is a fantastic keeper. he deserves another chance.  he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice.  with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension  inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable.  it puts a lot of pressure on them but it s a good learning process   said wenger.  i m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate.   the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. and the 30-year-old  whose current contract runs out in the summer  has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal. campbell said:  it means a lot to me to go through  it s everything. we want to carry on in this competition.  that s where the best teams in europe are. to be in there  playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy  is the first thing in my mind.   meanwhile  thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league. henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg. and the striker said:  if we don t win and we go out of the competition  like it or not  it s going to be my fault. that s the way it is.  if the team don t win i know i will be criticised  no matter how i play.
sport,ferguson puts faith in youngsters manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said he has no regrets after his second-string side lost 3-0 away at fenerbahce in the champions league.  ferguson said:  the good thing about being manager is that you are in control of which team to pick.  i care about united  that s important  so while i am disappointed at the result i am not at the team i selected.  this game was important for the young lads. they will remember it and next time they come they will be better.  ferguson admitted his side were well-beaten by the turks  a result which meant they finished second in group d behind lyon. he added:  they ll know not to play like that again. we showed a lack of strength. but i have no complaints about the scoreline.  in the second half we had some good moments in attack. and in that situation  you have to take one chance.  but we didn t do that  so the game just petered out for us.  i didn t think it made much difference whether we won the group or finished second and i still don t.  we could get inter  ac milan and juventus but bayern  barcelona and real madrid were among the runners-up. all we can do is let fate decide how it works out.
politics,lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered  the lib dems say.  sir alan budd s inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover s nanny. but he could not say whether mr blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. he told bbc news:  i m extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened.  that must be bad for government  it must be bad for public confidence in the system.   mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan s inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. he said:  there is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because  of course  next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that.  so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved.  the tories criticised the lib dem stance  saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett s word unless further evidence emerged. but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.
politics,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.  the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a  collective view  after holding a  good discussion   but admitted it was  not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.  tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo  his transport and environment spokesman  said the plans  stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would  set out the position very clearly  when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could  help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added:  when the police say that you have to take them seriously .  he acknowledged there were  good libertarian arguments  against the cards  but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the  conflicting interests  before reaching its decision.  i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.  he also denied he was afraid of looking  soft  on the issue  compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.  sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and  deeply flawed . he said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.   the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.  tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a  regressive  step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.
politics,howard unveils election platform the conservatives would stand up for the  forgotten majority   michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto.  the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values. in the foreword to the manifesto  he promises to focus on restoring order  trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. labour says the document offers only a return to a  failed tory past . the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.  campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election  which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june 2006. labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto. other chapters will follow in coming weeks.  in a speech in northamptonshire  he said the  forgotten majority  made up the backbone of britain. they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement  working hard and accepting their responsibilities. he says in the manifesto foreword:  they have been forgotten  neglected and taken for granted by mr blair.   saying britain must change direction  mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue  down the path of ever rising taxes . he promises to ensure frontline professionals  parents and patients make the key decisions rather than whitehall  bureaucrats . and he says the tories would get a grip on crime  immigration and disorder.  the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called  human rights  have left us in a moral quagmire  unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder   he says.  mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options  not specific plans. mr howard told bbc news:  i m determined to lower taxes but i m also determined not to make any promises i can t keep.  the tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies  he said. he was asked if tory support for the government on iraq and identity cards had given the lib dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to labour. mr howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for britain. it had nothing to do with putting  clear blue water  between himself and his opponents.  labour s election slogan will be:  britain s working  don t let the tories wreck it again . campaign coordinator alan milburn accused the tories of  launching thatcherism in instalments  while labour helped the hard working majority of families. lib dem president simon hughes said his party had set out its election stance in september.  the liberal democrats will ask the british people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust   he said.
politics,lib dems  new election pr chief the lib dems have appointed a senior figure from bt to be the party s new communications chief for their next general election effort.  sandy walkington will now work with senior figures such as matthew taylor on completing the party manifesto. party chief executive lord rennard said the appointment was a  significant strengthening of the lib dem team . mr walkington said he wanted the party to be ready for any  mischief  rivals or the media tried to throw at it.   my role will be to ensure this new public profile is effectively communicated at all levels   he said.  i also know the party will be put under scrutiny in the media and from the other parties as never before - and we will need to show ourselves ready and prepared to counter the mischief and misrepresentation that all too often comes from the party s opponents.  the party is already demonstrating on every issue that it is the effective opposition.  mr walkington s new job title is director of general election communications.
sport,rush future at chester uncertain ian rush s future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused a severance package.  chester have won only two of their last 10 league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the 43-year-old liverpool legend. vaughan said:  i offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them.  i haven t because of the finances  so technically they re still employees.  vaughan claimed that aizlewood had  verbally agreed  to the offer. but the chester chairman added:  after they discussed the offer with their solicitor  who also acts as their agent  they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement  which was disappointing.  rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool team-mate mark wright  who guided chester to the conference title last season. chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life  taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for october. chester s downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone.
sport,thompson says gerrard should stay liverpool legend phil thompson has pleaded with steve gerrard to reject any overtures from chelsea.  the ex-reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. he told bbc radio five live:  liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to steve in the end.  but it wouldn t have that same sweet feeling at chelsea  where it s all money-orientated and about simply buying the best.  thompson reacted sharply to some liverpool supporters  who criticised gerrard s performance in the carling cup final against chelsea. a number of fans questioned gerrard s commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in liverpool s 3-2 defeat as his first goal for chelsea.  thompson added:  i heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical  absolutely outrageous.  stevie carried the club last year and this year. he s always put liverpool first.  thompson  who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two european cup triumphs during his anfield playing career  is confident that the lure of champions league football will keep gerrard at anfield.  i hope champions league football will beckon for liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the premiership - and he will commit himself.  there has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately.  i hope he s hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but i hope it is to the benefit of steven gerrard and i hope it is worthwhile for liverpool.

sport,jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee.  ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte  of balco laboratories. jones  who says she is innocent  could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics. but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that  hoping only that  the truth will emerge .  any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing. the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago  but world anti-doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.  we will find a way to deal with that   pound said. in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols  jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared.  victor conte s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward   she said.  conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory  inconsistent statements.

politics,brown shrugs off economy fears gordon brown is to freeze petrol duty increases  fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.  in an upbeat pre-budget report  he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in uk  industrial history  but denied he was  gloating . but oliver letwin  for the tories  attacked government red tape and debt  dubbing mr brown  sir wastealot .  the shadow chancellor said mr brown s  golden rule  had  turned to dross in his hands  and said he was borrowing to spend  not invest  with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn. mr letwin told mps:  the tide is going out on the chancellor s credibility. he is spending  borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer s money.   vincent cable  for the liberal democrats  accused mr brown of ducking tough choices.  he said:  last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.  there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt. but they have not been confronted.  mr brown rejected the lib dem s call to open up the government s books to the national audit office  saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. bbc economic editor evan davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.  mr brown s insistence he was not  gloating  was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new european commissioner peter mandelson. in his speech  he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if labour wins the next election.  it includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine  with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. he also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from april 2007. and funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800gmt to look after children while their parents were at work. taken together  the measures would create a  welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history   said mr brown. he also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners  with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. in a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year  the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. the money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.  mr brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt  low and sustainable  - both in this economic cycle and the next. borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in march s budget  as already announced by the office for national statistics. borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than mr brown predicted in his march budget. inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow  mr brown forecast. he also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. but there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. simon sweetman  from the federation of small businesses  said:  the proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.
sport,rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men s tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season.  rusedski said:  i tried to order some but didn t receive any and i haven t got any yet.  you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond.  this event comes in the hottest period of the year  so you would hope the stuff would be available for it.  the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements. in response  the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men s tour.  david higdon  vice president of the atp  admitted:  i agree with greg.  i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it s a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing.  the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component.  we weren t going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them.   the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open.  and rusedski  who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday  conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial.  the good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee  so hopefully all this will never happen again   said rusedski.  hopefully after the australian open we won t have to discuss this any more.

politics,tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.  six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.  the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies  such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people  rather than officials  run hospitals and surgeries.  announcing the plans  mr redwood said:  mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers  and has broken the pledges he made.  far from improving public services  spending taxpayers  money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats  more regulation and higher taxes.  his party leader  michael howard  argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending.  labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain   he said.  in the real world  people are working harder just to stand still. they ve seen their pensions knocked for six.  they re being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain.   the government has announced plans to cut 100 000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans.  the conservatives are committed to cutting labour s public spending plans by a massive £35 billion   he said.  cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting  bureaucracy  but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools  hospitals and the police.  the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.
politics,taxes must be trusted - kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue  lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.  a day ahead of the government s pre-budget report  mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to  painful economic realities . he said the current level of taxation was about right  although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises. mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies.  speaking at the commonwealth club  mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility  both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. he said.  budgets have to add up. tough choices are needed in public spending.  the lib dems would cut  low priority  spending  including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund.  those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s  putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks  he said. the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees  providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the  polluter who pays .  the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises. mr kennedy said:  that contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans.  with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown  the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax  and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.  he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government s performance.  conservative co-chairman liam fox said: liam fox said  if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments.  the reality is  the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy  and the only people who would face  tough choices  would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year.   and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up. he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.
sport,ferguson rues failure to cut gap boss sir alex ferguson was left ruing manchester united s failure to close the gap on chelsea  everton and arsenal after his side s 1-1 draw with fulham.  premiership leaders chelsea and the gunners endured a 2-2 stalemate on sunday  giving united the chance to make up some ground in the league. but ferguson said:  i think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend.  it was a great opportunity - and we haven t delivered.  united went ahead through alan smith in the 33rd minute before bouba diop s superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors  lead in the 87th minute. ferguson described the result as an  absolute giveaway  after united had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. he said:  it was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn t finish them off.  in fairness  it s a fantastic strike from the fulham player.  the result leaves ferguson s side fourth in the league on 31 points - four points behind arsenal and a further five back from chelsea.
politics,end bush  denial  blair tells eu tony blair is urging european leaders to wake up from their  state of denial  over president bush s re-election.   america has spoken. the rest of the world should listen   the prime minister said in an interview with the times newspaper  published on friday. mr blair is at a summit in brussels  where iraq and european justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. french president jacques chirac reacted to his warning by saying europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. mr blair has probably been closer to president bush than any other european leader.  he said some people were in  a sort of state of denial  about the us election result but predicted a more  receptive mood  would emerge soon. america needed to listen to the world too  he said.  the fact is that president bush is there for four years. he is there because the american people have chosen him   he argued. he also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together.  britain was  uniquely placed  to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the us  he suggested. he admitted he had gone to bed at 2230gmt  well before the american polls closed  thinking mr kerry might have won. he woke up at 0530gmt to discover mr bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. his words about president bush met a cool reception from jacques chirac. the french president told reporters:  europe today has more than ever the need  the necessity  to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity.  that is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever.   mr chirac will miss an address to the summit from iraqi interim leader iyad allawi  who this week criticised nations which took a  spectator  role to iraq s reconstruction. mr chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the united arab emirates  late leader and says he would be happy to meet mr allawi. he also signed a communiqu&#233; stressing the eu s commitment to securing a stable and unified iraq. the eu also confirmed a new $21m aid package. the communiqu&#233; congratulated president bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. the summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline european asylum and immigration decisions. mr blair recently said the uk would only participate in eu-wide measures where it was in uk interests but the tories say he is surrendering a key veto. the meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in lisbon in 2000 to make europe more competitive.
sport,isinbayeva claims new world best pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in lievin on saturday.  it was the russian s 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham. the olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on france but failed to clear that height. in the men s 60m  former olympic 100m champion maurice greene could only finish second to leonard scott. it was greene s second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow american  who also won in birmingham last week.  i ran my race perfectly   said scott  who won in 6.46secs  his best time indoors.  i am happy even if i know that maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season.
politics,labour mp praises tory campaign the conservatives have been  a lot smarter  in the way they have conducted the general election campaign  a labour backbencher has said.  derek wyatt said having a five month campaign  turned off voters  and suggested people were already  rather bored of the thing . he wants a greater campaigning role for chancellor gordon brown. labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and mr brown therefore had a prominent role. but mr wyatt argued:  by some way  he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world.  so  it would be a tad foolish of the labour party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.   labour s election chief alan milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline mr brown after facing criticism for letting the tories set the agenda. however  mr wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. the mp for sittingbourne and sheppey said prime minister tony blair had been  trying very hard  to improve his own standing with the electorate through a  sort of campaign of trust . but mr blair had been  hurt  by the iraq controversy  he added. a labour party spokesman played down differences with mr wyatt and said mr brown already had a prominent campaign role.  this election is a choice between labour taking britain forward and the conservatives taking us back.
politics,watchdog probes e-mail deletions the information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of cabinet office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.  richard thomas  totally condemned  the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january. government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served  no current purpose   mr thomas said. the tories and the lib dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.  tory leader michael howard has written to tony blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. on monday lib dem constitutional affairs committee chairman alan beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the hutton inquiry. the timing of the new rules just before the freedom of information act comes into forces was  too unlikely to have been a coincidence   mr beith said. but a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or  the destruction of important records . mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the  e-mail regime  could  support the freedom of information regime .  mr thomas said:  the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.  he said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. all e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws  but the important thing was the content of the e-mail  said mr thomas.   if in doubt retain  that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. it s only when you ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it.  but any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.  the freedom of information act will cover england  wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies  subject to various exemptions. its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.
politics,howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees  michael howard has said.  as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans  mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. some charities say the plans would put refugees  lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.  tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans.  by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders  they will actually make the problem worse   said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick  fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was  absolutely disgusting  to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.  in a speech in london on monday  mr howard said:  it s not racist  as some people to claim  to talk about controlling immigration far from it.  he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that  firm but fair  immigration controls were essential for good community relations.    - withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees  which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need  not numbers   - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents   - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for  national security    - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin.     the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk.  mr howard said nearly 160 000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a  substantial reduction  in immigration  he said  although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current  unfair and inhumane  system.   we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum   mr howard said.  by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.   but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy  which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans  dangerous  ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible . lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled  she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.  he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion  disgraceful .
sport,sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish football association is awaiting referee hugh dallas s report before acting against hearts winger saulius mikoliunas.  mikoliunas  20  barged linesman andy davis  who had advised dallas to award rangers an injury-time penalty in hearts s 2-1 defeat at tynecastle.  he was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we don t know if he did something else after the whistle.  we don t know how many red cards he was shown   said an sfa statement. hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch. rangers  striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving the hearts keeper on the ground. the sfa said:  once the referee s report comes in then we ll immediately look at things.   we don t normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we re well aware of what happened here.  prso was sent off for two cautions  and that will just be a one-match suspension.  the sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southampton s david prutton was banned for 10-games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan wiley. hearts  boss john robertson said:  mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee s chest and got a red card for it.  the officials have got to take into account the fact he s a young lad.  but people have got to take into account why he was incensed. why were 10 000 hearts fans incensed   why did nobody from the rangers  bench claim for a penalty kick   rangers  boss alex mcleish accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off. mcleish said:  i m glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with dado trying to get the ball back from craig gordon.  but it was over-zealousness and i don t think hugh had any option.
politics,minimum wage increased to £5.05 the minimum wage will rise in october  benefiting more than 1m people  the government has announced.  adults must be paid at least £5.05 an hour  up from £4.85  while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid £4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen  warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a £6 rate.  a further increase in the adult rate to £5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006. according to the commission  many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage  challenging .  we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings  and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact   said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning  catering  shops and hairdressing.  unveiling the latest increase  mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a  symbol of decency and fairness .  for too long  poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families   he said.  too often  people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay.  chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh  wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast. the government has not accepted the commission s recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate  but says it will look again at the rate later on. mr brown said:  we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people  particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time.  the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.  the national minimum wage is currently set at £4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above  and at £4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. a £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds  but apprentices are exempt. the trade unions congress welcomed the increase  but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year. but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a  pause year  to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october. and david frost  director of the british chambers of commerce  said:  the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation.  what employers are saying to us now is that it s at a level where it s starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.   the liberal democrats  economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.  it s not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too   he said. conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not  seek to disturb  the increase. speaking on bbc radio 4 s woman s hour  mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers.  there are people on very low salaries  very low incomes indeed who really shouldn t be paying income tax   he said.  it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below £12 000 a year  with say no tax on below £6 000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over £100 000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage  yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the us! perhaps  we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the us. this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further.  it s still not good enough! i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £2.75 an hour  and working as hard as any of the older staff  maybe it s about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!  we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.  any increase is certainly welcome news. however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them:  would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour  . thought not ... so then  don t expect others to either.  i can t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you  it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either. br /&gt;  this is good news. the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker s relationship with their employer. wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee s efforts. for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.  it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries  bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr!  i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase  on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can t afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.  here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! we all remember michael howard s protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he s gone quiet on that one! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. i think if any job is worth doing then it s worth being paid a fair wage for  and £5.05 is hardly a fortune. if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds  a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people  so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!  great keep at it tony  i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. we can t afford not to pay a decent wage. it s not a jobs at any price economy  goodbye sweatshops hello decency.  the increase in minimum wage is a good thing. living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay  for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour. hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level  and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard  but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.  i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic  catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate. someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages  who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow   this is definitely the right step in the right direction. it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. this is a million votes more. good strategy isn t it   although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase  its timing stinks. i am quite prepared for a raft of  bribes  to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards  they are playing us for the fools they think we are.  this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. by increasing overheads  for business  there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt  or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. the extra cost this increase will bring  will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy  which  in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk  or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. the jubilation felt by  low-paid  workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.  this will only lead to a reduction in jobs. why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india. blair say s the economy is  strong and stable economy  however consumer debt and the country s debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses  that will have no choice but to cut the workforce.  the timing cannot be coincidental. this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such.  andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is  blatant electioneering . i don t mind if it is. in our degraded democracy  elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. if my maths is right  a 35 hour week at £5.05 gives you an annual income just over £9 000 and raising it to £6 leaves it under £11 000. the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more. businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay  shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.  i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level  but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less. it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as  sweat shop   but now we are told it is global competition. with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. the whole picture needs to be looked at.  this is great news  but that might be because i work for minimum wage. seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. when you can  earn  more from claiming than you can from work  there is no incentive. perhaps a step in the right direction.  if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work. how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked  they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries  after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.  while i m delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward  i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. as an employee for a small nursery  i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer  who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october s increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. if the rate rises to £6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.  the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales  it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff  overtime being the first to go.  i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80% of my costs are labour. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase  thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the  lower status  jobs.  i know about this great idea - don t bother getting qualifications  laze about at school  no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don t get fined because remember  when you do eventually start working  doesn t matter how lazy you are  you ll be guaranteed a decent wage. the ones who suffer are the employers.  i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping  or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door   i don t believe in the minimum wage at all! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. now  before everyone thinks that i am some  rich-kid   i can assure you i am not. i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning £25 per week. i worked hard  went to college part time  got my a-levels and degree & bettered myself. i now earn a 6 figure salary. i did that through hard work and getting off my backside. a minimum wage just makes people complacent.  to ashley  of swindon: when you earned £25 per week  it was worth something. these days that £25 would need to be near to £60 to have the equivalent buying power. i might add  that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation  people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.  in my day  type arguments are a view that belong in the  your day  - 20 years ago!  as a graduate working for minimum wage  i welcome any increase of pay i can get. i disagree with ashley  swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay. i have my gcse s a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can t afford the wages i should be getting  i should be on at least 3x what i m getting but they can t afford it. we all work hard but the money is just not there. but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn t change it just to get more pay.  as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year. these next rises will cost me more. i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. so no one really wins in the end.  in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well. if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. think of us employers as well mr blair  we are not all big corporations earning millions.  all workers should be entitled to a fair day s pay for a fair day s work. how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement   it is good news for many asians living in uk. students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.
politics,row over  police  power for csos the police federation has said it strongly opposes giving community support officers (csos) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.  the powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in england and wales on thursday. the federation said csos do not have the experience  training and safety equipment to deal with  potentially confrontational  situations. but the government said the move would help police  build safe communities . police federation chairman jan berry said civilian officers should act as  eyes and ears  for the police.   they should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is   she said. csos can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. the powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. ms berry said this  dramatically changes  their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. she said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.  but home office minister hazel blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers  just that little bit of edge . she denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.   the powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling   she said. the home office has produced its own report on csos which it describes as  encouraging . ms blears said the study shows csos are  making a real difference  in the fight against crime. but the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer.  shadow home secretary david davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that csos were having no discernible effect on crime figures.   while the answer is a lot more real police  the government wants to recruit 25 000 people who can t arrest anyone   he said. bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said the research is inconclusive. there are about 3 500 csos in england and wales but the government intends to have 25 000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of £50m. they already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences. the serious organised crime and police bill proposes extra powers to search suspects  enforce licensing offences  direct traffic and deter begging.
politics,prime minister s questions so who  if anyone  is playing politics with the security of the nation   michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who  he claims  is  ramming  through parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. he didn t say so  but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism. why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories  offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws  he demanded. the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. is not the opposition against to the proposed laws  in principle   in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless   what this is really about  believes mr blair  is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass  maybe even defeat the government. and that is more important to them than national security. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. he preferred to state that  as with other issues like id cards  the government s immediate instinct was authoritarian.  as is his habit nowadays  the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have  once again  just missed the point. apart from all that  it was electioneering as usual. the very first question to the prime minister from derby north s bob laxton asked him  in effect  if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. later birmingham s sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. the prime minister almost blushed. this was not the appropriate place to announce election day  he stammered. but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 april for an election on 5 may is where the big money is in the commons. and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment.
sport,sydney to host north v south game sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in june or july  the australian rugby union (aru) said on wednesday.  the match will include players from the lions tour of new zealand.  the australian rugby union has thrown its support behind a proposed north-south match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals   the aru said. the date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is sydney s olympic stadium. aru chief executive gary flowers said the world cricket charity match in melbourne earlier this month had inspired the aru.  we still need to discuss the options with the irb (international rugby board)  the lions and our sanzar (south africa  new zealand and australia rugby) partners  but june or july is seen as a better option than march to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available   he said. wallabies captain george gregan said the charity match was a  great initiative . tri-nations rivals australia  new zealand and south africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of six nations teams france  ireland  england  wales  italy and scotland. coach clive woodward s lions squad will tour new zealand in june and july  including tests on 25 june  2 and 9 july.  almost 80 000 fans packed into melbourne cricket ground on 10 january for a charity match that raised £5.9m for victims of the asian tsunami.
sport,castaignede fires laporte warning former france fly-half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales.  france suffered a shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. castaignede told bbc sport:  the pressure is big on laporte after a huge loss to new zealand  a slim win over scotland and a miracle against england.  but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road.  following victories over south africa and australia in november  france were deemed by many to be the world s leading side. but they were then trounced 45-6 by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had a try disallowed in their six nations opener. it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham. &lt;  castaignede said:  you can t say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte.  had england s kickers not been so bad  the position in the six nations would be very different now.  laporte has been criticised for france s negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england. but his side played a more free-flowing style against wales  making a mockery of the opposition s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval.  all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland   said castaignede ahead of the 12 march tie.  everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales. but everyone also wants a win.  castaignede  a veteran of 43 international caps  admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland.   going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now  it s harder than ever   said castaignede.  they re very experienced and don t often lose at home. they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.  despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run-in.  ireland have such a good pack but wales are something else on the break   he added.  at the weekend they were simply awesome. as a frenchman it was disappointing to see  but you had to admire it.  their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.  the 30-year-old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in paris last weekend.  delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too   said castaignede.  i m just glad i m not the one who has to make the decision.
politics,straw to attend auschwitz service foreign secretary jack straw will visit auschwitz for the 60th anniversary of the former nazi concentration camp s liberation  it has been announced.  prince edward will also join the uk delegation in poland for national holocaust memorial day on 27 january. between 1.1 and 1.5 million people  mainly jews  were killed at auschwitz. the tories said they were glad mr straw had been  shamed  into going  having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said:  i am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing britain at this important act of commemoration.  once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.   in britain  the queen and prince philip will lead the nation s commemoration at a service in westminster hall  london. the queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at st james s palace. altogether  some six million people  mainly jews  perished in the holocaust. the queen s grandson  prince harry  sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. the prince  20  apologised  but critics have called for him to go to auschwitz for the commemoration of the soviets  1945 liberation of the camp. prince harry should see for himself  the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear   rabbi marvin hier  founder of jewish human rights group the simon wiesenthal center said.
sport,davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys.  bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old  but that he would prefer to stay where he is. davies  one of the stars of saturday s rbs six nations win over england  is only on a year contract at kingsholm. but the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. the summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with neath rfc. although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management  he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated.  the wru didn t give me any help off the field  it was very disappointing   davies said at the time.  it was a hard time throughout the summer  then deciding whether to accept an offer from stade francais which would have ended my wales career.
sport,blues slam blackburn over savage birmingham have confirmed blackburn made a bid for robbie savage - but managing director karen brady has called it  derisory .  rovers have reportedly offered £500 000 up front for the wales star  30  with the fee rising to £2.2m. but brady told the sun the bid was  a waste of fax paper and my time . she added:  the way things are going all this could affect the relationship between the clubs. they ve got into robbie s head. but he s not for sale.  savage s future at birmingham has been the source of speculation for several weeks  with some fans criticising his performances for the club earlier in the season. however  good displays against west brom and aston villa have impressed blues fans.  the crowd gave me a massive standing ovation when i came off on saturday which was nice   he said.  it was fantastic even though i was criticised by a number of them in recent weeks and on saturday it showed how much i mean to them.  it s not for me to say (about transfer rumours)  it s between the two clubs.  i haven t created the speculation myself  i haven t phoned every national newspaper saying   blackburn are trying to buy me . it s not up to me.  birmingham manager steve bruce insists he does not want to sell savage.  a lot is said and written about sav but he has been terrific for birmingham city the last two and a half years   he said.   the fans love him because he epitomises them. he works hard  they like people like that and there are not many like him.  and why the hell should i sell him to someone else  i am not interested.
sport,funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby union s reorganisation at youth level.  an amalgamated under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday  against italy at the gnoll. but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students. as a result  traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled. the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union  reverend eldon phillips  said:  it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year.  the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches.  the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge  that is representative rugby  but this year that opportunity will be denied them. players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones  rob howley  jon humphreys  darren morris  martyn williams and ceri sweeney.
sport,roddick into san jose final andy roddick will play cyril saulnier in the final of the sap open in san jose on sunday.  the american top seed and defending champion overcame germany s tommy haas  the third seed  7-6 (7-3) 6-3. and saulnier survived an injury scare in his semi-final with seventh-seeded austrian jurgen melzer. the frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame melzer  who was left fuming over a series of line calls  6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3.  i was feeling horrible earlier in the week   roddick said.  i thought tonight was another step in the right direction.  on my returns  i was standing in more and i m getting a little more depth  even if i don t hit a perfect return.   roddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. but he broke straight back and then broke haas again to lead 4-2.  it s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don t do anything with them   admitted haas.  i rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.  saulnier will move into the world s top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final.  it s taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind   he revealed.  sometimes i didn t believe i could get to a final and now i am here. i ve stayed mentally strong.  i m on the way. i ll keep fighting and work a lot and i ll be up there.
politics,will the budget bring out smiling voters  as tory spokesman oliver letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners  wouldn t he.  and everyone does  indeed  expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 may. there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters  faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election. and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget. the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold  while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don t desert him at the third poll.  and  needless to say  there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. but there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts. that is the size of the financial  black hole  the tories  backed by some independent forecasters  believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.  the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. it was immediately denied  but the tories remain suspicious  claiming that  as mr letwin said  if the money does not come from there  where will it come from.  mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election  should labour win. previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong  he will argue  while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy  low unemployment and high public spending. the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound  increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.  the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy  but based on increased taxes to fund spending and  amongst other things  abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.
politics,no more concessions  on terror charles clarke says he has  no desire  to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde  tory leader in the lords  said ministers should expect it to be  substantially re-written .  the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against.  on monday  mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order  amounting to house arrest  would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should  prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill .  they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals  which are for house arrest.   but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.  no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made  but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords   he said.   i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill.  mr clarke s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate  shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been  clearly very badly drawn-up  and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to  rescue  the government and make the law  tolerable  by amending it in the lords.  the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous   he told bbc news.  mark oaten  for the liberal democrats  said monday night s vote showed the government had  lost the confidence of all sides of the house . he said:  they need to rethink the bill  and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders  build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects.  unless there is a major movement  this bill is doomed to fail.   bbc news political editor andrew marr said:  i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further.  the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march  when the current powers expire.
politics,goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials.  lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal  but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential.  in a statement  lord goldsmith said:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.   no other minister or official was involved in any way.  he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence.  as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   earlier  tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue.  on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.   the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan s involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code  and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith s statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues.  if his original advice of 7 march accepted that military action might be illegal  how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on 17 march   he said.  only the fullest disclosure will now do.
politics,crisis  ahead in social sciences  a national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up  a committee of mps has said.  there was an  absolute crisis  in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts  the commons science and technology committee added.  major problems  are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age  it said. the committee was reporting on the work  strategy and spending plans of the economic social research council.  the council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. it also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. in its report on the council s work the committee said:  we are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting  in particular  the qualitative branches of social sciences. this mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry  it said.  it is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of economic and social research council s limited resources.  if the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this.  a national  strategic capabilities fund  to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response  the committee added.
sport,wenger offers mutu hope arsenal boss arsene wenger would consider signing adrian mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban.  mutu was sacked by chelsea on friday after testing positive for cocaine - a move wenger has backed. but he said:  i don t even wonder if that could happen because i think he will be suspended for a long period.  but once he has served his suspension  he has the right again to start from zero. i would then meet the player and see what he tells me.  mutu faces a ban of between six months and two years when the football association decides on his punishment. chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed a drug test.  but mutu has hit out at the club s decision  saying:  chelsea have destroyed me.  he told the sunday mirror:  i don t know what i m going to do. i am shocked and surprised by their decision.  i didn t expect them to pay me while i was suspended but i never thought they would sack me either.  why didn t they wait to do this  now my career is in ruins.  i might as well walk away from football. what is there left for me    chelsea have been criticised for their stance  with the professional footballers  association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player. and mutu agreed  adding:  it is unfair. if they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards.  why did they go public  to make an example of me  it makes it very difficult for me now.
politics,february poll claim  speculation  reports that tony blair is planning a snap general election for february 2005 have been described as  idle speculation  by downing street.  a spokesman said he had  no idea  where the reports in the sunday times and sunday telegraph had come from. the papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a  baghdad bounce  following successful iraq elections in january. a british general election was last held in february in 1974. in that election  edward heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the liberals. harold wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election  the latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a february poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over conservative leader michael howard. but that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to  cut and run  after less then four years of a parliamentary term. the papers report that alan milburn  labour s head of elections strategy  has played a key role in the plan for a february election  which would include a new year advertising blitz. new labour s campaign  both newspapers said  would be centred around the slogan  britain is working . a labour party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for mr blair  but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in february. most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 may. the last election was in june 2001.
politics,blair stresses prosperity goals tony blair says his party s next manifesto will be  unremittingly new labour  and aimed at producing  personal prosperity for all .  the prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with gordon brown with the speech in chatham  kent. he is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring  radically improved  public services. he is also claiming labour is more ideologically united than ever. mr brown is currently touring africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with downing street.  with the election widely predicted for may  angry labour mps this week warned mr blair and mr brown about the dangers of disunity. now mr blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of labour s platform for a third term in government. labour made low inflation  unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.  and on thursday mr blair is saying:  i want to talk about the central purpose ofnew labour - which is to increase personal prosperity and well-being  not justfor a few but for all.  by prosperity i mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies  and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state.   the tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. on wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and mr brown under the words  how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other   michael howard and frontbencher john redwood on thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. they say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make britain more competitive.  the liberal democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. the latest speculation about relations between new labour s two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book  brown s britain by robert preston. in it he alleges that mr blair told mr brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. the book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him. mr peston s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair:  there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe.  on wednesday mr blair directly denied mr brown made that quote  and before he left for africa on tuesday the chancellor told reporters:  of course i trust the prime minister.

sport,uefa approves fake grass uefa says it will allow european matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season.  european football s governing body made the decision at a meeting of its executive committee on wednesday. uefa explained that the move  follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces.  they can be used subject to complying with uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory. luton  preston  queens park rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but  after a two-year study  uefa insists the surfaces have moved on. international matches can also be played on such pitches  although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass. uefa spokesman rob faulkner said:  people in england have bad memories of the artificial pitches of luton and qpr in the 1980s  but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass.  we have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards.  several leading clubs from scandinavia  russia and eastern europe - especially those who only play champions league or uefa cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches.
sport,desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday.  the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000.  things will be totally different this time   he told bbc sport.  now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona.  chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1  courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg  going down to strikes from rivaldo (2)  luis figo  dani and patrick kluivert.  former chelsea captain desailly  who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar  says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team  who are top of the premiership.  mentally they are much stronger  even though a lot of their players are young   the 36-year-old said.  we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes.  it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality.  world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for £4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success.  the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman  the manager and all the players   he said.   everything is new and there is a huge determination to win.  since that game in 2000  chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season.  desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france  the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan  two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar  alongside the likes of frank lebeouf  josep guardiola  titi camara  gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta.  i m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level   he said.  i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays  i will continue to play.  and it s amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.
sport,johnson announces june retirement former england captain martin johnson has announced he is to retire from rugby union at the end of the season.  johnson  who captained england to world cup glory in 2003  will play his final match in june. johnson won 84 england caps and quit test rugby at the start of 2004  just two months after leading sir clive woodward s team to victory in sydney. the 34-year-old leicester lock s final match will be his testimonial at twickenham on 4 june.  i m confident i have made the right decision to retire   said johnson.  i m sure there will be times next season when i ll wish i was out there playing for the tigers  but you know when the time is right to go and i feel this is the right time.  i feel physically that i could play for another season  but playing week in and week out in the premiership is a full-time occupation and i only want to be out there for the right reasons.  johnson will always be revered by england fans for captaining england to their dramatic world cup win against australia in sydney  but his list of achievements does not stop at that.  he is the only man to captain the lions twice and he also led england to a six nations grand slam. johnson also had huge success as captain of leicester  guiding the tigers to back to back heineken cup victories and several premiership titles. apart from his marvellous captaincy johnson was also one of the finest second rows to ever play the game. teak tough and physically intimidating  he ruled the rucks and mauls for the best part of a decade and was integral in england s rise to the top of the world game. his final appearance will be in his testimonial at twickenham  where he will lead a team against a side captained by new zealand winger jonah lomu. the all black is aiming to return to action after a kidney transplant and johnson expects it to be a memorable occasion.  this game against jonah will be a great way to end the season and end my career   said johnson. lomu  rugby union s first global superstar after his exploits in the 1995 world cup  said he was proud to be part of johnson s farewell.  we hold him in such high esteem   said lomu.  he is such a great leader and i am just honoured to be on the same pitch.
sport,gerrard plays down european hopes steven gerrard has admitted that liverpool have little chance of winning the champions league this season.  the 24-year-old reds skipper spoke out ahead of tuesday s first leg at home to bayer leverkusen in the last 16  which he will miss through suspension.  let s be realistic  there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league   he told bbc radio five live.  we are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year.  gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in europe s premier club competition.  last season he described qualification for the champions league as the  be all and end all  - and rumours persist that he will leave anfield if the reds fail to secure a place in the competition. he has consistently been linked with a move away from liverpool  with chelsea the favourites to snap up the england midfielder. and blues boss jose mourinho backed gerrard s view that rafael benitez s team could struggle to progress this season.  rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team  maybe he s a little bit behind (right now)   he told bbc radio five live.  gerrard  who fired liverpool into the last 16 of this season s competition with a brilliant goal in december s win over olympiakos  insisted he was still fully focused on helping liverpool to glory this season. the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table  five points off the crucial fourth spot  which brings champions league qualification - and they face chelsea in sunday s carling cup final.  it s big couple of months for liverpool   he added.  we re fighting for the fourth spot for the champions league for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions  which are very important.  we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because  financially  it is big for the club and  personally for myself  it is very good.
politics,observers to monitor uk election ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run.  the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice  the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election.  junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said:  i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.  the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout  which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.  but trial all-postal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges  on a scale not seen since the 19th century . thursday s report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the department for constitutional affairs (dca). it said that  with the growth of postal voting  there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually  rather than by household. it also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.  figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24  and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration  as opposed to registration by household  should be quickly introduced as it could  dramatically reduce the chances of fraud . but his counterpart on the dca committee  alan beith  said it should be delayed  until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.  shadow constitutional affairs secretary oliver heald accused the government of  dragging its feet  over  this badly needed measure .  it is vital that we move ahead with the northern ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the britain s electoral system   he said.  the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in 2002. the report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters  but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. it said incentives to register  such as £20 council tax rebate  were likely to be seen as  gimmicks  and risked undermining the integrity of the system  mps said. instead they called for  imaginative campaigns  to boost interest.
politics,terror suspects face house arrest uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.  it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. charles clarke s planned  control orders  mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest  curfews or tagging. the law society dubbed mr clarke s new proposals an  abuse of power . deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on 11 september 2001. mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria  tunisia  egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death.  under the proposed changes - prompted by the house of lords ruling - the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported  to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.  british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. human rights lawyer clive stafford-smith said the plans were a  further abuse of human rights in britain .  mr clarke said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.  he told mps:  there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.  he accepted the law lords  ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat  he told mps.  there have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change.  he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources  lives at risk. most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison  in london. conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens. he warned:  throughout history  internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates.  so unless the process is clearly just  the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists.  he suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.  liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be  very high indeed  and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. shami chakrabarti  from human rights group liberty  joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. she said:  adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. the government should not swap one human rights  opt out  for another.
politics,eu referendum question unveiled the question to be asked in the referendum on the eu constitution has been unveiled by the government.  it will be:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum  expected in 2006. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe  but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu.  if we reject this treaty  britain will be isolated and weak in europe   said foreign secretary jack straw  who along with the rest of the cabinet  will back a  yes  vote.  patriots by definition wanted the uk to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad  mr straw said.  our role as a leading member of the eu is a crucial part of securing that.   conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question  seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution  when they should be treated as  two separate issues . despite this  underhand trick   the referendum bill stood  no chance of becoming law before the election   he added.  this is tony blair s cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win.  neil o brien  director of anti-constitution group vote no  said:  the reality is that the government doesn t want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.   the uk independence party said:  if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union  they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu. then we can be out of it and better off much sooner.   liberal democrat leader charles kennedy  who backs the constitution  said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  the sooner we get on with this  the better.  he said the question sounded  very neutral  and  balanced   adding it would enable the argument  to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides . green mep caroline lucas welcomed tony blair s  courage in keeping his word  on holding a referendum. but she added:  this treaty is a flawed document that will make the eu less accountable  less sustainable  and less just.   mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november  but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. that promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. jack straw  who argues the constitution reflected a  british vision for europe  and gives  national governments a stronger grip   has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. but in an interview with the financial times  mr blair refused to be pinned down to that date  saying britain would hold a poll  some time in 2006 but when  i don t know . the paper said the prime minister  claimed ignorance  of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.
sport,holmes urged to compete at worlds jolanda ceplak has urged britain s kelly holmes to continue competing at the major championships.  double olympic gold medallist holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year s worlds and is undecided about next month s european indoors. but world indoor 800m record holder ceplak said:  there is never an easy race when she is in the field. there is only excitement at what might happen.  it is good for the sport. she always fetches the best out of everyone.  ceplak has been a great rival of holmes  during the briton s career and the pair fell out when holmes questioned the manner of the slovenian s runaway 800m victory at the 2002 european championships. but the controversy has since been forgotten  with ceplak acting as pacemaker for holmes  failed attempt on the british indoor 1500m record at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham in 2003.  ceplak added:  i like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast.  that is the sort of competition that i like. she is special to me. she was like my idol from the beginning of my career.  meanwhile  ceplak will be looking to follow up last saturday s win in boston with a fast time and victory in friday s night of athletics in erfurt  germany. britain s jason gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in leipzig on sunday. gardener s decision means scotland s 400m man ian mackie will carry british hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend s norwich union european trials in sheffield.
sport,chepkemei hit by big ban kenya s athletics body has suspended two-time london marathon runner-up susan chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year.  athletics kenya (ak) issued the ban after chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in embu.  we have banned her from all local and international competitions   said ak chief isaiah kiplagat.  we shall communicate this decision to the iaaf and all meet directors all over the world.  the 29-year-old finished second to paula radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 london races  and was also edged out in an epic new york marathon contest last year.  but the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging radcliffe at this year s london event in april. global sports communications  chepkemei s management company  said she had wanted to run in the world cross country championships in march. but ak maintained it was making an example of chepkemei as a warning to other kenyan athletes.  we are taking this action in order to salvage our pride   said kiplagat.  we have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us.  ka has also threatened three-time women s short-course champion edith masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. masai missed the national trials in early february  but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. she failed to run in the event  citing a leg injury.
sport,greek pair attend drugs hearing greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.  they were given provisional suspensions by athletics  ruling body the iaaf in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. the pair arrived with former coach christos tzekos to give evidence at the hellenic olympic committee s offices. a decision is expected to be announced before the end of february. whatever the ruling  all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. yiannis papadoyiannakis  who was head of the greek olympic team at the athens games last year  also testified at the tribunal  along with other greek sports officials and athletes.  i believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution   said papadoyiannakis.  whatever the athletes have done  we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.  kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 sydney olympics  while thanou won silver in the 100m.  they withdrew from the athens games last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. the pair spent four days in a hospital  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. the five-member tribunal  assembled by the hellenic association of amateur athletics  is also examining allegations that kenteris and thanou avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games. tzekos was also banned for two years by the iaaf. he faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. all three  who have repeatedly denied the allegations  have also been charged by a greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. a trial date has not been set. in imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 december  the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as  unacceptable . but kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing.  we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical   he said.  there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials  and these procedural breaches have also violated my client s rights.  there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.
politics,blair  said he would stand down  tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election  a new book about the chancellor claims.  but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet  according to the book. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other. the book  brown s britain  said tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust.  the author s sources  all unnamed  allies  of mr blair and mr brown  said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party.  the book  serialised in the sunday telegraph  alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november 2003 of his intention to stand down.  at that stage he saw gordon brown and said   look you are the next most influential member of the government  i need your help to get through the next year   mr peston said.  i myself recognise that i m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.   but he changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  the book claims.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair s monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster.  former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv s sunday programme.   what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out   the labour mp for birkenhead asked. he said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron  mp for witney  added:  if it wasn t so serious it would be funny.  but it is serious - you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime  poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other.  carol walker  bbc news 24 political correspondent  added:  there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign.  and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.

sport,campbell to extend sprint career darren campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting.  campbell  who won olympic 4x100m relay gold  had been unsure about his future. but he told five live s sportsweek:  i had to get back into training before i could decide because if i didn t have the same hunger i d have to walk away.  i ve started back and i m thoroughly enjoying it. i m looking forward to it. i ve got to run under 10 seconds (for 100m) and under 20 seconds (for 200m).  campbell was part of the british quartet who shocked the americans to win relay gold in athens in august.  the newport-based athlete and team-mates jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis were rewarded with mbes in the new year honours list. campbell s relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in athens  when he failed to reach the finals. the 31-year-old  who won olympic 200m silver in sydney in 2000  said during the games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.  he was criticised at the time by former olympic champion michael johnson  who cast doubt on campbell s injury claims.  to go to athens and finally get the gold i ve been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief   said campbell.  it was a chance for me to prove that if i d been fit i would have been challenging for the (individual) medals.  every season i go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different   it s just unfortunate that i picked up that injury just before the olympics.  campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the european title in budapest in 1998. and he ran 20.13secs in the quarter-finals of the 200m in sydney on the way to olympic silver.
sport,mourinho takes swipe at arsenal chelsea boss jose mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals arsenal ahead of the gunners facing newcastle on wednesday.  arsenal will play the magpies a day after chelsea beat portsmouth during a busy festive programme. and mourinho said:  they always seem to have two or three days  rest in which to recover. perhaps it s something to do with the television schedule.  all my players are tired  especially john terry.   chelsea boss jose mourinho admitted his side were  lucky  to win at fratton park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such a short space of time during this time of year. he added:  we have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and  although i understand the traditions of football here at this time of year  it is not good for your health to do it.   you can sit back and smoke cigars  one after another  and it is a good life  but it is not actually good for you.  playing so many games is certainly not healthy  especially for teams who still have european commitment.
sport,capriati to miss melbourne jennifer capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the australian open because of injury.  the organisers of the first grand slam of 2005  which begins on 17 january  said the american has a problem with her right shoulder. it comes as a blow to the women s draw as last year s champion  justin henin-hardenne  and runner-up  kim clijsters  will also be absent. capriati is a two-time champion in melbourne with wins in 2001 and 2002. she is believed to have picked up the injury at the advanta championships at philadelphia in november and had to pull out of an exhibition match with wimbledon champion maria sharapova on 17 december. capriati also decided against competing in the australian open warm-up event  the sydney international.
politics,milburn defends poster campaign labour s election chief alan milburn has defended his party s campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of  sly anti-semitism .  mr milburn said he appreciated people s concerns  but insisted that  what they were was anti-tory  and  not in any way  shape or form anti-semitic . he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.  a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard  who is jewish  as fagin  and as a flying pig  amid claims they were anti-semitic. the posters were labelled a  big misjudgement  by the conservatives who said labour s  first shot in the election has badly backfired .  the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members  who were asked to vote on their favourite. labour has taken them off its website  saying members preferred other posters. the party s four new designs  launched on tuesday  steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images  but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally  with reminders of his record in office.  the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members  who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. in the commons  tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a  21st century fagin .   given the outrage that that smear caused then  how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-semitism   mr milburn replied that they were not anti-semitic.  what they were was anti-tory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean   he said.  i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website.  the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour s website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5. a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party s website was not affected by the row.
sport,o leary agrees new villa contract aston villa boss david o leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on thursday  securing his future at the club until summer 2008.  o leary s future was in question  but villa chairman doug ellis said he was happy to secure the deal.  david s record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board s amibitions in taking this club forward   he told villa s website.  for this reason it was important we got this right.  o leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men roy aitken and steve mcgregor.  it was important to me roy and steve  an integral part of my team  should stay for the same time   o leary said on thursday ahead of signing his new deal.  someone has to try and put aston villa back where they should belong and i m up for the challenge. earlier in december  there were rumours o leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.  but he denied that  saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving villa s fortunes in the long term.  i want to make sure by the end of the five years i would have been in charge that villa are achieving top six finishes in the premiership on a regular basis   said o leary  who took over at villa park in may 2003.  but to achieve that  and take the next step forward  we do need to bring in quality players.  i would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.  meanwhile  o leary has rapped skipper olof mellberg for his comments before sunday s derby with birmingham.  mellberg spoke of his dislike of villa s rivals ahead of the match  which steve bruce s side won 2-1.  i ve had more than a quiet word with olof. it s been said within the whole group  not as a one-to-one   he told villa s website.  you shouldn t leave yourself open to be shot down. you shouldn t give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.
politics,hospital suspends  no welsh  plan an english hospital has suspended plans to stop treating welsh patients who have waited more than three months.  hereford county hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. gps in wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. but after talks with powys health board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in january. hereford hospital trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. shocked health officials in powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. andy williams  chief executive of powys local health board  had said it was  a totally unacceptable way to behave .  mr williams had said he did not think it was a welsh-english issue  but said hereford hospital was  struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to powys . he had told bbc radio wales:  i have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients i am paying them to treat.  but after the hospital had agreed to the suspension  mr williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure welsh patients continued to be treated there. he said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between england and wales.  the target is 12 months for welsh patients  but just three months in england. the contract with the powys health board was worth £7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients. in a statement before the suspension of the idea  the welsh assembly government said the situation was  unacceptable .  but powys local health board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate   said the assembly government.  although we will be challenging hereford s decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients. they will be contacted by their gps in the next week.  earlier  david rose  chief executive of hereford hospitals nhs trust  had said:  it is with real regret that we have taken this step.  we want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service.  in 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital.  we appeal to powys local health board to allow powys people to choose hereford for their treatment.
politics,debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
sport,lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship.  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand.  i don t think you can ever say never   said woodward.  but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.  dallaglio  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.
sport,moya sidesteps davis cup in 2005 carlos moya has chosen not to help spain try and defend the davis cup crown they won in seville in november.  moya led spain to victory over the usa but wants to focus on the grand slams in 2005  although insists he will return to the davis cup in 2006.  after two years of total commitment with the davis cup team... i have taken this difficult decision to concentrate on the regular circuit   said moya.  they know that after this season they can count on me again if they so wish.  the 1998 french open champion is determined to make an impact in the major events after spending much of the last eight years in the top 10.  at the age of 29 i have set some tough goals in my professional career and this season i need to fix my objectives on specific dates and tournaments   he said.  since the davis cup in seville i have been working on my condition as well as technical and medical aspects of my game which will allow me to come into the big events of the year in top form.   moya began 2005 with victory in the chennai open on sunday.
sport,woodward eyes brennan for lions toulouse s former irish international trevor brennan could be one of clive woodward s many surprises when the 44-man lions tour squad is announced.  brennan  who last played for ireland against samoa in 2001  is held in high esteem by the former england coach.  if you speak to the players there s a huge amount of respect for the guy   woodward told the sunday independent.  players tend to know better than most coaches. it s not just the irish  but welsh and english players as well.  the 31-year-old former dublin milkman moved from leinster to toulouse in 2003 and immediately picked up a heineken cup winner s medal in an all-french final against perpignan at lansdowne road.  brennan is highly-rated at stade toulousain  where he is used anywhere in the back five. woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to new zealand in june are as thorough as possible.  i ve spoken to quite a few players  and they probably don t know what they re actually saying when we re having these conversations   he told the newspaper.  but you talk about certain players and they ll say if they think they re up to scratch or that they don t want them in their team.  i haven t heard a bad word said against trevor  which  considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation  is  to me  impressive.
sport,wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal-kicker jonny wilkinson  according to his newcastle boss rob andrew.  wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 february match for his international comeback - has been missed by england  not least for his goal-kicking.  jonny s not fit yet   falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live.  he won t be fit for dublin  there s no doubt about that  but he might be fit for scotland and italy.  the 25-year-old has not played for england since the 2003 world cup final after a succession of injuries. england  who have lost three six nations games in a row  wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to france. goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them.  they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley   added andrew  a former england fly-half and goal-kicker.   they re both pretty good kickers. charlie is a good kicker week-in  week-out.  but it s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment.  andrew also blamed england s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries.  they just didn t have that leadership that would have seen them through. martin johnson  lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations   he said.  i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.  meanwhile  former england full-back dusty hare put england s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.   jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate   hare told bbc radio five live.  but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do.  you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.  hodgson  who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks  has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.  the top golfers don t hit the fairway every time  and it is the same with goal-kicking   hare added.  you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over  but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely.
sport,fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson said he was  livid  after his side were denied two tries in sunday s 19-13 six nations loss to ireland in dublin.  mark cueto s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes.  [i m] absolutely spitting. i m livid. there s two tries we ve been cost   robinson told bbc sport.  we ve got to go back to technology. i don t know why we didn t.  south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather.  kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try.  i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey   said robinson.  it is how we use the technology. it is there  and it should be used.   i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both  and they both looked tries.  we are very disappointed  and this will hurt  there is no doubt about that.  we are upset now  but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that.   we did everything we could have done to win the game. i am very proud of my players and  with a couple of decisions  this could have been a very famous victory.  i thought we dominated. matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop  while the likes of charlie hodgson  martin corry and lewis moody all came through well.  josh lewsey was awesome  and every one of the forwards stood up out there. given the pressure we were under  credit must go to all the players.  we have done everything but win a game of rugby  but ireland are a good side. they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations.  england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.
politics,goldsmith:  i was not leant on  the attorney general has again denied being  leant on  by downing street to make the legal case for invading iraq.  claims a written answer on the legality of the war was drafted by downing street were  wholly unfounded   he insisted during stormy lords exchanges. lord goldsmith said the answer represented his  genuinely held independent view  the war was legal. the text was released on the eve of a crucial commons vote in which mps backed the invasion of iraq. many labour mps have since indicated that the attorney general s answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential. in the house of lords  the attorney general faced a call by former tory lord chancellor lord mackay to now publish the  full text  of the advice - the suggestion was rejected. another peer meanwhile  lord skidelsky  said not to publish the full legal opinion would  strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption  in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction .  last week lord goldsmith said in a statement:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.  no other minister or official was involved in any way.   as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   tony blair has dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he [lord goldsmith] said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue. on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  a book published by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this.
politics,howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.
politics,uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.  home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison  london  and woodhill  milton keynes  was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria  tunisia  egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.  mr clarke told the times:  i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.  he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw  in a very positive way . mr clarke said that he was seeking  memorandums of understanding  between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however  he added:  i do not think the solution to the law lords  judgement for this government is in deportations  but they will help.  there are other strands that we have to do.  but the liberal democrat s shadow home secretary  mark oaten  accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees.   the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle  to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future   he told bbc news.  and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing  for example  intercept communications  telephone tapping to be included   mr oaten said.  deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.   unless we get that  the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march.   the bbc s home affairs correspondent  daniel sandford  said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor  david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees  home countries could be difficult.  some of these people are accused of very  very serious crimes in their home countries so it s not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won t be the solution.  daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks.  the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial   he said.
sport,france v wales (sat) stade de france  paris  saturday  26 february  1600 gmt  bbc1  radio 4 lw and this website  france may have beaten scotland and england but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches. wales  on the other hand  have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. they also have a good record at the stade de france  having won their first two games there  in 1999 and 2001. wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed italy 38-8 in rome.  kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing. in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the wales back row in place of jonathan thomas. wales coach mike ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship.  graham henry (former wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should  be bold  when going to france  and he was proved right   said ruddock.  that is a great way to approach the game  and something we will further endorse with the players this week.   despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions france are also unbeaten. under-pressure coach bernard laporte has made four changes  with yannick nyanga  the debutant julien laharrague  aurelien rougerie and yannick jauzion coming into the side. france have been criticised for the absence of traditional  french flair  as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain fabien pelous sees hope on the horizon.  i get the impression we are getting better   he said.  against wales  which is different from the teams we have beaten  i hope we can show our proper game.   j laharrague; a rougerie  y jauzion  d traille  c dominici; y delaigue  d yachvili; s marconnet  s bruno  n mas; f pelous (capt)  j thion; s betsen  y nyanga  j bonnaire (bourgoin).  w servat  o milloud  g lamboley  i harinordoquy  p mignoni  f michalak  j-p grandclaude.  g thomas (capt); k morgan  t shanklin  g henson  s williams; s jones  d peel; g jenkins  m davies  a jones; b cockbain  r sidoli; r jones  m williams  m owen.  r mcbryde  j yapp  j thomas  r sowden-taylor  g cooper  c sweeney  r williams.
sport,clijsters could play aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january s australian open because of her persistent wrist injury.  open chief paul mcnamee had said:  kim s wrist obviously isn t going to be rehabilitated.  but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry.  the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. but if there s the least risk she will stay away.  despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament  which begins on 17 january  clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. meanwhile  jelena dokic  who used to compete for australia  has opted out of the first grand slam of the season. dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. four-time champion monica seles  who has not played since last year s french open  is another absentee because of an injured left foot.
sport,radcliffe will compete in london paula radcliffe will compete in the flora london marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005.  the 31-year-old won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut  defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 april race.  it doesn t get any better than this for the 25th anniversary   said race director david bedford.  after announcing the greatest men s field ever we now have the greatest women s distance runner ever.  three years ago radcliffe smashed the women s world record in two hours 18 minutes 15 seconds.  the bedford star returned to london 12 months later  lowering her mixed-race world record of 2:17:18  which she set in chicago in october 2003  by one minute 53 secs. radcliffe s career took a setback when she failed to complete the olympic marathon and later dropped out of the athens 10 000m last august. but the 31-year-old bounced back to win the new york marathon in november. radcliffe  however  passed up the chance to go for the  big city  marathon grand slam. with wins in chicago  london and new york  only the boston marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after london.  boston is definitely a race i want to do at some point  but london is very special to me   said radcliffe.  i don t pick races thinking about things like pressure. i pick the ones in my heart i really want to do.  i love the atmosphere  crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race.  it is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.
politics,eu referendum could cost £80m  it could cost £80m to run a uk referendum on the european constitution  ministers have revealed.  in a written parliamentary answer  constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum  held 30 years ago. ministers say the constitution would make the european union work better but critics fear creating a  super state . labour mp john cryer  whose question revealed the price estimate  said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. but he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. the 2001 election cost £80m. no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. most voters said the uk should stay in the common market in the 1975 referendum.
sport,chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury.  thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas  knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and  with his back to goal  henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch  turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes.  gunners keeper manuel almunia  who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann  did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately  henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and  given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly  henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall.  this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia.  arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  fabregas  reyes (clichy 82)  bergkamp (van persie 82)  henry. subs not used: senderos  hoyte  lehmann.  cole.  henry 2  29.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho (drogba 45)  terry  gallas  duff  tiago (bridge 45)  makelele  lampard  robben  gudjohnsen (parker 77). subs not used: kezman  cudicini.  robben  drogba  lampard.  terry 17  gudjohnsen 46.  38 153  g poll (hertfordshire).
sport,mido makes third apology ahmed  mido  hossam has made another apology to the egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team.  the 21-year-old told a news conference in cairo on sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the pharaohs since july last year. mido said:  there isn t much i have to say today  all there is to say is that i came specially from england to egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes.  mido was axed by former coach marco tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up  claiming he had a groin injury. but he then played in a friendly for his club as roma within 24 hours of a world cup qualifying match at home to cameroon last september. mido added:  it s not my right to give orders and say when i want to play ... at the same time i will always make sure that i put the national s team s matches as my top priority.  i feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as i saw them play against belgium (egypt won 4-0 on wednesday) and i simply want to add to their success.  i do confess that i was rude to the egyptian press at times but now i have gained more experience and know that i will never go anywhere without the press s support.  many of the international stars like david beckham and (zinedine) zidane had the press opposing them.  so i m now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and i don t have to overreact when this happens. meanwhile  egypt fa spokesman methat shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on mido to apologise.  mido s apology today does not negatively affect mido in anyway  on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players   shalaby said. shalaby earlier said that after an apology mido would be available for the national side if coach hassan shehata chose him. mido joined tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the january transfer window  scoring twice on his debut against portsmouth.
sport,mourinho receives robson warning sir bobby robson has offered chelsea boss jose mourinho some advice on coping under pressure.  the pair worked together at barcelona and porto and robson had a word of warning for his protege.  it has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous  but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose   said robson.  it is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn  and he ll get it straight.  robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of newcastle.  jose is doing very well at the moment   robson added of the man who worked for him for six years.  he has got one pot - possibly two to follow - a big game against barcelona to come and i cannot see them losing their lead in the premiership.  they are in a good position and i would expect them to go on and win it  which is a wonderful achievement.   what has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future. if he is intelligent  he will take it on board - and he is very intelligent.  he will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months. before that  it was all about winning.  robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against mourinho.  i am not in a hurry to take the wrong job  but i am ready to take the right job and i feel there is another job in me   he added.  i know the area i am capable of working in and of course i would like a job in the premiership if one was available.  it would not worry me if i had to pit my wits against jose.  but it is not just a case of him and me against one another. it would be his team against my team - but i would not be afraid of that.
sport,bellamy fined after row newcastle have fined their welsh striker craig bellamy two weeks  wages - about £80 000 - following his row with manager graeme souness.  but bellamy  25  has not been put on the transfer list  although he did not train with the first team on tuesday. magpies chairman freddy shepherd told the newcastle evening chronicle:  it is not about money. it is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club.  no individual is  be it the chairman  the manager or a player.  souness dropped bellamy for sunday s game against arsenal  claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position.  when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock   bellamy said.  i thought  not only has he gone behind my back  he s lying    he said in response to souness  remarks. and the wales international refused to apologise.  i won t apologise because i have done nothing wrong   he told the evening chronicle.  there s no doubt about it  i am out of here.  the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend  and has led to a war of words in the media.  bellamy s claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by shepherd  who accused the striker of  cheating  the club.  i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation   said shepherd.  craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on friday)  but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury.  when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend a meeting in my office.  at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and i that he had told the players that he was going to  fake  an injury in training and walk off.  he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. he didn t do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend  which i fully support.  in my book this is cheating on the club  the supporters  the manager and his own team-mates.  he is paid extremely well and i consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.   bellamy s latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold  bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request.  i don t want the fans to think for one minute that i wouldn t play for this club   he said.  i d play anywhere for this club  even in goal.  it s a very difficult situation for me at the moment but i d never ask to leave this club.  this club means so much to me. i couldn t do it because i know i couldn t come back here and play against newcastle. it would hurt too much.
politics,baron kinnock makes lords debut former labour leader neil kinnock has officially been made a life peer during a ceremony in the house of lords.  he will be known baron kinnock of bedwellty - after his former constituency. lord kinnock - who led labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of britain s eu commissioners. a former critic of the house of lords  he has said he will use the upper house to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education.  i accepted the kind invitation to enter the house of lords as a working peer for practical political reasons   he said when his peerage was first announced.  it is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education  sustainable transport  industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns  particularly poverty and oppression.  during his induction into the upper house  lord kinnock was accompanied by lords leader baroness amos and baroness royall of blaisdon  a former aide to the ex-labour leader. it has been a long journey for the new lord kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south wales valleys. born in 1942 in tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother  he attended lewis boys  school in nearby pengam  known then as the  eton of the valleys . from there he went to cardiff university  where he met his future wife glenys  now a labour mep.  after a brief career as a tutor for the workers  educational association  he became an mp at the age of just 28 for his home seat of bedwellty (later islwyn). he gained a reputation as a left-wing firebrand  voting against his own labour government s spending cuts proposals in 1975  and later rejecting a junior post in james callaghan s administration. but he joined the shadow cabinet in 1980  and after labour s heavy defeat in the 1983 he was elected leader. he took on the far-left militant tendency and began the long process of returning his party to the centre ground. he was not expected to win the 1987 election  when margaret thatcher was still riding high  but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to john major  and stepped down. he remained an mp until 1995  when he resigned to become european commission for transport. four years later he became vice-president of the european commission  with responsibility for internal reform. as he assumes the title of lord kinnock  he has also become chairman of the british council  which promotes the uk s reputation for arts  science and education.
politics,plan to give elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.  ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves  not social workers  should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents  calls for free long-term care.  there are 1.7m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. monday s consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said:  this document is the antithesis of the nanny state.   it s about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more.  the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been  disappointing .  ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. they also want to set up a new  half-way house  where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that  individual budget . the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas  such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses. he ruled out free personal care in england - which is on offer in scotland and wales  saying it was  unsustainable .  david rogers  from the local government association  said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter  president of the association of directors of social services  said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle  but not in practice. its director general  gordon lishman  said:  direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.   the tories say people who pay for three years  long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80 000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.  after eight years of persistent change  dogmatic enforcement of regulation  and overbearing government initiatives - we need action  not a vision   said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over £100 000. health spokesman paul burstow said:  promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.  but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.
sport,robben sidelined with broken foot chelsea winger arjen robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.  robben had an mri scan on the injury  sustained during the premiership win at blackburn  on monday.  six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then i need a few more weeks to be completely fit again   he told dutch newspaper algemeen dagblad.  i had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis.  the 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with roma s olivier dacourt. and he added:  it felt different then last summer when i had the same injury on my other foot.  then i could walk already after three days but i stayed sidelined for a long period. i hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks.  chelsea physio mike banks was hopeful that robben could return at some point in march.  the fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month   banks told the club s website.  one is a chip on the side of his foot  the other is a small break on the third metatarsal.  but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months.   david beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 world cup in korea and japan. robben  who has been a key part of the blues  push for four trophies  claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by blackburn midfielder aaron mokoena.  i felt my leg go   he said.  i felt it straight away after mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.
politics,crucial decision on super-casinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament.  the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk  one of which is likely to be in glasgow. scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in scotland. but opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. the vote is due to be taken on wednesday and is expected to be close.  the scottish executive believes that the legislation should be handled by westminster. the new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. a super-casino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre. the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public  have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.
sport,davenport dismantles young rival top seed lindsay davenport booked her place in the last 16 of the australian open with a convincing 6-2 6-4 win over nicole vaidisova of the czech republic.  the american had too much power for her 15-year-old opponent  breaking twice in the first set and once in the second. the german-born vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find a way back after falling behind 3-2 in the opening set. davenport  who closed out with an ace  plays karolina sprem in the next round.  i was fully expecting a tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it   said davenport.  i think she hits some great shots. she made some errors but probably some inexperience played a role in that. but she s so young and obviously has a big game and has many  many years to improve on that.  sprem  the croatian 13th seed  saw off russia s elena likhovtseva 6-3 6-2. former world number one  powered her way into the fourth round with a straight sets win over anna smashnova. the 27th seed from israel stuck with williams until 3-3 in the first set before it became one-way traffic.  the american made 26 unforced errors but was still good enough to romp through the contest in exactly an hour. she reeled off nine straight games to finish a 6-3 6-0 winner.  remains on course to become the first australian to win her home title since chris o neil in 1978. the 10th seed equalled her best performance at a grand slam event when she beat unseeded russian nadia petrova 6-3 6-2 to reach the fourth round. after a tough first set  molik grew in confidence and won in just 56 minutes. she will now meet venus williams.  bring it on   said the 23-year-old.  i played pretty well and it was nice to get through in straight sets.   we were destined to meet  i guess   williams said referring to her match with molik.  it will be a huge match for her in australia. i can tell she s probably very motivated by that so i need to get out there and play well.   beat slovakia s daniela hantuchova in a rollercoaster match. dementieva came through 7-5 5-7 6-4  becoming the seventh russian woman to reach the last 16 in melbourne. the match lasted almost three hours and featured 13 service breaks  including three in the final set when dementieva held her nerve to seal the win. she now faces  after the swiss 12th seed beat american abigail spears 7-6 6-3. french open champion  received a free ride into the last 16 after lisa raymond was forced to withdraw. raymond  the 25th seeded american  was ruled out after sustaining a left abdominal muscle tear in the doubles. myskina  the third seed  now plays france s  who beat francesca schiavone of italy 6-3 6-3.  i m extremely disappointed because i couldn t have asked to play better in my first two matches   raymond said.
sport,classy henman makes winning start tim henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over argentine david nalbandian at the kooyong classic exhibition tournament on wednesday.  the british number one will next play roger federer at the australian open warm-up event on friday. the world number one beat gaston gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4  before andre agassi saw off chilean olympic gold medalist nicolas massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). andy roddick beat ivan ljubicic  who replaced paradorn srichaphan  6-1 6-4. henman made an impressive start to the year  only faltering against nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. but the briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the argentine.  it s a great start to the year - just what i was looking for   henman told his website.  over the years i ve found david very difficult to play against.   he returns serve very well and he s deceptively effective from the baseline  so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result.  beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year.  henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season.  i m not the most flexible and at the end of the year i was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where i didn t do anything   said henman.  when i started training again it really  really seized up. as much as i enjoyed the two weeks off i don t think it s so productive.  federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 french open champion gaudio  but was content with his game.  it was about getting used to the surface   he said.   the conditions are much quicker than doha  my timing was ok  but i could have served better.  all in all i m happy with the match  and i won it - that s a good sign. now i have a day off and hopefully play better the next match.  agassi was delighted with victory over massu in his first match for over two months.  i felt pretty good   said the american.  i liked the way the match played out and  maybe excluding a few second serve returns  i felt like i was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.

politics,hague  given up  his pm ambition former conservative leader william hague says he will not stand for the leadership again  having given up his ambition to be prime minister.  mr hague  43  told the daily telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too  boring  and unfulfilling. mr hague  who stepped down after his party s 2001 election defeat  does not rule out a return to the front bench. he also told the paper he hopes to remain mp for richmond  north yorks  and start a family with wife ffion. mr hague  who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger  also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.  he told the newspaper:  i don t know whether i will ever go back on to the front  but don t rush me.  asked if he would stand for the leadership again  mr hague replied:  no. definitely not.  his determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior conservative members  who say the party needs him. tim collins  the shadow education secretary  said last week it would be a  huge boost  to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench. mr hague became an mp at 27 and leader of the opposition at 36. he said:  i feel fortunate that  by the age of 40  i had crammed in an entire political career.  i had been in the cabinet and been leader of the party  so now i can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.  mr hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister.  maybe i wasn t as driven by politics as i thought i was   he said.

politics,defiant hunts put ban to the test thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in england and wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.  the countryside alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal  but vowed to stay within the law. although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. one anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in kent.  the man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the east kent hunt  near ashford. in wiltshire  police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. the group  from south wales and ireland  have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.  it is believed more than 270 hunts went out on saturday  just one day after the ban came in.  they were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country  with actor jeremy irons and former minister kate hoey among the supporters. anti-hunt groups - such as the league against cruel sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.  mike hobday  from the league  said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police.  our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law  many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting.  however  we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across britain.  bbc correspondent simon hall at postbridge on dartmoor in the west country said 2 000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.  and the bbc s sarah mukherjee  with the beaufort hunt in badminton  gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt  with 150 on horseback. tom heap  bbc rural affairs correspondent  said it appeared that hunstman had  for now  been sticking to the new rules. and while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on saturday  he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.  before riding out with the hunt  former minister kate hoey told crowds:  we will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.  judith moritz  in melton mowbray  said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of leicestershire  but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. the countryside alliance said the meets would show the new law was  impossibly difficult to determine  and open to different interpretations.  chief executive simon hart said:  there has been hunting in england for 700 years. this [ban] may take two or three years  perhaps two or three months  to unpick.  it will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service  as broadcasters say.  conservative family spokeswoman theresa may said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. suffolk chief constable alastair mcwhirter  the association of chief police officers  spokesman on rural policing  told the bbc the law would be enforced  although the police would not break up hunts. the attorney general lord goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. he said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police  in the near future  to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.
politics,bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.  lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates  courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.  ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims  and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs  plan  lord falconer said:  one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.  the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.   courts  judges  magistrates  prosecutors  police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first  without compromising the rights of the defendant.  he went on:  giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience  especially when you re a victim.  yet with a will and with support it can be done.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts.  you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence   he said.  but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem  it s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.   the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925  as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform  with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday. ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor  but the lords have over-ruled this. lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords  he said  and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. what they did  not what they were called  was the critical issue  he added.
sport,benitez deflects blame from dudek liverpool manager rafael benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper jerzy dudek after portsmouth claimed a draw at anfield.  dudek fumbled a cross before lomana lualua headed home an injury-time equaliser  levelling after steven gerrard put liverpool ahead. benitez said:  it was difficult for jerzy. it was an unlucky moment.  he was expecting a cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like a shot  so i don t blame him for what happened.  benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by liverpool  who followed up their derby defeat against everton with a disappointing draw. he said:  we had many opportunities but didn t score and  in the end  a 1-0 lead was not enough.  if you don t have any chances you have to think of other things  but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players. it was a pity.  we lost two points  but we have one more point in the table. now we have another difficult game against newcastle and we have to recover quickly from that.
politics,nat insurance to rise  say tories national insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election  tory leader michael howard has claimed.  tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labour s manifesto. prime minister s questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too.  the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies  predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an £11bn gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax  argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance  he added:  everyone knows tax will go up under labour: isn t it now clear which tax it would be    mr blair instead hailed labour s achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services.  when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals  that money is not wasted   he said. on the tax questions  he added:  we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.  home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants  with only high-skilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union.  mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration  where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers  would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers  he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a  fantasy island . mr howard read from a letter about the government s own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair said:  all the other countries could not agree on the way forward  nor could the un.
politics,ukip s secret weapon  by any measure  new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner.  this is the man who  some pundits believe  was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton s sensational 1992 comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and  more recently  politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party s not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris  it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics.  so why britain and why ukip which  despite its recent eu election successes  is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject  morris appears almost evangelical.   i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and  coincidentally  so was ukip leader roger knapman.  i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there . but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him  many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art  irrespective of the politics.  i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism . a great soundbite  but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september.  it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better  who don t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined.  that s international bankers  the world trade organisation  the international monetary fund  the world bank and  primarily  the european union .  so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.  the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can t possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do).  it s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying:  before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody  . possibly a very american analogy  but another great soundbite.  the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it .  so is ukip s job to destroy the tories  as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared   no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories  spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.   but it s not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro . and  while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk  mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.  robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one .  so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough   look  we are not going to be forming the next government   he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the 2004 us presidential election  he says  the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so  with limited resources  the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll.  the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it .  anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment.  labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice .  that might  he suggests  lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task  surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour s for the taking. ukip s performance in last year s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all  he has a reputation to sustain.
sport,bell set for england debut bath prop duncan bell has been added to england s 30-man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations.  and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and julian white out with a neck injury  bell could make his england debut. bell  30  had set his sights on an international career with wales. but last december  the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row. but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell - who was among the tryscorers when england a beat france a 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley  who withdrew from bath s starting line-up to face gloucester last weekend.  he was due to have a hospital scan on monday  while gloucester centre henry paul  who started at fly-half against bath  limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem. despite barkley s three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against france  he is expected to retain his place at inside centre  although leicester s in-form prospect ollie smith would be an obvious replacement. bath coach john connolly rates barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the dublin trip. uncapped fly-half andy goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the ireland game  and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during leicester s record 83-10 win against newcastle on sunday. england s players are due to meet at their surrey training base on monday.
politics,blair  damaged  by blunkett row a majority of voters (68%) believe the prime minister has been damaged by the row over david blunkett s involvement in a visa application  a poll suggests.  but nearly half those surveyed said mr blunkett should return to cabinet if labour won the next election. some 63% of respondents in the sunday times poll thought his former lover - kimberly quinn - acted vindictively and 61% that he had been right to resign. yougov polled a weighted sample of 1 981 voters online on 16-18 december. mr blunkett resigned as home secretary on wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by mrs quinn s former nanny had been speeded up. sir alan budd s inquiry also found mr blunkett s account of events had been wrong. almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the sunday times said he should return to the cabinet straight after the election. one in four said he should be back in the government s top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.  three-quarters said mr blunkett was right to go to court for the right to see mrs quinn s son - whom he says he fathered - and just 14% voiced sympathy for mrs quinn. a total of 53% of those polled said they had sympathy for mr blunkett  with 40% saying they did not. forty-three per cent thought mr blunkett had done a good job as home secretary and 17% disagreed. meantime  32% said mr blair was a good prime minister and 38% disagreed. a majority  52%  said chancellor gordon brown had done a good job and just 16% disagreed.  a second poll for the independent on sunday found that support for all political parties remained largely unchanged after the blunkett controversy. labour lead the conservatives by 39% to 34% with the liberal democrats on 19%. communicateresearch interviewed 401 people before david blunkett s resignation and 601 afterwards. some 82% said mr blunkett had set a good example by wanting to take responsibility for the child he says is his  but 42% backed his legal action compared to 45% who thought it was unbecoming. thirty per cent said the affair showed mr blunkett could not be trusted as a minister while 63%  disagreed.
sport,spain coach faces racism inquiry spain s football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry.  if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about £22 000. the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october. but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain s anti-violence commission. aragones insisted the comments  made to henry s arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes  were meant to motivate the player  and were not intended to be offensive.   i never intended to offend anyone  and for that reason i have a very easy conscience   he said at the time.  i m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results.  as part of that job  i use colloquial language  with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world.   england s players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month.  but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england s black players during the game  which spain won 1-0. spain s minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation s decision.  everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations  and make sure they do not give a negative image   he said.  we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism.
sport,mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united.  mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. but an fa spokesman told bbc sport:  we are not taking action over mourinho.  we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it.  mourinho was concerned that ferguson s conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official.  i see one referee in the first half and another in the second   said mourinho.  if the fa ask me what happened  i will tell them. what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things.   maybe when i turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit.  the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. it was fault after fault  dive after dive.  but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him  but there was also someone else.  referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity.  i m hoping he might reconsider his comments  unfortunately this is the nature of the game   said hackett.  i don t want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. for the second leg we have an experienced referee  and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing.  sometimes managers have grounds for comments  and i note that  but a referees integrity has been questioned  that is offensive and should be avoided. mr mourinho should look at the facts.  mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final.  it s 0-0  so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time   he said.  we have exactly the same chance we had before this game.  we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is  a footballing power. it ll be difficult for us  but also for them.

sport,wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute.  the pair s long-running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was  a disgrace . wenger initially refused to bite back  saying only:  i will never answer any questions any more about this man.  but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association. the latest twist in the ferguson-wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss  in an interview with the independent newspaper  discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october. united won 2-0 that day  at old trafford  but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson s clothes covered in soup and pizza. the sides meet again at highbury on 1 february.  in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players  calling them cheats  so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself   ferguson said on saturday.  he ran at me with hands raised saying  what do you want to do about it    to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. it s a disgrace  but i don t expect wenger to ever apologise  he s that type of person.   those allegations were put to wenger after saturday s game at bolton  which arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind chelsea in the title race. at first he said only:  i ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened.  if he has to talk  he talks. if he wants to make a newspaper article  he makes a newspaper article.  he doesn t interest me and doesn t matter to me at all. i will never answer to any provocation from him any more.  he does what he likes in england anyway. he can go abroad one day and see how it is.  but later on saturday  according to the independent  wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction.  i have no diplomatic relations with him   the arsenal boss is quoted as saying.  what i don t understand is that he does what he wants and you (the press) are all at his feet.   the situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month.  the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game. but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game.  now the whole story starts again. i don t go into that game. we play football. i am a football manager and i love football above all ... no matter what people say.  reminded that ferguson called him  a disgrace   wenger added:  i don t respond to anything. in england you have a good phrase. it is  bringing the game into disrepute .  but that is not only after a game  it is as well before a game.   ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice-chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public. but ferguson added:  in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done.  the return is on 1 february and they will come out with another diatribe.  david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here.  meanwhile  the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. during that stormy game in october  united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal s ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle. wenger later accused van nistelrooy of  cheating  and was fined £15 000 and  severely reprimanded  by the football association. ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy s tackle  which earned the dutchman a ban   could have given (cole) a serious injury   but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors.   wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit   he added.  they are the worst losers of all time  they don t know how to lose. maybe it is just manchester united  they don t lose many games to other teams.  we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal s up until last season. in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue.  but to wenger it never happens  it is all some dream or nightmare.
politics,bnp leader nick griffin arrested the leader of the british national party has been arrested as part of a police inquiry following the screening of a bbc documentary.  a party spokesman said nick griffin was arrested on tuesday morning on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred. west yorkshire police confirmed they had arrested a 45-year-old man from outside their area. bnp founding chairman john tyndall was arrested on sunday on the same charge.  in july  the bbc documentary secret agent featured covertly-filmed footage of bnp activists. mr griffin is the twelfth man to be arrested following the documentary. nine men from west yorkshire and another man from leicester have been arrested and freed on bail. seven of the men had been held variously in connection with suspected racially aggravated public order offences  conspiracy to commit criminal damage and possession of a firearm. two men  both from keighley  were arrested in september on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. a 24-year-old man from leicester was detained on monday on suspicion of incitement to commit racial hatred. a bnp spokesperson said mr tyndall  from brighton  was arrested following a speech he made in burnley  lancashire  and was released on police bail.
politics,leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu.  the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks  but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult.  some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession  provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair s official spokesman said:  the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils.  the key issue at this week s council will be that of turkey  but they will also discuss a range of other matters.
sport,liverpool revel in night of glory liverpool manager rafael benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the champions league was  one of the proudest nights of my career.   the reds beat olympiakos 3-1 with a late steven gerrard strike and benitez said:  it was a really great night.  the players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans.  we knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. for liverpool  this result is very  very important.  benitez hailed gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. the reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by gerrard s 20-yard drive. he added:  steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.   i have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us.  i felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters  i cannot thank them enough.  i want to say thank-you to the supporters  they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.  gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the champions league after trailing 1-0 at half-time. he said:  i d be lying if i thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.   we had a mountain to climb  but we have climbed it and credit to everyone.  that was one of the best goals i have scored  i caught it sweet  i haven t caught one like that for ages. it was a massive night for me and the team.  liverpool s win means all four of england s champions league representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time.
sport,a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most.  well  at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction  and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish  and not just with eddie o sullivan s triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to o sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years  but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa  ireland finsihed the year on a high. the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965. that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france  were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. but the big one  of course  was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in o sullivan s mind  perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me  the try of the championship. o sullivan s career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that  but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand.  there can be no doubt that ireland s representation will be the biggest ever  albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. in brian o driscoll and paul o connell  ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon d arcy  whose career began as a teenager back in 1999  finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland  the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament. on the provincial front  leinster  for second year in succession  blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession  it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final  they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel  and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody s guess. ulster  meanwhile  just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game.  ulster  however  took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005  but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side  irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban. that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools  cup success since 1977. the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character  doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985  the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey  coleraine s jonathan hutchinson  and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle.
sport,hewitt falls to dent in adelaide lleyton hewitt suffered a shock defeat to taylor dent in the quarter-finals of the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide on friday.  the top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the american. dent will face juan ignacio chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for jurgen melzer. olivier rochus beat third seed nicolas kiefer 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 and will take on second seed joachim johansson. the swede reached the last four by beating compatriot thomas enqvist 6-3 4-6 6-1.  i felt like i was striking the ball much better   said johansson.   i felt like i had a lot of break chances  i didn t take care of them all  but i broke him four times and he only broke me once.  i felt that was the key to get up in the set early.  hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the australian open  which starts on 17 january.  when you ve been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams  you look at the big picture and what motivates you   said hewitt.  that s the grand slams and melbourne s as big for me as any of the four. even if i don t win sydney next week it s no big deal.
politics,blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may.  the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and  despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll  it has not shifted. over the weeks  there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term. and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust.  and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message. and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties  tax and spend policies.  during the phoney campaign  labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller  slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour s plans was a cut. and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger  cuts .  he was sacked for his gaffe  but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track. a second central argument will be over taxation  with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again. mr brown slaps that aside  claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. as usual  the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum  the war on iraq  law and order and education  for example. but  as ever  it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. and  whatever that outcome  2005 is set to be a far more lively  even bitter campaign than 2001 s non-event.
sport,sprinter walker quits athletics former european 200m champion dougie walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness.  walker had hoped to compete in the new year sprint which is staged at musselburgh racecourse near edinburgh on tuesday and wednesday. the 31-year-old scot was suspended for two years in 1998 after testing positive for nandrolone.  i had intended to race but i m running like a goon   said walker. he told the herald newspaper:  i m not in great shape  after missing about a month of training.  i missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks  and then another week working in america.  if i d had a half-decent mark it might have motivated me more  but i won t be racing.  i still enjoy training  but feel it s time to move on  and concentrate on a career.
sport,greek sprinters  won t run again  the careers of sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are over  says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test.  greek athletics federation boss vassilli sevastis told the country s parliament:  i believe kenteris and thanou won t race again.  the damage to their commercial interests has been done   he added. athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling  while the athletes face a trial in a greek court. greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident. speaking to the greek parliament on tuesday  sevastis said that the evidence sent by the international olympic committee and athletics governing body the iaaf was not strong enough for the greek association to find the sprinters guilty.   we were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with   he said.  so how can you as a greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes   he added. the athletes are technically free to compete while the iaaf reviews its response to the decision to clear kenteris and thanou. but sevastis said:  it does not matter if they are found guilty at the court of arbitration for sport and the current decision is reversed.
politics,brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid.  he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign  and praised his handling of the economy.  writing in the guardian newspaper  mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking.  as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear  labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance  disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education  good health and sustainable communities.  bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was  a warning shot  to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.  it was  as always  coded and careful... but entirely deliberate   was mr marr s assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be  central . mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was  in part  because of mr brown s management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a  centrepiece  of labour s manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a  tough  tough fight  for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking  nothing for granted  ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.
sport,tomlinson stays focused on europe long jumper chris tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the european indoor championships.  the 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in madrid and lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in lanzarote.  it s nothing serious   said his coach peter stanley.  he strained a muscle in his abdomen at the birmingham meeting but is back in full training.  sprinter mark lewis-francis will also not compete in madrid on thursday. the birmingham athlete  who clocked a season s best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in birmingham last week  also prefers to focus his attentions on next month s european indoor championships.  lewis-francis  who was runner-up to british team-mate jason gardener at the europeans three years ago  will continue his training at home. meanwhile  tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in madrid. the middlesbrough athlete jumped a season s best of 7.95m at the birmingham grand prix - good enough to push world indoor champion savante stringfellow into second.

politics,lib dems predict  best ever poll  the lib dems are set for their best results in both the general election and the local council polls  one of their frontbenchers has predicted.  local government spokesman ed davey was speaking as the party launched its campaign for the local elections being held in 37 english council areas. the flagship pledge is to replace council tax with a local income tax. the tories say the lib dems would make people pay more tax and labour says the party s sums do not add up. looking to the coming elections  which are all expected to be held on 5 may  mr davey said:  we are going to be winning more votes and winning more seats.  i think we are going to have the best general election results and local election results we have ever had under [party leader] charles kennedy.  i couldn t think of a stronger endorsement of a leader.
politics,kilroy launches  veritas  party ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to  change the face of british politics  as he launched his new party. mr kilroy-silk  who recently quit the uk independence party  said  our country  was being  stolen from us  by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for  truth  - would avoid the old parties   lies and spin . ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.  mr kilroy-silk promised a  firm but fair  policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime  tax  pensions  health and defence over the next few weeks. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining  an already crowded field on the right of british politics . on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members  damien hockney who is now veritas  deputy leader. ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.  mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had  gone awol  after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections.  while ukip has turned its back on the british people  i shall not   he said.  i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in.  and  unlike the old parties  we shall be honest  open and straight.   mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would  deliver better  as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney  has a moral obligation  if not a legal one  to stand down. its leader  roger knapman  has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.  he has remarkable ability to influence people but  sadly  after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye    he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been  straightforward  in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.  veritas  it s the bnp in an expensive suit!  it s all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming  that  veritas  is a party that doesn t believe in  lies and spin   but the truth of the matter is  its completely useless  due to proportional representation  there is no chance that  veritas  will have any chance in claiming power  and change the two-horse race trend. in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.  i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon!!  good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. let s hope kilroy-silk  ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe. we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu  we need to be at the heart of europe  leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go  not running away from it.  all mouth and trousers. a clown. trouble is  any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term.  whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do  none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england. this new party might gain support from right-wing england  but will have little impact in wales or scotland.  hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better  we can t rely on the usa forever!  at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. the electorate is disillusioned with british politics. kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i ll be voting for him.  both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who  in the overall scheme of things  really cares about their petty tiff   many people believe you kilroy. you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.  the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating. one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.  i ve always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising  egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.  brilliant  about time this country had a plausible party!  having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.  fantastic news. pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s  and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local  european and general elections. robert kilroy-silk s ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters ) worst enemy.  as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk s behaviour. he took a party that was just building up a head of steam  and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d etat  he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better  as far as i am concerned  but in any eventuality  the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.  if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose  we d have ballot papers a mile long! you ve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.  whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership  and like him i am also leaving ukip. i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means. the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states. the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party  rather than a  good old british  name  is this indicative of the man - contradictory  vain and pompous   i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point. british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped. if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.  honestly  who really cares  man with tan leaves party with no plan  to set up party with no idea.  as one of kilroy-silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament.  ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk  but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature.  kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician  in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not. he tried to make it work  but they didn t seem to want to grow up. he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy. good luck to the man  i say.  oh please! this is an amusing irrelevance. there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive  eurosceptic  argument. they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed  more democratic  more dynamic europe union. future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.  the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open  honest and straight. what other politician can claim this. i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. i shall be voting for him.  the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip. kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list. he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament.  i wouldn t write off kilroy-silk. while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment  he s a populist and that s always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters  that seems to be one of the factors in success.  good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.  the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv  could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour. he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. kilroy silk has secured my vote  and many more like me. what s more  i look forward to the day when he claims victory  wrecks the eu  and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!  great stuff. the longer the uk dithers over europe  the richer we in ireland become  as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe. oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.  this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party  ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.  thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election!  it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system  people must work together  and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer  ukip achieved a major advance  partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.  ukip has a wide platform of policies  not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.  if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.  so ukip was good enough for him to lead  not good enough for him to follow!  interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!  every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools  top hospitals  clean and efficient public transport  punishments that fit the crime  limited asylum  a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty  two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues  robert  and your time may have come!  well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it s all flash and no real policy here  let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.  veritas  the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not  the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism  so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that
politics,game warnings  must be clearer  violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing  the trade and industry secretary has said.  patricia hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18-rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on sunday. she is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include  high levels of violence . parents are expected to spend millions on video games as christmas presents.  violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah  who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother  giselle  said her son s killer  warren leblanc  17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating the stefan s murder dismissed its influence and manhunt was not part of its legal case. ahead of sunday s meeting in london  ms hewitt said she was proud of the uk s  vibrant games industry  but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults. roger bennett  head of gaming industry body elspa  said banning violent games would be wrong. he said:  we don t want to go down that route. we have seen that the government is supportive of the industry.  the government is holding a further meeting on friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the british board of film classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer. ms hewitt said:  adults should be treated as adults and children as children. it is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors.   equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children.  video games are different to films or videos  and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do.  we need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement.  her call was backed by culture  media and sport secretary tessa jowell who said:  you wouldn t let your child watch the texas chainsaw massacre. you wouldn t let them go to a strip club.  so you shouldn t let them play an 18-rated game. it s the same principle - adults can make their own informed choices  but children can t always and need to be protected.  anyone convicted of selling an 18-rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to £5 000. rockstar games  the makers of manhunt  has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults.
politics,mps to debate  euthanasia laws  mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia  by the back door .  the bill would give legal force to  living wills   where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. but christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate.  ministers insist the mental capacity bill - for england and wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.  the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf  which could be challenged by doctors. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment. an amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith. ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment. mps could vote on it later on tuesday  during the bill s report stage debate. the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords  before becoming law.  the christian medical fellowship (cmf) and lawyers  christian fellowship (lcf) said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the  back door . peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory  not legally binding.  cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take   he said.  the lcf s andrea williams said there were  too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors . ex-labour minister frank field told bbc two s newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to  do away  with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.  constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting 750 000 people with dementia needed updating. mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened  not changed.  we are against euthanasia  we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law   he said.  doctors are saying they want more clarity. patients are saying they want more clarity.  the making decisions alliance  which includes the alzheimer s society  age concern  mencap and the national autistic society  said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up.  it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity   the alliance said in a statement. the british medical association also backs the bill  saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty. she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.
sport,gronkjaer agrees switch to madrid jesper gronkjaer has agreed a move to atletico madrid from birmingham city.  the 27-year-old winger spent just five months at st andrews following a £2.2m move from chelsea in july after playing for denmark at euro 2004. he is set to move during the january transfer window in a deal rumoured to be about £1.4m  subject to a medical.  we will meet with the player s representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign   said atletico sporting director toni munoz. gronkjaer has been targeted by blues fans and was sarcastically applauded when taken off against everton last month. boss steve bruce had said that he would be happy to let the danish international go if the price was right. he added:  i m not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans  reaction towards him.   he has had a tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to a new club and a different area.  he has been terrific and not missed a day s training and is someone if your daughter brought them home you would be delighted.  it just hasn t quite worked out here for him. but we d like to get back most of what we spent.
sport,collins appeals against drugs ban sprinter michelle collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the north american court of arbitration for sport (cas).  the 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal. she is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. cas has said that a ruling is normally given within four months of an appeal. collins was suspended by the us anti-doping agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the balco investigation. as well as being hit with the ban  collins was stripped of her 2003 world and us indoor 200m titles. the san francisco-based balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport. the company has been accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes.
sport,munster cup tie switched to spain munster s heineken cup quarter-final tie against biarritz on 3 april has been switched to real sociedad s paseo de anoeta stadium in san sebastian.  real s ground holds 32 000 whereas the parc des sports aguilera in biarritz has a capacity of just 12 667. the irish province will be given at least 8 000 tickets.  the decision to move was a difficult one  but as we considered the fans as one of our primary objectives   said biarritz chairman marcel martin.  we hope we will be rewarded as a huge crowd behaving in the best rugby tradition.  the match will be the first heineken cup fixture to be played in spain  and is expected to attract the biggest-ever attendance for a rugby match in the country. ulster were the last irish team to play at the paseo de anoeta stadium where they faced a euskarians side during a pre-season tour in 1998.
politics,guantanamo four questioned the four britons freed from us custody in guantanamo bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative.  moazzam begg  martin mubanga  feroz abbasi and richard belmar were held for three years  accused of al-qaeda links. mr begg s father  azmat  said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was  a hero . the men are being held at london s paddington green police station  where they are expected to be questioned by uk anti-terror officers. but louise christian  the lawyer representing mr abbasi and mr mubanga  said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. before being driven by police from birmingham to london  azmat begg said he was concerned for his son moazzam s mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. as azmat begg arrived at the london police station  there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. police have said they have a duty to investigate the men  who were arrested on their return to the uk. but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said evidence obtained by mi5 while the four were in cuba was  absolutely  inadmissible in uk courts. in an interview with the independent  sir john said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the uk.  he told the newspaper:  if an admission is made  it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence.  the options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. if not they will be released as soon as possible.  the men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. louise christian said that after being  tortured and abused  at guantanamo bay  the men s arrest was unfair and inappropriate. she told bbc news she remained very concerned about their psychological state. gareth peirce  lawyer for mr begg  said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. washington has claimed all four were  enemy combatants  who trained at camps run by al-qaeda. the pentagon says they were freed after the uk government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the us or any of its allies.  the detainees were immediately arrested under section 41 of the terrorism act 2000 when they landed at raf northolt  west london  on tuesday. massoud shadjareh  from the muslim safety forum  said:  what sort of homecoming is this  they are innocent people.  the muslim council of britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help.  we want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family   said iqbal sacranie  secretary general of the council.
sport,redknapp poised for saints southampton are set to unveil harry redknapp as their new manager at a news conference at 1500 gmt on wednesday.  the former portsmouth boss replaces steve wigley  who has been relieved of first-team duties after just one win in 14 league games in charge. redknapp  57  quit his fratton park position on 24 november and vowed:  i will not go down the road - no chance.  pompey coach kevin bond is poised to join redknapp  who will be saints  third boss of the season. redknapp s first game in charge will be at home to middlesbrough on saturday. portsmouth chairman milan mandaric said he was  disappointed  by the news and claimed redknapp had been in talks with southampton for  some time .   it would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time   mandaric said on portsmouth s official website.  i am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed.  according to mandaric  redknapp vowed he would not join their south coast rivals when he left portsmouth.  i said to harry  i hope you don t go to southampton   and he told me  absolutely not    he said.  i m wouldn t say i m bitter  disgusted or angry  just disappointed  but it s harry s life and it s his decision.  redknapp became a cult hero after leading portsmouth into the premiership for the first time  and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. but he left the club claiming he needed a break from football  though many believed he was upset with mandaric s decision to bring in velimir zajec as executive director.  southampton chairman rupert lowe was desperate to give former academy director wigley  who replaced paul sturrock just two games into the season  every chance to succeed at st mary s. but results under wigley have been poor and southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. when redknapp s appointment is confirmed  he will be saints  ninth manager in eight years.
sport,taylor poised for scotland return simon taylor has been named in the scotland squad for saturday s six nations clash with italy.  the 25-year-old number eight made a scoring return for edinburgh at the weekend - his first game in a year for the capital side. taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against ireland in dublin in the 2004 six nations championship.  simon is one of scotland s truly world class players so it is a huge bonus   said team-mate chris paterson.  he brings a whole new dimension to us  especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against italy if he is involved.  taylor has turned out for english side saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.  edinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season s six nations. so taylor played the last 20 minutes of saracens  win over northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against south african super 12 side the cats. scotland coach matt williams is due to name his match-day 22 on thursday. both scotland and italy have lost their opening two six nations games and  just like last season s encounter which italy won  this weekend s game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon.  - m blair (edinburgh)  a craig (glasgow)  c cusiter (borders)  s danielli (borders)  m di rollo (edinburgh)  a henderson (glasgow)  b hinshelwood (worcester)  r lamont (glasgow)  s lamont (glasgow)  d parks (glasgow)  c paterson (edinburgh)  g ross (leeds)  h southwell (edinburgh)  s webster (edinburgh)  - r beattie (northampton)  g bulloch (glasgow  capt)  b douglas (borders)  j dunbar (leeds)  i fullarton (saracens)  s grimes (newcastle)  n hines (edinburgh)  a hogg (edinburgh)  g kerr (leeds)  n lloyd (saracens)  s murray (edinburgh)  j petrie (glasgow)  r russell (london irish)  c smith (edinburgh)  t smith (northampton)  s taylor (edinburgh)  j white (sale).
politics,school sport  is back   says pm tony blair has promised that  sport is back  as a priority for schools.  the prime minister launched a £500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010.  it s an important part of education and it s an important part of health   mr blair said. but the conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours  pe within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.  the latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport  with activities such as yoga and tai chi being options. launching the initiative  mr blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl waverley sports college in southwark  south london. he said:  you ve got to bring back school sport. it s got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. it s still very  very important.   earlier  education secretary charles clarke told bbc news there were at least three areas which needed  a coherent framework  and  dedicated funding . these were training for pe teachers  establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. he added the government had originally pledged  for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education  a week. the proportion was currently at 62%  and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. the money for the initiative will come from a new £500m fund.  the £500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently  the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said:  i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.  he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports  saying that an  anti-competitive sport agenda  had been pursued in recent years. martin ward  of the secondary heads association  said members did not like  ring-fenced funds  and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.
politics,few ready  for information act thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the freedom of information act  due to come into force next month  because of government failures  say mps.  from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from whitehall departments to doctors  surgeries. but an all-party committee said it was  not confident  many would be ready. it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a  lack of consistent leadership .  the act comes into effect in england  wales and northern ireland  on 1 january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies  subject to various exemptions.  but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an  unusually high turnover  of staff within the department  which had  seriously interfered  with its work  said the constitutional affairs select committee. it said  despite four years of preparations  some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. the dca had  failed  to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a  lack of consistent leadership   the mps found. committee chairman alan beith said:  the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information  but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared.  our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca  which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime  has been lacking.  a spokesman for the dca said:  the dca has provided - and will continue to provide - strong  clear leadership.  it has delivered a simple  liberal fees regime  guidance on the act which has been widely praised  and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.
sport,barcelona title hopes hit by loss barcelona s pursuit of the spanish title took a blow on sunday as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at home to atletico madrid.  fernando torres gave athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute. ronaldino wasted a second-half chance to equalise for barca when he put a penalty wide  but torres made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. the defeat  coupled with real madrid s 4-0 win over espanyol on saturday  reduces barca s lead to four points. former everton midfielder thomas gravesen scored his first goal for real in the comfortable victory at the bernabeu. zinedine zidane had opened the scoring before raul bagged a brace. gravesen  who replaced zidane  completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. david beckham  watched by sven-goran eriksson  came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for england s game against holland. england team-mate michael owen came on for raul after 76 minutes with the game already won. real have now won six consecutive primera liga games since coach wanderley luxemburgo took charge.
sport,england 17-18 france england suffered an eighth defeat in 11 tests as scrum-half dimitri yachvili booted france to victory at twickenham.  two converted tries from olly barkley and josh lewsey helped the world champions to a 17-6 half-time lead. but charlie hodgson and barkley missed six penalties between them  while yachvili landed six for france to put the visitors in front. england could have won the game with three minutes left  but hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. it was a dismal defeat for england  coming hard on the heels of an opening six nations loss in wales. they should have put the game well beyond france s reach  but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. a scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against wales and scotland respectively. hodgson had an early opportunity to settle english nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. but a probing kick from france centre damien traille saw mark cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle  yachvili giving france the lead with a kick from wide out.  france twice turned over england ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum  one ben kay charge apart. a spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides  until england refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner  only to botch the subsequent line-out. but england made the breakthrough after 19 minutes  when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. jamie noon took a short pass from barkley and ran a good angle to plough through yann delaigue s flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts.  hodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several french infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. the fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after france full-back pepito elhorga  scragged by lewsey  threw the ball into touch. barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close  but by then england had scored a second converted try. after a series of phases lock danny grewcock ran hard at the french defence and off-loaded out of sylvain marconnet s tackle to lewsey. the industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker sebastien bruno to sprint over. after a dire opening to the second half  france threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation  wing jimmy marlu having already departed injured. yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes.  and when lewis moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half s unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. and after seeing another attempt drop just short  yachvili put france ahead with his sixth penalty with 11 minutes left.  england sent on ben cohen and matt dawson  and after barkley s kick saw christophe dominici take the ball over his own line  the stage was set for a victory platform. but even after a poor scrummage  hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. england threw everything at the french in the final frantic moments  but the visitors held on for their first win at twickenham since 1997.  j robinson (capt); m cueto  j noon  o barkley  j lewsey; c hodgson  h ellis; g rowntree  s thompson  p vickery; d grewcock  b kay; j worsley  l moody  m corry.  a titterrell  a sheridan  s borthwick  a hazell  m dawson  h paul  b cohen.  p elhorga; c dominici  b liebenberg  d traille  j marlu; y delaigue  d yachvili; s marconnet  s bruno  n mas; f pelous (capt)  j thion  s betsen  j bonnaire  s chabal.  w servat  j milloud  g lamboley  y nyanga  p mignoni  f michalak  j-p grandclaude.  paddy o brien (new zealand)
politics,no uk apology  for colonial past the days of britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over  gordon brown has said.  the chancellor  speaking during a week-long tour of africa  said it was time to talk about enduring british values of liberty and tolerance. mr brown has signed a debt relief deal with tanzania which could cost the uk £1 billion. south african president thabo mbeki has attacked british imperialists  saying they treated africans like savages. mr brown said that missionairies had come to africa because of their sense of duty. he added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given britain a greater global reach than any other country. bbc political correspondent mark mardell said britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor s but  never before has he been so outspoken in defending britain s past history .  the uk has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world s foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. on top of the relief deal with tanzania mr brown said the uk would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. under the plan - which could cost the uk £1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health  education and welfare.  we make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us   the chancellor said. mr brown  on a week-long tour of africa  spent two days in tanzania before heading on friday evening to mozambique  a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.  there he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact. the chancellor said he hoped other g8 and european countries would follow suit. the uk has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the uk alone is owed - with the world s poorest nations including tanzania. former international development secretary clare short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.
sport,highbury tunnel players in clear the football association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the arsenal and manchester united game.  arsenal s patrick vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened gary neville before the 4-2 defeat. vieira also clashed with opposing skipper roy keane and referee graham poll had to separate them.  the referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time   said an fa statement. it means united s win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body  whose new chief executive brian barwick was in the highbury stands.   i didn t threaten anybody. they are big enough players to handle themselves   said vieira.  i had a talk with roy keane and that s it. gary neville is a big lad  he can handle himself.  they just played better than us and deserved to win.  neville admitted there had been incidents before the game  but insisted it had not distracted his focus.  there were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you   he said.  especially from players of that calibre  but it s a tough game and we ve been around a long time.  neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match  which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of mikael silvestre for head-butting freddie ljungberg .  i thought it was a horrible game in the first half  and it was not much better in the second   he said.  there is no way that should have happened in a football match.   after the match  keane accused vieira of starting the row.  patrick vieira is 6ft 4in and having a go at gary neville. so i said   have a go at me    he said.  if he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that gary neville is an easy target  i m not having it.  manchester united manager sir alex ferguson added:  vieira was well wound up for it.  i ve heard different stories. patrick vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that.
politics,peers debate crown succession law peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.  labour peer lord dubs  succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. the private member s bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. the fabian society s sundar katwala said the change was  long overdue  and that he expected a  warm response . the political reform group s general secretary told bbc radio 4 s today programme there were some  very out-dated features  at the heart of britain s constitution.   in 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures.  we hope they are warm towards it and don t say this is the wrong time.  he pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. mr katwala added:  this is long overdue. parliament will have to do it eventually  the government  and i hope all of the political parties  might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos.   but he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support  it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. he said he hoped the bill would be a  gentle nudge  to the government and suggested it would  demand a response . the bill  which is in the lords for its second reading  has been adopted by former chief whip ann taylor in the commons. the rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the act of settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for parliament to determine the title to the throne.
sport,ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes  with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers . referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all  he has no public recourse to criticism.  it was the same for simon mcdowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned  there were queries over mark cueto s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end.  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.  but there were many more  and one should not take away from those. brian o driscoll s winning try was as well-conceived as they come  while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick  then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. ireland s second-row colossus paul o connell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about ireland s back-foot display  with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships.
politics,minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and  very clear   alun michael has said.  the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law  which came into force on friday  and pretended they were not. some 270 hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. but anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a  massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting . people had turned out  to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law   he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed  legally  as far as he was aware.  although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable  mr michael told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.  the reality is that the law is very clear. you can t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs  whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer.  if people do so and pretend they re not it s going to become very clear. you can t hunt accidentally.  mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy  the health service and their children s future than hunting.  but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban  with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. there were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act.  they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. but penny little  who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire  said she had witnessed  gratuitous  spiteful killing of foxes . if people tried to  run circles around this law  the only outcome would be that it was tightened up  she said. mike hobday  from the league against cruel sports  said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. but mr jackson  who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire  denied there was any intimidation.
politics,donor attacks blair-brown  feud  the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.  duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its  poor  response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour £50 000. he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.  the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money  although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives.  robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. mr bannatyne said:  disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country.  gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy  but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.  the businessman  whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle  also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq.  and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as  piecemeal and poor .  the people there need practical help not just pledges of money   he said.  the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.  british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon s den. but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt.  in a separate development  robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election. but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not  perceived as a problem by the voters   adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was  not an alternative source of opposition to the government . he warned the  abstentions party  was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an  unremittingly new labour  election manifesto. his comments come after dave prentis  the leader of britain s biggest union unison  told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader.
sport,chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)  john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez s header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too  after mourinho s sending off  apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.  riise could not have connected any better with morientes  cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal  the quickest-ever in a league cup final  stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues  attacking chances were limited  and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard s powerfully-struck drive and drogba s low shot. despite their frustration  chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool s well-organised defence.  joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore  but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless  liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes  first at full stretch from gudjohnsen s header  then to smother william gallas  follow-up. and despite chelsea s possession  it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues  increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho s reaction which saw him sent off  but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman s feet  while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval  drogba made no mistake  picking the ball up from glen johnson s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen s cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level  but despite liverpool s desperate attacks  chelsea clung on to win.  dudek  finnan  carragher  hyypia  traore (biscan 67)  luis garcia  gerrard  hamann  riise  kewell (nunez 56)  morientes (baros 74).  subs not used: pellegrino  carson.  hyypia  traore  hamann  carragher.  riise 1  nunez 113.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho  terry  gallas (kezman 74)  jarosik (gudjohnsen 45)  lampard  makelele  cole (johnson 81)  drogba  duff.  subs not used: pidgeley  tiago.  lampard  kezman  drogba  duff.  gerrard 79 og  drogba 107  kezman 112.  78 000  s bennett (kent).

sport,chelsea denied by james heroics a brave defensive display  led by keeper david james  helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea.  after a quiet opening  james denied damien duff  jiri jarosik and mateja kezman  while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas  header off the line. robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard s free-kick and superbly tipped the same player s volley wide. city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season. and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea - deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. indeed  it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. shaun wright-phillips - watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball  which was blocked by john terry. but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. first  duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman  who turned the ball wide.  soon afterwards  jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard s corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over. chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman s fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas  header from duff s corner. city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal. wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city s lone man up front  left free by terry s slip  contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. the second half started as quietly as the first  although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen s path. there was a nasty moment for petr cech  looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league  when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper. another quiet spell followed  which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt. lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs. another timely challenge  this time from richard dunne in time added on  prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard s volley round the post.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  bridge  jarosik (tiago 56)  lampard  makelele  duff  gudjohnsen  kezman (cole 63).  subs not used: johnson  smertin  cudicini.  makelele  gudjohnsen.  james  mills  distin  dunne  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  bosvelt  barton  sibierski (mcmanaman 85)  musampa  fowler.  subs not used: macken  weaver  onuoha  jordan.  bosvelt.  42 093  h webb (s yorkshire).
politics,brown names 16 march for budget chancellor gordon brown will deliver his budget to the house of commons on 16 march  the treasury has announced.  the budget  likely to be the last before the general election  will be at 1230 gmt on that wednesday  just after prime minister s question time. the annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government s taxation and broader economic predictions. it is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election  widely expected on 5 may.  next month s budget will be mr brown s eighth since labour came to power in 1997. if a may election is called  there could be as little as 18 days between the budget and the announcement of a date for the election. a shortened finance bill would have to be rushed through parliament with all-party support to allow the government to continue collecting revenue. the full finance bill  with the budget measures in it  would then be returned to the commons after the election  if labour secures another term in office. as mr brown announced the budget date in a short ministerial statement  accountancy firm ernst & young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy.  in the budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections  taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and  in many cases  taxes were increased soon after the election result   said aidan o carroll  e&y s uk head of tax.
politics,blair and brown criticised by mps labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.  a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labour s election hopes. the pm insisted nothing would derail labour s campaign  despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. mr brown will again be in the public eye at the party s new poster launch. in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity  he is due to line up alongside alan milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party s election supremo - and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday. relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour s election campaign  a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both 1997 and 2001.  mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.   the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown s britain  by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown. labour s paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a  scorching  from mps adding:  it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other.   backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not  stop this nonsense  this poisonous briefing . lord campbell-savours  a former mp  challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.   they told us very clearly  it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line   he told bbc radio 4 s today on tuesday. mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.  the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. he had then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him  writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.  of course as a waiter for 10 years i have a professional ability here   he joked. mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let  gossip  distract him from helping a unified election campaign. the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.

politics,concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report.  the government s response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. some are worried it could be scuppered if  as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested  gcses and a-levels stay. sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday.  it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response   said the chairman of the commons education select committee  labour mp barry sheerman.  his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.  we must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system   he wrote in the times educational supplement.  it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.  the qualifications and curriculum authority (qca) has also told the government not to  compromise . the qca said the potential  step-change in participation and attainment  lay in the integrity of the whole diploma.  any partial implementation of the proposals would  in our view  compromise that integrity   said its chairman  sir anthony greener. it is a sign of the qca s concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently. but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills. they may be content if it does not  close too many doors  in writing - whatever spin is put on it.  the chief inspector of schools  david bell  also said recently that gcses and a-levels should go.  one of the reasons why i m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system   he said.  if we don t say this is a sea-change in education  we will miss a great opportunity.  universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals  which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers  organisation  the cbi  which complains of a lack of skills. in an attempt to address this  the tomlinson plan is for tests in  functional  maths and literacy - decidedly not gcses. it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms  concerns on this score. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector  professor chris woodhead  who has said there is no need for such a  massive upheaval . the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a-level grade  no matter how well the others have done.
politics,new drink limit  would cut toll  more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third  a report says.  university college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. the findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government s road safety bill. the bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. the research  carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop  says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk s roads compared with 2003. he estimates that this would save the country £119m a year.  a previous estimate  contained in a 1998 department of transport document  suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. the findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. professor allsop said:  reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver s bac [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit.  only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.   ministers do not support a lower limit  saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. they believe educating drivers is more important. the aa motoring trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers  attitudes to drink-driving. road safety head andrew howard said:  it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.   parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone.  liberal democrat transport spokesman john thurso said drink-driving remained a  major killer   with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. he said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997  which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. the road safety bill  which gets its second reading on tuesday  would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. it also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system  penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. these have been criticised by road safety campaigners  including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody  who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas  leading to more road casualties. in an article for the times newspaper  ms dunwoody  who chairs the transport select committee  says:  slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists.  it is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph  they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. if you are going at 40mph  nine times out of ten they will die.
politics,brown s poll campaign move denied the government has denied reports that gordon brown is preparing to oust alan milburn as labour s election supremo.  work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn  adding they would  work as a team . a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy  while mr milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role.  but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative  putting labour on the back foot  having to respond to conservative policy announcements. these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour. party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centre-stage having seen support rise  in private polling  after his budget last week. but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. mr johnson told bbc news:  gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign.  they were wrong when they said milburn was ousting brown and they re wrong now if they are saying brown is ousting milburn. we work as a team.  mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift. neither downing street nor the labour party would comment directly on the reports.
sport,fa charges liverpool and millwall liverpool and millwall have been charged by the football association over crowd trouble during their carling cup match on 26 october.  millwall  who lost the match 3-0  have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters. during the match at millwall s new den stadium  seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. a disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the hillsborough disaster  where 96 supporters were crushed to death in april 1989. but lions chairman theo paphitis has denied the claims. he has said cctv footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a liverpool fan attacking a millwall fan in the west stand. however  millwall have been charged with two breaches of fa rules. they have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch. liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour. both clubs have until 23 december to respond.
sport,finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals.  after saturday s superb display in the draw in paris  ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday. the versatile finnan  who starred against the french  is confident the group is ireland s for the taking.  there is a chance for us now to go on  win our home games and why not win the group  even though it s a tough one   said the liverpool player. switzerland  ireland  france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris.  in basel we did not play great football  but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game.  in paris  we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances.   looking back  we had an opportunity to get the three points  but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday s game.  on paper  we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves.  automatic qualification is there. it would certainly be good to avoid a play-off  but on the back of a couple of good results i don t see why we can t win the group.  manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on ireland s right flank at the stade de france. finnan s normal position is right-back but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the french.  as i play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back  it was something he (kerr) looked at because france play strongly down the left-hand side.  so i was happy to play and stephen carr and i enjoyed the game  particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks.
politics,campbell returns to election team ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell will return to the fold to strengthen labour s general election campaign  the party has confirmed.  mr campbell has consistently made public his keenness to play a part in the poll  expected in may. both culture secretary tessa jowell and deputy prime minister john prescott have welcomed his return.  he is a strong labour party member   mr prescott told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme.  mr campbell quit number 10 in august 2003 after being tony blair s right-hand man at the 1997 and 2001 elections. labour have refused to discuss his exact new position and have not said how it would affect his downing street replacement david hill.  of course alastair s going to be part of the election campaign and i think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that   ms jowell told sky news.  but she said his return would not put anybody else s  nose out of joint .  this is the daft thing about the way in which politics is written about   ms jowell added.  there s room for everybody. we serve the country better if we make room for all the talent.  a labour source told the sunday times mr campbell would  effectively front  the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title.  labour strategists told the paper he would be  set loose  on conservative leader michael howard in attacking his party s economic record when it was in power.  they used pictures from the 1970s in the 1992 campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent - and now it s our turn   the source told the paper.  making michael howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of 15% even if it was more than a decade ago.  mr campbell was at the centre of the government s row with bbc over andrew gilligan s story about the iraq weapons dossier. the hutton inquiry cleared him of  sexing up  the dossier in the run-up to the iraq war. since leaving downing street  he has toured the country with his one man show  an audience with alastair campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for channel 4.
politics,super union  merger plan touted two of britain s big trade unions could merge to form a  super union  of two million members.  the move by amicus and the transport and general workers union (tgwu) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. amicus has 1.2 million members and the tgwu has 800 000. any merger would have to be approved by the unions  executives and their membership. it is understood meetings will be held on wednesday about the proposal. along with the gmb and unison  the tgwu and amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with labour s leadership over equality at work  holidays and pensions - the warwick agreement. both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours  but one insider pointed out to the bbc news website that  nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda  when the two unions  executives hold their meetings on wednesday. amicus s executive was due to meet in any case although the tgwu is holding specially scheduled talks.
sport,borders 19-20 ulster ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night.  a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish  but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.  the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time  giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders  but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first  mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward. larkin again added the extras. even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break  the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned. the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart  however  when warnock struck a penalty at the other end. and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory.  borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time   said mccall.  in the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.   morton  moffat  macrae  hore  berthinussen  warnock  moore  thomson  ford  douglas  blair  stewart  gray  brown  mcentee.  kay  parr  mcgee  rennick  weston  millar  pattison.  cunningham  maxwell  bell  steinmetz  howe  larkin  campbell  s. best  shields  moore  frost  mccullough  ward  feather  n. best.  brady  mccormick  longwell  browne  doak  s. young  bowe.  phil fear (wru)

sport,man utd through after exeter test manchester united avoided an fa cup upset by edging past exeter city in their third round replay.  cristiano ronaldo scored the opener  slipping the ball between paul jones  legs after just nine minutes. united wasted a host of chances to make it safe as jones made some great saves  but wayne rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. exeter had chances of their own  sean devine twice volleying wide and andrew taylor forcing tim howard to save. united boss sir alex ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to paul scholes and ryan as well as ronaldo and rooney. exeter began brightly with devine and steve flack seeing plenty of the ball  but it did not take united long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. scholes played a lovely pass in to ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of jones to open the scoring.  united sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and ronaldo blazed over before jones saved well from scholes and then rooney. the visitors  pressure by now was incessant and rooney had another shot blocked while ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. just before the break giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage  but the welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. in stoppage time exeter created their best chance as alex jeannin swung in a cross from the left that devine managed to flick goalwards  but the ball flew wide of howard s goal. the grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the united box. rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the st james park mud and jones raced back to gather on the goalline. moments later devine had the chance to make himself a hero  but he could only volley jeannin s brilliant cross wide of howard s goal after being left unmarked six yards out. after rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out taylor showed him how it should be done  his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from howard. the home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for devine s low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. the persistent rooney eventually rounded jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with middlesbrough in the fourth round.  jones  hiley  sawyer  gaia  jeannin  moxey  taylor (martin 89)  ampadu (afful 69)  clay  flack (edwards 74)  devine. subs not used: rice  todd.  ampadu  clay.  howard  phil neville  gary neville  o shea  fortune  giggs (saha 70)  miller (fletcher 66)  scholes  djemba-djemba (silvestre 80)  ronaldo  rooney. subs not used: ricardo  bellion.  ronaldo 9  rooney 87.  9 033.  p dowd (staffordshire).
sport,dominici backs lacklustre france wing christophe dominici says france can claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england.  the champions only just saw off the scots in paris  then needed england to self-destruct in last week s 18-17 win.  the english played better than us but lost  whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam   said dominici.  we know our display was not perfect  but we can still win the grand slam  along with ireland and wales.  france   ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year s rbs six nations  with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.  france take on wales at the stade de france on 26 february and ireland in dublin on 12 march. but although france have yet to click  dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form.  if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on  a solid defence and a team who play for their lives  we can achieve something   dominici added.  i said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches  and that s exactly what is going to happen.  france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting line-up next tuesday for the match against wales.  wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham  which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament. inspirational flanker serge betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury  but number eight imanol harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury. in the backs  centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury  while brive back julien laharrague has received his first call-up as a replacement for pepito elhorga.
politics,final hunts held as ban looms hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal  with more due out later.  thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets  many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday. the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 gmt on friday. the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful.  but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in  with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.  anti-hunt organisations  for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning  say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday  of the league against cruel sports  told bbc news:  we ve long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do.  but if they continue to chase foxes  to chase wild mammals around the countryside  that s against the law and we re confident they ll be brought to justice.  at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire  feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.  she said many people did not share the countryside alliance s optimism that hunting would be able to continue. farmer geoff brooks  a senior member of the quorn hunt  told bbc news people s lives  revolved around hunting . he described the ban as  ridiculous  and  badly thought out  but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.  at the court of appeal on wednesday  the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid. but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.  the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday. the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. a spokesman said:  basically  it s not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields  it will be based on intelligence and information received as well.  the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces  with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. he said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.

politics,ukip candidate suspended eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.
sport,wada will appeal against ruling the world anti-doping agency (wada) will appeal against the acquittal of kostas kenteris and katerina thanou on doping charges  if the iaaf does not.  the pair were cleared of charges relating to missing dope tests by the greek athletics federation last week. wada chairman dick pound said:  i am convinced the iaaf will appeal against the decision  and we will support them.  but if they accept the federation s ruling we will go before the court of arbitration for sport   he added. kenteris s lawyer  gregory ioannidis  reacted angrily to pound s comments.  comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies  create a hostage situation for the iaaf and strengthen our case further   he told bbc sport. kenteris  31  and thanou  30  had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics. they withdrew from the athens games after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august.  but an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in athens.  however  their former coach christos tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal. kenteris and thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking a motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the athens games.
politics,mcconnell in  drunk  remark row scotland s first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk  once in a while .  jack mcconnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk . the first minister s comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness  attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell. margaret davidson  the independent member for the loch ness west  said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.  when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking  began his response with the quip:  i m sure there s no under-age drinking in the highlands.  he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. he said:  i hope i m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people s health and their ability to control what s happening round about them.  mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes  and on the health consequences of binge drinking.  the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that   he said.  far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly.  we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.   he added:  by all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.  snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said:  this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell.  we all know that under-age drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician  particularly the first minister  should encourage young people to get drunk.  the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.  but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults  not youngsters  in mind.  he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s   she said.  it was just a recognition that people will get drunk  but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.
politics,probe launched on ken nazi jibe an investigation by the standards board is under way following allegations that ken livingstone has brought his office into disrepute.  the probe follows the london mayor s comments to a jewish journalist comparing him to a concentration camp guard  after a party about a week ago. the local government watchdog also said the allegation related to a failure to respect others. it has the power to suspend or bar labour s mr livingstone from office. a complaint was made to the body by the board of deputies of british jews and the commission for racial equality.  speaking after the investigation was announced bob neill  leader of the london assembly conservatives  said:  he has behaved in a manner unbecoming of his office and in so doing  has shown extraordinarily poor civic leadership.  his administration is now in crisis.  on sunday  deputy mayor nicky gavron told the bbc s politics show she believed the mayor of london would say sorry on tuesday for offending the wider jewish community. the prime minister tony blair is among those who have called for an apology but so far the mayor has refused.  the mayor accused oliver finegold  of the evening standard newspaper  of  doorstepping  him at a  predominately gay event  held for mp chris smith. ms gavron said she thought mr livingstone s comments were  inappropriate  but she did not believe the mayor was anti-semitic. she said:  i work very closely with ken so i can speak of what he s like in his guarded and unguarded moments and... he is in no way anti-jewish  i wouldn t for a moment work with him if he were.  on the other hand  i think his remarks were inappropriate and i believe it is important  and i believe he will  come to the point where he says   i regret that i have caused offence to the wider jewish community .  i hope he will do it soon and it is mooted that he is going to make some sort of statement on tuesday.
sport,barbarians 19-47 new zealand new zealand proved too strong for an australian-dominated barbarians to round off their unbeaten northern hemisphere tour with an easy win.  rico gear ran in two of the all blacks  seven tries in what was a predominantly second-string line-up. the baa-baas did threaten  scoring tries through albert van den bergh  xavier rush and andrea lo cicero  but never looked like winning. all black aaron mauger was in good form with the boot  adding 10 points. the all blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend s emphatic test victory over france in paris  while the baa-baas had nine wallabies in their starting line-up. and new zealand coach graham henry said:  it was a quality performance against a very experienced side and a number of young guys came through very well.  they learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour.  but the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised. marty holah got the all blacks onslaught under way with his fifth-minute try before rush hit back moments later. but new zealand went ahead once more as gear made use of the space vacated by a temporarily injured chris latham to slide in. ma a nonu then found his way through the barbarians defence to give his side a 19-7 half-time lead. the hosts failed to ignite in the second half and  the moment gear scored his second just after the interval  there was only ever going to be one winner. lo cicero  the sole european for the barbarians  bundled over for a try to briefly curtail the deficit. but the match was blighted by controversy moments later when justin marshall  was felled with a high tackle by jimmy cowan. referee andy turner waved play on and casey laulala coasted in for his side s fifth try. jermoe keino and piri weepu both added tries to the all blacks  tally before the final whistle  while van den bergh gained some consolation for the baa-baas. after the match  barbarians coach bob dwyer warned that south african flanker schalk burger needed a proper off-season break to maintain his standards. burger  21  was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the international rugby board  but has struggled for form in recent weeks.  it s his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season.  i don t think he s played anywhere near that level on tour   he said.
politics,anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament.  tories  lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges  not politicians  should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons  but faces a battle in the house of lords.  the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes  control orders   which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases  and curfews  electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.  the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary  rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice  like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects.  those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march.  the new powers  designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords  concerns  would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.  in a rare move  the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill  saying the house arrest plans are  excessive . it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan  wrongly infringes the right to liberty  by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today:  it gives a minister  for the first time in modern history  the right to detain without trial  without showing the evidence and indeed  in some respects  almost the allegation against the individual concerned.   he questioned why there was  such a rush  to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions  not politicians.  mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be  rash and negligent  to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests  he argued.
sport,disappointed scott in solid start allan scott is confident of winning a medal at next week s european indoor championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.  the 22-year-old scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the jose m cagigal memorial meeting in madrid.  it was definitely a learning curve and i certainly haven t ruled out challenging for a medal next week   said the east kilbride athlete. the race was won by felipe vivancos  who equalled the spanish record.  sweden s robert kronberg was second  with haiti s dudley dorival in third. scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. he won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first iaaf indoor grand prix circuit final.  i should have done better than that   he said.  i felt i could have won it. i got a poor start - but i still felt i should have ran faster.  vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while kronberg and dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.
politics,blair dismisses quit claim report tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election.   you don t do deals over jobs like this   the prime minister told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme. according to a new book  brown s britain  mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004. mr blair said the claims were  reheated from six months ago  and that he was concentrating on running the country. mr blair said:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.  the book  by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper  said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other.  it claims tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party. and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down. according to mr peston the prime minister said:  help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.  but he then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  according to the book.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright  but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  but  in a wide-ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster  the middle east peace process and northern ireland  mr blair said:  when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you.  all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.  he admitted to a  sense of frustration  about the allegations which he said had been made  countless times .  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a  load of nonsense . former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so.  tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of  squabbling like schoolboys . he told sky news  sunday with adam boulton:  this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better.  the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was  getting in the way of good government .  either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election.  during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a  big role  at the general election.
politics,blair to face trust issue head on tony blair says he will be facing the issue of trust and his own integrity head on during the election campaign.  during a question and answer session with first-time voters on five news  mr blair said he had no option but to  confront it  by talking to people. he also dismissed claims government plans to get 50% of young people into university would devalue degrees. he was not  forcing  anyone to go to university  but places should be there for those who wanted them  he said. in answer to a question from 22-year-old liverpool student david dunne about concerns over the prime minister s personal integrity  mr blair said talking was the only answer.  you ve just got to confront it and say to people let s have a discussion on the things that worry you  the things that make you say  i can t trust you  or  i am against you on this.   the  worst thing in politics  was that the electorate only got  little snatches of policy  from things like prime minister s questions and the news headlines. this was why he wanted to  get out of the 30 seconds on the news   he added.  by talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them  even if they did not agree with them  he said. mr blair also faced questions about british policy on iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme. he insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying:  sometimes people say because of what has happened in iraq this is the next place.  instead there was a real chance of a  peaceful resolution  to the problem  he said.

politics,new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra s  lackadaisical  approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.  public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. but mr leigh said the department was  dragging its heels .  that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. he also said defra had been  dreadfully slow  in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.  the outbreak  which began in 2001  led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals  devastated many farms and rural businesses  and is estimated to have cost the uk up to £8bn.  four years after the outbreak  defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors  costs  and £40m of invoices remain unpaid   mr leigh said. mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.  ministers had hoped to get £900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between  two and three times  the commission s assessment of their likely market value. national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. on the issue of the unpaid invoices  sir john said defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001   but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations .  mr leigh said being  better prepared  would also help avoid the need for  mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak . a defra spokesman said:  we welcome the report. it acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak.  however  the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.
politics,mallon wades into ne vote battle middlesbrough mayor ray mallon has been drafted in to boost the yes campaign as the north east assembly referendum enters its final week.  the former police chief  dubbed robocop for his zero tolerance style  clashed on thursday with sunderland no campaigner neil herron. mr mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. but mr herron said north east people did not want or need an assembly.  the pair met on the platform at sunderland station as mr mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. but mr herron - who gained fame as one of sunderland s  metric martyrs  and is running his own no campaign alongside the official north east says no campaign - said he was not convinced by mr mallon s arguments.  the reality is that it is not going to deliver   he said.  labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. if you can t sell a deal in that time  it is a bad deal.  on wednesday  mr mallon provoked fury by branding the official no campaign  two-bit tories  in a confrontation outside its durham headquarters.  the campaign is being run by two-bit conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the north east; they are interested in hitting the labour party over the head   he said. mr mallon is a late recruit to the yes campaign after rejecting overtures from no campaigners including  he claims  tory leader michael howard.  most local observers believe the contest is too close to call  although little recent polling has been carried out. yes campaign chairman john tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. he added:  the government exerts a lot of political power in the north east. the accountability should be in the north east as well.  he also defended the decision to attack the official no campaign s alleged political allegiances.  we felt we had to show what people were behind the no campaign - london tory spin doctors.  graham robb  spokesman for north east says no  said the yes campaign s decision to get personal dragged the campaign  into the gutter  and showed they were  rattled . and he hit back at mr mallon s claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region.  it can push paper around but it can not get people moving   he said. some 487 939 people had returned their ballot papers by wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. the deadline for voting is next thursday  4 november.

politics,guantanamo pair s passport ban the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.  a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain  it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi  the men s solicitor says.  it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january - richard belmar and moazzam begg - have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men s passports. it is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. the letter  from the home office  says:  i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states  the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that  on leaving the united kingdom  you would take part in activities against the united kingdom  or allied targets.   the home office said it could not comment on individual cases.  the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay.  home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added:  the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.  he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament.  amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on  torture evidence  obtained at guantanamo bay.  furthermore  we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay   said director kate allen. the men s solicitor  louise christian  has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy  condemns and prohibits  torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi  23  from croydon  south london  was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in 2001. mr mubanga  29  from north london  was originally detained in zambia.

sport,lennon brands rangers favourites celtic s neil lennon admits rangers could be considered  slight favourites  for the old firm cis cup clash  but insists his side can still win.  lennon concedes rangers are in good form at the moment  but they have failed to beat celtic in their last seven meetings.  rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks   he said.  but it s a game we believe we re capable of winning if we play our best   he told the evening times.  all the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in.  without playing at the top of our game  we have still been winning matches.  at the minute  we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in europe  so i don t think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out.  of course  it is a concern when you are losing goals  because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets  but hopefully we are over that wee run.  considering we lost henrik larsson at the end of last season  we have still been scoring a lot of goals  which is pleasing.
politics,mps issued with blackberry threat mps will be thrown out of the commons if they use blackberries in the chamber speaker michael martin has ruled.  the £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone  pager or to send e-mails. the devices gained new prominence this week after alastair campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a newsnight journalist. mr martin revealed some mps had been using their blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces.  the use of electronic devices in the commons chamber has long been frowned on. the sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the speaker or his deputies. the speaker chairs debates in the commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the house. he or she is always an mp chosen by colleagues who  once nominated  gives up all party political allegiances.
politics,tories attack burglar  u-turns  tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars.  the government has ruled out amending the present law  which allows  reasonable force  in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable  saying:  it is not householders who should be frightened  it s the burglars.  home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.  metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using  grossly disproportionate  force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps:  if we get the right response from those people  we will  of course  support a change in the law.  instead  the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday  mr howard told bbc radio 4 s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change  then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said:  we ve had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns.  it s not surprising gordon brown told him:  there s nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.    mr howard said the  grossly disproportionate  test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were  weighted overwhelmingly  in favour of the householder  said mr clarke. he said:  the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making.  the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue  added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald  says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar  tied him up  beat him and set him alight  he said. tory mp patrick mercer s private member s bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.

politics,uk firms  embracing e-commerce  uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before  e-commerce minister mike o brien says.  a government-commissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ict). the report suggests 69% of uk firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. mr o brien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use  but that there were more challenges ahead. the report  carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe  placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict.  it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use  by using broadband in increased numbers  bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. mr o brien said:  the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring.  it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.  the government would play its part in  cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish   mr o brien said. the  clear message  the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.   however  we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy   he added. the international benchmarking study was based on 8 000 telephone interviews with businesses  of which more than 2 700 were uk businesses. it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the world s most industrialised nations.

politics,galloway plea for hostage release ex-labour mp george galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker margaret hassan  kidnapped in iraq.  mrs hassan  59  who led care international operations in iraq  was abducted in baghdad on 19 october. mr galloway was expelled from the labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on iraq. he denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the al-jazeera arabic television channel.  speaking in london on saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party  the respect coalition  he said:  i have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations.  but this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions.  i am prepared to do anything i can to help save her life.  a spokesman later said mr galloway had friends in common with ms hassan  who he described as a prominent anti-war activist  and that he was  willing to do anything - go to iraq or be an intermediary or anything that s necessary . since her abduction  several videos of mrs hassan have been broadcast by al-jazeera. the latest footage showed mrs hassan asking for british troops to be pulled out of iraq. she also urged care international  the aid agency she works for  to close its office in baghdad  and appealed for iraqi women prisoners to be freed. care has since closed down all its operations in iraq.
sport,chelsea sack mutu chelsea have sacked adrian mutu after he failed a drugs test.  the 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in october. chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for mutu  a £15.8m signing from parma last season  who may face a two-year suspension. a statement from chelsea explaining the decision read: we want to make clear that chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.  mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho. chelsea s statement added:  this applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called  recreational  drugs. they have no place at our club or in sport.  in coming to a decision on this case  chelsea believed the club s social responsibility to its fans  players  employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.  any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules.  the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases.  fifa s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. and the sport s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over mutu s failed drugs test  maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities.  fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it   said a fifa spokesman. chelsea s move won backing from drug-testing expert michelle verroken. verroken  a former director of drug-free sport for uk sport  insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so.  chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate.  it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make.  it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.  it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october 18 and  although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. the football association has yet to act on mutu s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.
politics,iraqis win death test case probe the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the government s refusal to order a full inquiry.  the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousa s death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights. and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out. their families will be appealing against the judgement.  the families  solicitor phil shiner described it as  a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk . father-of-two mr mousa  28  a hotel receptionist  was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september 2003. he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen s lancashire regiment. the iraqi families  lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights.  ministry of defence lawyers argued the uk-controlled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction. but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk-run prison  but did not apply  to the total territory of another state . they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died  his case came within the uk s jurisdiction. the other five iraqis did not die in custody  so their cases had to fail  they said.  and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred  has been timely  open or effective   the judges said. after the ruling carla ferstman  legal director of the human rights organisation redress  said:  it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors.  there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.  other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may 2003. both sides were granted permission to appeal.  prime minister tony blair s official spokesman said:  obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. i would point out  however  that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority.  i can t say anything further for obvious reasons. the mod are considering whether to appeal.  but former british commander colonel bob stewart said :  anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say:  if there s a case to answer  let s have it out. because we don t want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it    he said.  the ministry of defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.
politics,labour mps  fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.  and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party. the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting:  it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt.  it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.  as paul flynn said:  what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times  when we wanted to come together  we wanted to lead on the global issues  to change politics for the next decade  the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party  two people we greatly respect.   stephen pound echoed the message  saying:  we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve  not for the labour party but for this country  is the appearance of division. we remember the 1980s . they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped  the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be  named and shamed . the dressing down appears to have done the trick  with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things. firstly  nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors. even mr prescott admitted that  had he still been a backbencher  he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message.  secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has  to all intents and purposes  kicked off. but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen.  even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that  while mr brown is in africa for a week  the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be  new  labour through and through. similarly  some were pointing out that the chancellor  during the election poster launch  once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. none the less  what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp  effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand. for example  will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter  as may have been the case in the past  what all seem agreed on  however  is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. mind you  we have heard similar pledges before.

politics,child access laws shake-up parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied  lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers  activists had forced the changes  telling the bbc  there is a recognition that something is wrong . between 15 000 and 20 000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year  although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation  saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include:    - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements  based on real-life examples that have worked in the past   - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases   - better access to legal  emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet   - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.     judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a  nuclear option  which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests  a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a  medium range  of penalties  such as fines  community service orders  compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents  lord falconer said:  tagging may be going too far  but let s have a debate about that.  full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published  in the next two weeks   a spokesman said.  the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers  rights groups. john ison  from the controversial group fathers 4 justice  said:  it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.  jim parton  from families need fathers  said the new proposals  lacked compulsion .   we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand  you know what the minimum access is.  otherwise  you see people make agreements which then fall apart.  mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election  which is likely to take place in may.  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may  shadow secretary for the family  told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the government s plans were  inadequate  and were  papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a  radical reform  of the family courts  as well as enforcing a  legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation .  we want to make courts the last resort  rather than the first resort   she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up  like property  when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules  rather than having  rigid targets .
sport,gerrard happy at anfield liverpool captain steven gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at anfield and win trophies with the club.  the 24-year-old england midfielder is determined to see out his contract  despite reported interest from chelsea. he said:  i m signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. there s a lot of speculation but that s not down to me.  as club captain all i want to do is help us get back up the table and into the champions league again.  gerrard looked set to move to chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to stamford bridge has again arisen  with the january transfer window approaching. he raised doubts about his reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. liverpool boss rafael benitez has insisted that gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at anfield. benitez said:  i said to steven that i was sure he wanted to stay here and he said  i do .   i then said to him  look  if you want to win titles  you want medals and you want liverpool to have these things then i am going to need your help .  i really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him.  meanwhile  gerrard has urged the anfield board to sign real madrid striker fernando morientes in the january transfer window. morientes  28  has already expressed a willingness to come to england. gerrard added:  he s a great player. he scores goals in the league  in cup competitions and also in the champions league.  i don t think he d be able to play for us in europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him  we d be getting ourselves a great player.   he d have spanish coaches  a spanish manager and we have got three or four spanish players here now so they ll help him settle in.  rafael benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he s got and if the right players become available at the right price i am sure we will strengthen.  it would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in january to freshen things up.
sport,unclear future for striker baros liverpool forward milan baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss rafa benitez s plans after being dropped for the carling cup final.  baros  who is liverpool s leading scorer this season  denied reports of a row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench. he told czech newspaper daily sport:  i don t know why i didn t play on sunday. i didn t argue with anybody.  i was disappointed but i am not thinking of leaving right now.  the czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to chelsea after extra-time.  baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up. but his admission that he  guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday   will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with benitez. and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are  not in my mind right now   he admitted  everything is possible .
politics,tories plan migrant health checks non-european union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down  while hiv would be dealt with case by case. leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs. labour said many tests were already done. the lib dems warned both parties against  pandering to prejudice .  the proposals  which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election  would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. mr howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in canada  new zealand and australia.  it s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that britain enjoys   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme. government figures suggest tb in england has increased by 25% over the past 10 years.  nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad   said mr howard.   i don t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.  but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants  claims. the proposals include:  - people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and 12 months from a  high incidence tb country  will have to undergo a chest x-ray.   - people coming to settle in the uk permanently from outside the eu will have to  demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health .   - they will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to  impose significant costs or demands  on the nhs.   - the tests will include a health check  chest x-rays for tb (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16-year-olds. only the discovery of tb will mean people will be automatically denied a visa  other conditions will be dealt with on a  case by case basis .  there is already some screening in place. last year 185 000 people were tested for tb at heathrow and gatwick airports  only about 200 were found to be infected. and dr john moore-gillon  of the british lung foundation  said:  tb is not simply imported  we are seeing a rise in many sections of the uk-born population as well.  the government says the tories are  a bit late  to the issue. immigration minister des browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum  as saying:  we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage.  those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk.  meanwhile mark oaten  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman  said:  this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives.  michael howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing  and history proves it is a very dangerous one.  lisa power  head of policy at aids charity the terrence higgins trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based.  in fact  it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status   she said.
sport,keegan hails comeback king fowler manchester city boss kevin keegan has praised striker robbie fowler for his landmark return to form.  the 29-year-old  out of favour at city earlier this season  took his premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in monday s 3-2 win at norwich.  he is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and  in the end  we did   keegan said.  he has worked hard to get back to where he is now.  the former liverpool striker  who moved to city in 2003 after a poor stint at leeds  has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.  fowler overtook les ferdinand on tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the premiership  with 151 goals  and he only trails alan shearer (250) and andy cole (173). and keegan believes there is still more to come from the former england forward.  he can get better if we can supply him better   added keegan.  people want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.  fowler s double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards.  i feel a bit for nigel worthington   he said.  his team have got great character  they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm.  i know it is a killer blow for norwich but i really think they have brought something to the premiership.  the stadium and the atmosphere is great  it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.
politics,opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed  serious misgivings  about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.  michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for  control orders  which include home detention.  i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician   he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals  but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.  the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders  saying:  i m sorry. it is a dilemma  but there is only one choice.  but mr howard said:  we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life.   he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared  internment without trial creates martyrs  and could be  a very effective recruiting sergeant  for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to  enter into constructive discussions  with his party to find a  better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail.  home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man  known only as c  certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday  the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals.   the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions.  we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging  surveillance  limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process  a judge involved in making those decisions   said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.

politics,kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a  fundamental lack of trust  of tony blair as prime minister.  he said backing his party was not a wasted vote  adding that with the lib dems  what you see is what you get . he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme. questions from callers  a studio audience and the show s presenter covered lib dem tax plans  anti-terror laws and immigration.  mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics.  1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair  michael howard and myself were all class of  83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition   he said.  we don t actually hear the argument any longer:  lib dems  good people  reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it s a wasted vote .  you don t hear that because the evidence of people s senses demonstrates that it isn t a wasted vote.  but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people.  there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government   he said.   what we ve got to do as a party - what i ve got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get.  mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party s plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100 000  saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees  introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session.
politics,mayor will not retract nazi jibe london mayor ken livingstone has again refused to retract a nazi insult made to a jewish reporter.  labour s mr livingstone  who says he is  standing by  his remarks  had accused an evening standard journalist of being like a  concentration camp guard . at his weekly press conference on tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. he said to media representatives:  if you think they are racist  i think you are wrong.  the mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs  who arrived in london on tuesday.  i think it is important that the ioc (international olympic committee) members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic  change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget   he said.  on tuesday  the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. two motions were passed by the london assembly  which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor s activities  on monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments. the mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of  examples of intrusion by journalists  into his  and his family s private life.  i don t suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history.  but when reporters say to me i m only doing this because it s my job... that s the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard.   we are responsible for our own choices in this life  i always have been and so have reporters.  an official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the board of deputies of british jews  demanding an investigation by the standards board of england. it has the power to suspended or bar him from office but mr livingstone said:  there must have been 20 instances like this over the last 24 years.   i have never in response to any of that modified a policy i believed to be right or modified a position i believed to be right and i don t intend to now.  because if i do that effectively you hand power over your policies and position to the editors of papers.  on tape mr livingstone  who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper  is heard asking reporter oliver finegold if he is a  german war criminal . mr finegold replies:  no  i m jewish  i wasn t a german war criminal. i m quite offended by that.  the mayor then says:  ah right  well you might be  but actually you are just like a concentration camp guard  you are just doing it because you are paid to  aren t you
politics,blair told to double overseas aid tony blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries  debt and double aid.  some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels  oxfam says in a report  paying the price. the call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the g8 of top industrialised nations.  as rich countries get richer  they re giving less and less. this scandal must stop   oxfam s barbara stocking said.   the world s poorest children are paying for rich countries  policies in aid and debt with their lives.  2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough  but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure   the charity s director added. the report said:  for rich countries  providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice  not an act of charity.  it also points out that in 1970 the g8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. but 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable  the report says.  it argues that the price of not investing in poor countries  sustainable development will be felt across the world. the report said:  global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security.  environmental crises and natural disasters  disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest.  new threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities.  criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.   both the prime minister and chancellor gordon brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. mr blair  who has described africa as a  scar  on the world s conscience  has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. mr brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to britain by the world s poor nations. a spokeswoman for the department for international development said:  the government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013.  if britain s proposal for an international finance facility were adopted  the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier  by 2008-09.  these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on hiv/aids related work over the next three years.

sport,charvis set to lose fitness bid flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales  final two games of the six nations.  charvis has missed all three of wales  victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected.  he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game   said wales physio mark davies. sonny parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury  but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip. centre parker has only a  slim chance  of being involved against the scots on 13 march  so luscombe s return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.  said wales assistant coach scott johnson:  we re positive about hal and hope he ll be raring to go.  he comes back into the mix again  adds to the depth and gives us other options.   replacement hooker robin mcbryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in paris last saturday.  we re getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how robin s looking   added johnson.  we re hopeful but it s too early to say at this stage.  steve jones from the dragons is likely to be drafted in if mcbryde fails to recover.
sport,preview: ireland v england (sun) lansdowne road  dublin  sunday  27 february  1500 gmt  bbc1  radio 4 lw and this website  ireland are going for their first grand slam since 1948 after two opening wins  and england represent their sternest test of the championship so far. england were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against wales and france and another loss would be unthinkable. the pressure is on coach andy robinson and his side have to deliver.  despite england s dramatic dip in form since the world cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - ireland coach eddie o sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors.  had they kicked their points they would have beaten france and that would have created a different landscape for sunday   he said.  this is england we are talking about. they have a depth of talent and a very good record against ireland.  they will target a victory in dublin as the turning point in their six nations.  the differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the dublin encounter.  ireland  despite having gordon d arcy still out injured  have been boosted by the return of star skipper brian o driscoll who missed the scotland game with a hamstring injury.  the knowledge that the england game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation   he said.  the will to play in this game was enormous. it doesn t get much bigger than england at home.  as well as entering the tournament without players like jonny wilkinson  mike tindall and richard hill  england have now lost two tighthead props in julian white and phil vickery while blind-side flanker lewis moody is a major concern. robinson  who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre mathew tait  has kept faith with kicking fly-half charlie hodgson despite his horror show at twickenham. if england slump in dublin  it will be their worst run of results in the championship since 1987.  but robinson was bullish during the week about the game  saying that his side  are going there to get in their faces   and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to england s chances. and despite the recent results  skipper jason robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp.  there is no lack of confidence in the team   said the sale full-back.  we have had a good week s training and we are all looking forward to the challenge.  i still believe in this team. i know if we get our game right we will win the games.   g murphy; g dempsey  b o driscoll  s horgan  d hickie; r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes; m o kelly  p o connell; s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  k maggs.  j robinson (capt); m cueto  j noon  o barkley  j lewsey; c hodgson  h ellis; g rowntree  s thompson  m stevens; d grewcock  b kay; j worsley  l moody  m corry.  a titterrell  d bell  s borthwick  a hazell  m dawson  a goode  o smith.

politics,kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a  zero tolerance  drive  education secretary ruth kelly has suggested.  ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received  spiritual support  from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.  the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one s breakfast with frost:  it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.  we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases  the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.   but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.  i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.  it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school  who sexually abuse pupils or other people  who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei  which means  work of god  in latin  have provoked controversy.  critics say the organisation  which adheres strictly to catholic teachings  is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group  ms kelly said:  i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right.  but those are private spiritual matters and i m sure you ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.  she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas  she argued.  the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review  which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a-levels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins.  ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place   he said.  she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children  teachers and parents.
sport,dallaglio eyeing lions tour place former england captain lawrence dallaglio still harbours hopes of a place on the british and irish lions tour to new zealand.  lions coach sir clive woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the six nations championship. but dallaglio  who called time on england earlier this year  said:  i assure you i wouldn t let anyone down.  i know what it takes and what i have to offer   he told the daily telegraph. dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago.  the 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life. he said:  i ll be in good shape and fresh without another 10 tests on the clock.  from what i witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester  i certainly didn t feel out of place alongside those players  many of whom will be on the trip.   if i m fit and playing well  then i m most certainly available.  if clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop  then fine. if he does  then he won t need to look too far  will he
politics,budget to set scene for election gordon brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of labour s bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth budget at 1230 gmt. he is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability  with low unemployment and interest rates. the chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60 000. but the conservatives and lib dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under labour.  treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway  but mr brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.  - increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60 000   - a freeze on petrol duty   - an extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families   - possible help for pensioners the stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties  general election manifestos. ten years ago  buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty  with close to half a million properties  in england and wales alone  selling for less than £60 000. since then  average uk property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. tax credits as a result  the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government s tax take. the liberal democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150 000 in february.  the tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds  with shadow chancellor oliver letwin branding stamp duty a  classic labour stealth tax . the tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if labour is returned to power. shadow treasury chief secretary george osborne said:  everyone who looks at the british economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances  that there is a black hole   he said.  if labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the budget after the election  of the order of around £10bn.   but mr brown s former advisor ed balls  now a parliamentary hopeful  said an examination of tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. he added:  i don t accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.   for the lib dems david laws said:  the chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing   he said.  but a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.  snp leader alex salmond said his party would introduce a £2 000 grant for first time buyers  reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. plaid cymru s economics spokesman adam price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.
politics,visa row mandarin made sir john the top civil servant at the centre of the david blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the new year honours.  sir john gieve was home office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with mr blunkett quitting. he and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for mr blunkett s ex-lover s nanny came to be fast-tracked. the outgoing head of the troubled child support agency doug smith also earns an honour in the new year s list. mr smith  57  whose retirement was announced by work and pensions secretary alan smith in november  is made a commander of the order of bath.  both men were giving evidence to a commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency  which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments  when the announcement was made. the knighting of sir john  54  will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.  the liberal democrats said it  beggared belief  he and fellow officials could not remember how leoncia casalme s application for indefinite leave to remain went from mr blunkett s office to the head of the immigration and nationality department. meanwhile  the conservatives accused officials of a  collective failure  of memory. but sir alan budd  who led an inquiry into the affair  said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.  downing street defended the decision to honour both men  with a spokesperson saying:  you have to look at their whole career.  sir john was made permanent secretary in april 2001 following a civil service career which dates back to 1974. he has also worked in the treasury and the department of employment. a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said of mr smith s honour:  the award reflects all that he has achieved in a civil service career  principally in the inland revenue  spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the child support agency.   in his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes.  mr smith is set to stay on at the csa until march. less controversial will be the knighthoods for derek wanless and mike tomlinson  who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. former natwest chief executive mr wanless  57  has delivered not one but two major reports on the nhs. ex-chief inspector of schools mr tomlinson  62  has recommended replacing a-levels and gcses with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.
sport,liverpool pledge to keep gerrard liverpool chief executive rick parry insists the club will never sell steven gerrard amid reports chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from anfield.  gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the reds after his superb champions league winner on wednesday. and parry has moved to scotch claims that chelsea could launch a £35m bid.  there is no chance of stevie going in january   said parry.  that just won t happen. our intention is that we will never let him go.  gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give liverpool a 3-1 win over olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages.  of course he is ambitious but so are we   parry added.  we firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a liverpool player.  we have an open and straightforward relationship. we both know where we stand and that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer. if he was not so committed to liverpool he would have gone by now.  gerrard had said before wednesday s game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of europe  with real madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation.   the main point i have made is i want to be in a liverpool side which challenges for the champions league and the title all the time   he said afterwards.  i want to be winning things with liverpool  not somewhere else.  i am a fan as well and i think what i have said the supporters will agree with.  we have to build on wins like that  not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further.  my goal was one of the most important i have ever scored and i hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for a long time.  i know i put a lot of pressure on myself because of what i said  and i felt i needed a big performance  but i am not going to go around telling lies about how i feel.   reds manager rafael benitez believes gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs.  steven can win all he wants with us and we need him. he has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future   said benitez.  but if we want to win more games  important games  we need steven in the team.  we need his strength  the strong mentality he has and his quality. i think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team.
health,"media playback is unsupported on your device media caption dominic raab: ""we're transitioning from level four to level three, so we remain at level four""  the foreign secretary has defended the government easing of lockdown measures in england from monday, despite the country's covid-19 alert system indicating high levels of transmission.  dominic raab said england is ""transitioning"" from level four, when there should be enforced social distancing measures, to level three, when they can start to be relaxed.  he said the approach is ""cautious"".  some scientists advising ministers have voiced concerns about easing the rules.  mr raab told the bbc's andrew marr show the government had ""taken evidence from scientists"" and has met the five tests it said were needed to relax restrictions.  his comments come a day before schools can reopen and up to six people can meet outside in england.  vulnerable people in england and wales who have been asked to stay home since lockdown began will also be able to go outdoors again.  ""because we have made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely, week in, week out, we can very gradually, very carefully, take the steps that we are taking tomorrow,"" mr raab said.  he did not specify when england would move to level three, saying this would be ""decided independently by experts"".  the government would be able to implement ""targeted"" measures in areas that saw an ""uptick"" in cases, he added.  prof peter openshaw, who is part of a body advising the government on respiratory viruses, told the programme that ministers must proceed with ""great, great care"".  asked whether the government is proceeding too quickly, he said there is ""a pretty unanimous message now that we need to take this slowly"".  ""we need to evaluate the effect of each step before we move to the next one,"" he said.  ed davey, acting leader of the liberal democrats, said mr raab had ""failed to provide a convincing explanation as to why lockdown is easing despite the fact that the covid-19 risk is still classified as 'high'"".  in a statement, he called on ministers to ""explain what evidence is guiding their decisions"".  mr raab also said 25,000 tracers are part of england's test and trace system, which aims to enable a move from blanket lockdown restrictions towards the more localised, targeted measures.  however, steve reed mp, shadow communities secretary, said the system is ""in total chaos"" because the government ""got the planning wrong"" and was ""too slow to involve councils"".  ""if they get test and trace wrong, the country risks another catastrophic spike of infection that will lead to a second lockdown,"" he said.  labour has called for councils to be given powers to enforce local lockdowns, a guarantee that no one will have to wait more than 24 hours to receive either a test or test results, and the roll-out of an app to assist with contact tracing.  on saturday, some scientific advisers to the government said the decision to ease lockdown measures is premature, describing it as a ""political decision"" and stressing that the test and trace system should be ""fully working"" first.  estimates by the office for national statistics suggest there are currently 8,000 new cases of coronavirus per day in england alone.  the r value - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, on average - is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 in the uk. if it goes above 1.0 the number of cases will increase exponentially, but if it stays below then the disease will eventually peter out.  culture secretary oliver dowden admitted on saturday the current r value did not leave ""much headroom"".  and school governors are asking ministers to drop plans for all primary pupils in england to return before the summer holidays, saying the ambition piles pressure on schools ""when actually it wouldn't be safe"".  meanwhile, first minister nicola sturgeon has said scotland would stay on a ""slow and steady"" route out of restrictions.  scotland is in its third day of eased restrictions, with up to a maximum of eight people from two separate households able to meet outdoors.  in northern ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors, while in wales, any number of people from two different households will be able to meet each other outside from monday.  a further 85 people have died in english hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus. in wales, another 11 deaths were reported and scotland registered nine. these figures tend to be lower on weekends. the full uk figures will be released later.  in other developments:"
health,"senior conservative mps are urging boris johnson to consider changing the 2m social distancing rule to 1.5m, amid fears for the hospitality sector.  greg clark, chair of the commons science committee, told the daily telegraph it could ""be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs"".  former chancellor lord lamont said measures which could ""compensate"", such as face masks, should be considered.  other countries have different rules.  while some lockdown measures are being eased across the uk, the social distancing rules, which say people from different households should stay 2m (6ft 6ins) apart from each other, still apply.  however, former business secretary mr clark wrote to the prime minister asking for sage (scientific advisory group for emergencies) to review the rule.  even if sage did not recommend reducing the distance, it would be important for it to ""clarify the rationale"" behind 2m and explain ""why the guidance in the uk differs from so many international comparators,"" mr clark said.  france and italy say people should keep 1m (3ft) apart, as does the world health organization. germany recommends a distance of 1.5m (4ft 11ins), while spain, like the uk, has a 2m rule.  the us advises to keep 6ft apart.  on thursday, england's chief medical officer professor chris whitty reiterated that it was ""really important"" that people stayed 2m away from each other.  speaking to bbc radio 4's today programme, lord lamont called on the advice to be re-examined, saying social distancing was causing ""huge problems"" for the hospitality sector.  ""if you want a single measure that could help the hospitality sector, it would be a reduction in the social distancing from 2m to 1m,"" the tory peer said, but insisted he would not want the government to ""ignore"" scientific and medical advice.  his comments come days after kate nicholls, chief executive of uk hospitality, called for the distance to be reduced even further, to 1m (3ft 4ins).  she said: ""if you have 2m social distancing that's the difference between opening at 30% of normal revenues or 60% with 1m social distancing.""  what does the science say about the 2m rule?  a simple guide is that the closer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk.  also the longer a person spends in close proximity with an infected person, the more the chance of catching the virus increases.  sage reported that being exposed for six seconds at 1m is comparable to a one-minute exposure at 2m.  in its latest paper on the issue, from april, it recommends keeping the rule, saying 2m is a ""good measure"" of the distance where the direct person-to-person transmission risk drops significantly.  but it says it should be seen as a ballpark guide to distancing rather than an absolute value.  read more on the science behind the 2m rule here.  former brexit secretary david davis said changes to the government's furlough scheme should be implemented ""in-step"" with a relaxation of the 2m rule.  the government is currently paying 80% of the salaries of 8.4 million uk workers - up to £2,500 a month - but from august, employers will have to start sharing the cost.  however mr davis said some firms would be unfairly disadvantaged if they had to shut because they could not social distance, while being forced to start paying towards staff costs again.  speaking on thursday, mr johnson said: ""i must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay 2m apart from those who you do not live with."""
health,"as the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. while many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying covid-19.  researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.  when people gathered at a church in singapore on 19 january, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. it was a sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in mandarin. among the congregation at the life church and missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from china.  as they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. at that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.  the couple left as soon as the service was over. but shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. the wife started to become ill on january 22, followed by her husband two days later. because they had flown in from wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.  but over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.  mobilising 'disease detectives'  ""we were extremely perplexed,"" says dr vernon lee, head of communicable diseases at singapore's ministry of health. ""people who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. this new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about covid-19 back then.  so dr lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. this involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the uk. it's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.     early in the pandemic, singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus  amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that sunday. they quickly established that two of the singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the chinese couple.  ""they could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says dr lee.  that was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. it did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.  and on top of that was an even greater puzzle. it was confirmed that the third singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?  evidence no-one expected  investigators resorted to going through the cctv recordings made at the church that sunday to search for clues. and they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.  somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.  for dr lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. this was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.  but if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? he remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""  spread before symptoms show  what was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin.     singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control  along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.  being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.  that would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. but exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.  one option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. if the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.  and another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.  some people never show symptoms  this is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. it's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.  this is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. the most famous case is that of an irish woman who was working as a cook in new york at the beginning of the last century.     wherever mary mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.  reporters dubbed her ""typhoid mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.  assumptions undermined  staff nurse amelia powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. she was at work on her hospital ward at addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge in april when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.  she had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with covid-19. but suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive.  ""it was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. ""i thought, 'this can't be right, not me, i'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old amelia.  she had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.  ""i was worried because i've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so i did wonder if this would happen to me."" but, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""i had nothing, literally - i was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally.""  at the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.  the discovery that amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. it produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.  an even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the diamond princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of japan earlier this year. later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases.  researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms.  and at a care home in washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.  'no single reliable study'  different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. that was the conclusion of an analysis by prof carl heneghan of the university of oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.  the upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". and they said that if the screening for covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of uk testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".  the risk of 'silent spreaders'  the biggest concern of amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help.  ""i don't think i passed it on because all the colleagues i work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long i'd been positive for,"" she says. ""but we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""  one study in china which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""as 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""     the team that studied that diamond princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases.  the 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infection  to try to get an answer, scientists in norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.  ""asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to prof neil hall, head of the earlham institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.  prof hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""if you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.  ""any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem.""  a team of scientists in california believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""achilles heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.     china launched a mass testing programme in wuhan  in their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. that was also the recommendation of mps on the commons science and technology committee in a letter to the prime minister boris johnson.  they wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". and they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.  a similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the chinese city of wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.  as many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.  easing of lockdown  as lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. at the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.  that's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. they also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. but where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.     more and more governments are advising wearing face masks  when the us government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in singapore back in january. the logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.  many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. but more and more governments, most recently that of the uk, have become convinced of the benefits.  not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. but because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.  you may also be interested in:  when you talk to intensive care doctors across the uk, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""we've never seen anything like this before.""  they knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in china at the end of last year.  ""it felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the d-day landings,"" says barbara miles, clinical director of intensive care at glasgow royal infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".  read a summary, often in their own words, of what doctors have learnt about how covid-19 attacks the human body."
health,"science photo library  cancer patients need to take extra care  around 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home.  this ""shielding"" is to protect lives.  why do it?  while everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves.  the guidance on shielding is being kept under review as the uk moves out of lockdown.  people in england and wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from monday 1 june, while continuing to follow social distancing rules.  it means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. people living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart.  other parts of the uk have not yet recommended the same.  who should shield?  those most at risk, who include:  solid organ transplant recipients  some people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy  people on immunosuppression drugs  women who are pregnant and have heart disease  people with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and copd  some people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency  while it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, over half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. over 90,000 are children.  anyone in this highest risk category who has not yet received a letter from the nhs or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their gp or hospital doctor by phone or online.  this does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing.  is it compulsory?  experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. if this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations.  you could call your doctor to discuss this.  what does it entail?  it means staying at home and following the guidelines. you should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes.  you should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors.  visits from people who provide you essential healthcare and personal support are fine. carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing with soap and water.  what about any people i live with?  they do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you.  they should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing.  they should also keep some physical distance (two metres) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window.  if you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels.   don't share cutlery  if you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first.  use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery, unless it is clean. use a dishwasher if you have one. soap or washing up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too.  keep surfaces that are frequently touched clean - door handles, taps and handrails.  what about my medicine and food?  communities minister robert jenrick said parcels of food, which would be free initially, and medicines would be delivered to those affected via community hubs.  the treasury will cover the cost and in time hope to refine the scheme so it is ""more tailored to individuals' needs"".  how long will shielding last?  in england, people have been asked to shield until the end of june and this date will be reviewed. in wales, it's 15 and in northern ireland and scotland people have been advised to shield for at least 12 weeks from when they were first told to.  the ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. a vaccine could help towards this.  what should i do if i get a cough or fever?  these are symptoms of coronavirus. it does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the nhs 111 online coronavirus service or call nhs 111 or your doctor. do this as soon as you get symptoms. do not visit the gp, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital.  in an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill.  other tips to stay safe and well  good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:  keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible.  look after your mental wellbeing. stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online.  prepare a hospital bag just in case - this should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas.  extra help  you can register for support with food, shopping and deliveries and additional care.  over two million food boxes have been delivered in england since the programme started."
health,"bryony hopkins  for those living with underlying health conditions, the thought of contracting coronavirus can be terrifying. but while the numbers may appear bleak, there are many people considered high risk who are making a full recovery, as i personally discovered.  panic rose in my chest as i failed to catch my breath. all i had done was walk up the stairs. was this covid-19? was it in my home, in my body, in my lungs?  i have crohn's disease, an autoimmune disease which means my digestive system attacks itself. it's classed as a ""serious underlying health condition"" at this time.  one of the main treatments is immunosuppressive therapies, drugs which reduce the strength of the body's immune system making it more susceptible to infections.  when the first coronavirus symptoms arrived - fever, tiredness - i naively thought ""this doesn't feel that bad"".  when you live with a chronic illness, you live with perspective. i have gone through health crises i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy - open abdominal operations, the removal of my large bowel and a few scrapes with death along the way.  so as my temperature spiked, my mind was full of questions and the horror stories i had read about. would i end up in hospital? would i need a ventilator? am i going to die?  there was no opportunity to be tested, but a doctor suggested it was covid-19. i was told to hold tight and go to a&e if my condition worsened.  after eight days, my symptoms eased. my suppressed immune system had done a good job.  i am not alone in my story. there are many people, like me, considered high risk who have made a full recovery.  ""i tried to stay positive even though i was scared""   khadija  khadija, 25 from leeds, has lived with type 1 diabetes since she was a baby. her pancreas no longer produces insulin, so an external pump, attached to her stomach, administers it for her.  ""i was really apprehensive when i heard i was in the high-risk category,"" she says. ""i just thought, 'i could get it and what would happen if i do?' i was frightened.""  khadija lives with her mum, a nurse who comes into contact with covid-19 patients, and four weeks ago she started to experience some of the virus symptoms.  she had ""achy bones"" and was ""really short of breath"" with chest pains and a temperature.  ""i was panicking at first when i got the symptoms. i knew my immune system wasn't up to scratch.  ""all over the news is the death rate, there wasn't anything about people recovering and surviving. the way i saw it was as soon as you go into hospital with it, you're not going to be coming out alive.""  paramedics were sent to her house, but they decided khadija didn't need to go to hospital. they suggested she call 111 to arrange a test, but none were available.  ""i tried to keep a positive outlook even though i was scared,"" she says.  a few weeks on and khadija has made a good recovery.  ""i felt safer inside""   freya  feya, 37, from manchester, lives with several chronic conditions including asthma, for which she takes steroids. steroids are also a form of immunosuppressants and therefore make you vulnerable to the virus.  before the lockdown, feya felt anxious. news of the virus dominated the media and she experienced a panic attack while out shopping.  ""it was the worst i've ever been,"" she says. ""i wasn't bothered about the lockdown because i felt safer inside.""  two weeks later, feya felt unwell with fatigue and unsteady breathing. she visited her gp who told her to self-isolate.  but she rapidly deteriorated - ""i was coughing so much and struggling to breathe"" and her boyfriend had to call for an ambulance.  ""they said if we could make our own way to a&e that's what we should do because they were so busy.""  feya stayed in hospital for five hours but wasn't admitted so wasn't offered a covid-19 test. her symptoms persisted for another two weeks, including a second ambulance call-out, and she felt completely drained of energy for weeks, but slowly she recovered.  ""i went outside for the first time in two months the other day, which was nice!""  ""you can catch this and only have mild symptoms""   joe dunster  joe dunster has nephrotic syndrome, a kidney condition which resulted in a kidney transplant in 2000. he too is on immunosuppressants.  ""when it started to become apparent the transplant community were in the high-risk group, i needed to shield of course, so i got home and locked down,"" he says.  but that didn't stop him developing coronavirus symptoms. he believes he may have contracted it from his wife, a doctor, who also became unwell.  ""we both suffered from tightness of the chest. at first, we wondered if it was anxiety, but into the weekend i didn't feel quite right. i felt quite wheezy and went on to develop a cough.""  joe also developed a temperature and at that point felt all the symptoms pointed towards coronavirus.  ""the next few days i felt so unwell. the cough and the wheeze stuck around for 10 days.  he says there was ""anxiety"" about what it could turn into, ""but i never felt poorly enough to get seriously worried"".  slowly, he and his wife recovered.  ""it's good that people realise that you can catch this and only have mild symptoms and go on to make a good recovery.""  there is still some uncertainty about whether you can catch covid-19 twice.  that's why khadija, feya, joe and i continue to stay inside.  additional reporting by drew miller hyndman.  for more disability news, follow bbc ouch on twitter and facebook, and subscribe to our podcasts."

health,"iproov  facial recognition in the nhs app could be used as the basis for immunity tests  facial recognition has been added as a way of logging in to an nhs app that lets people order prescriptions, book appointments and find healthcare data.  initially, it will allow faster access to the services on the app, which is separate from the contact-tracing one.  but its developers say it could also be used for covid-19 ""immunity passports"".  such passports, where people carry documented proof they have immunity because of a past infection, are already being tested in estonia.  health secretary matt hancock has previously hinted at the possible use of a ""system of certification"" for those with antibodies for coronavirus.  the nhs facial-recognition system, built by iproov and available in england for both android devices and ios, requires users to submit a photo of themselves from an official document such as their passport or driving license.  the system scans a person's face using their phone and, following a short sequence of flashing colours, their identification will be verified and they will have access to all the services on the nhs app.  more than a million people have now registered with nhs login, with a peak of more than 60,000 new ids verified during the first week of april.  founder andrew bud told bbc news: ""nhs digital has built a strong and trusted identity system in nhs login, which, in my opinion, should form the basis of the uk's immunity passport.  ""whether they do so is a decision for them.""  in response, a spokesperson for nhs digital said it ""has not been commissioned to apply this technology to any other purposes beyond providing a secure login capability via mobile devices"".  immunity passports need to link a person's identity to their coronavirus test results, so would require a robust way of allowing people to verify themselves.  those deemed clear of the virus could then prove their status via a code generated by an app.  the idea has proved controversial, not least because there is no hard scientific evidence that having had the coronavirus provides people with long-lasting immunity.  the world health organization has warned countries against implementing such passports, saying: ""there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.""  societal impact     more countries are gearing up to offer mass antibody tests to the public  but mr bud said: ""at-home antibody tests are coming soon and will quickly cause the creation of a whole information system, of which they will be at the heart.  ""that is inevitable and is no longer subject to political choice.  ""there are big questions that this system will pose to society - such as how to discourage people from uploading false immunity results, how to prevent discrimination on the basis of immunity status and how to stop information leaking uncontrollably.""  estonia has begun testing one of the world's first immunity passports, which would allow citizens to show their coronavirus test results to third parties, such as employers or even restaurants.  taavet hinrikus, founder of transferwise, the company is developing the technology for the estonian system, said it would ""diminish fears and stimulate societies all over the globe to move on with their lives amidst the pandemic"".  but dr tom fisher, a senior researcher at privacy international, said the implementation of such measures needed to be ""necessary, proportionate and based on the epidemiological evidence"".  ""for the moment, immunity passports do not meet this test,"" he said.  ""we must be concerned about the broad societal impact of such immunity passports.  ""they are essentially about limiting the rights of those who are not deemed to be immune.  ""this is a route to exclusion and discrimination.  ""similarly, an improperly implemented programme risks perverse effects, like people deliberately seeking to get infected to gain the benefits of a status of being immune.""  robin tombs, the chief executive of digital identity company yoti said it would be ""technically simple"" to extend its work with coronavirus testers at geneme to antibody tests but: ""the science on covid-19 immunity is still too early to issue meaningful immunity passports."""
health,"pa media  ""do everything you can to signal to friends that things are not back to normal""  the uk is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months.  under the new rules:  from monday, people in england can meet in groups of up to six people in outdoor spaces like parks or private gardens - as long as you remain two metres (six feet) apart  can meet in groups of up to six people in outdoor spaces like parks or private gardens - as long as you remain two metres (six feet) apart in scotland , members of two different households - up to eight people - are allowed to meet outdoors if they maintain social distancing  , members of two different households - up to eight people - are allowed to meet outdoors if they maintain social distancing in wales , people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from monday while maintaining social distancing  , people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from monday while maintaining social distancing groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in northern ireland if they stay two metres apart  we asked doctor and tv presenter xand van tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible.  details of the rules vary across the uk, so if you are living outside of england some of the advice below may not apply to you.   dr xand van tulleken: ""we have to have quite a high level of paranoia""  1. who to invite  the first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus.  if you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. if you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk.  if you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, i would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept.  if you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings.  2. how to arrive  if you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant.  if they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. they shouldn't touch anything. you need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible.  3. social distancing  to maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive.  if you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. i don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about.     one creative approach to distancing attempted in a brooklyn park  you need to find some way of measuring. you could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other.  in your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench.  when we talk about gardens, i look at mine and it's a very small space. to have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible.  4. food and cutlery  in terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept.  if you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. but of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill.  if you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, i would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw.  5. washing hands  if you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so i would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby.  if you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption the university of westminster's dr adele mccormick demonstrates how to wash your hands  you could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. if you're hosting, say to everyone ""we're all going to wash our hands once an hour"".  you could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says ""wash your hands"".  6. using the toilet  there needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet.  you should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids.  once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. you need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels.  you also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom.  you want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. all the surfaces need to be wiped down.  even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this.  7. reunions with children  you're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. but in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. for people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact.  i would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. a proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous.  the only safe advice though is not to hug.  8. alcohol and time-limits  you should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. you are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. we still have a high level of transmission in the uk.  alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk.  the other thing is the time limit. if you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in.  anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer.  9. the clean-up  the virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. i would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left.  this virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the uk. we have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."
health,"some children in england will be going back to school from monday 1 june.  following a heated debate, the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom.  how dangerous is coronavirus for children?  children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus.  adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus.  across the uk, 0.01% of deaths were people under 15, 1% were aged 15-44 and about 75% were over 75.  half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in england, wales and northern ireland were 60 as at 15 may, and half were younger, according to a research charity.  but the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40.   in the uk, three children under 15 have died with coronavirus  children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases, according to prof adilia warris, a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the university of exeter.  they often have ""milder disease than adults,"" she says, pointing out that deaths have been rare.  there have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus.  can children pass on coronavirus to others?  this is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads.  it is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is - at any age. to understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population, and work out how they might have caught it.     a university college london review of the evidence, based on studies using contact tracing and population screening, suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus.  the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) said the ""balance of evidence"" suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and, if they do catch it, less likely to pass it on. but the ""evidence remains inconclusive,"" it said.  one study looking at cases in shenzhen in china at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus, raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms. but research carried out since then has been more reassuring.  studies of clusters of infections in family groups across china have concluded - based on contact tracing - that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children.     a study of a cluster of infections in the french alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms.  community studies in iceland, south korea, the netherlands and italy all found evidence children were less likely to have - or have had - the virus than adults. the italian region studied tested 70% of its population.  a review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded: ""the role of children in transmission is unclear, but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection, and lower rates of children bringing infections into households.""  one theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells. but experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this.  what about the risks to staff?  more children in schools means more teachers working, and more parents at the school gates, and it's not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection.  as the sage report says, ""it is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff, parents, and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school.""  the group of scientists modelled nine different ""return to school"" scenarios.  on 16 may, deputy chief medical officer for england dr jenny harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the r number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading - while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school.     it was reported that in 22 european union countries where schools were partially reopened, there hadn't been a significant increase in cases, including among staff. these countries all opened up schools to different extents.  france did report a small uptick in cases after partially re-opening schools.  but world health organization (who) chief scientist dr soumya swaminathan agrees that children are ""less capable"" of spreading the virus, and are at ""very low risk"" of getting ill from the disease.  ""what we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.""  why send primary school children back first?  government guidelines say it wants to start with reception, year 1 and year 6 children in england because:  these year groups have important educational needs  younger children are less likely to become unwell if infected  older children are more likely to have higher numbers of contacts outside school so pose a greater transmission risk  older children are typically better able to learn at home  the government says secondary schools in england will be able to reopen to year 10 and year 12 from monday 15 june.  but only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time  the schools minister nick gibbs told mps there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in england back before the summer break.  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?"
health,"a protester's sign casts doubt on the existence of coronavirus during a demonstration in california in early may  a bbc team tracking coronavirus misinformation has found links to assaults, arsons and deaths. and experts say the potential for indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health information could be much bigger.  ""we thought the government was using it to distract us,"" says brian lee hitchens, ""or it was to do with 5g. so we didn't follow the rules or seek help sooner.""  brian, 46, is talking by phone from his hospital bed in florida. his wife is critically ill - sedated, on a ventilator in an adjacent ward.  ""the battle that they've been having is with her lungs,"" he says, voice wobbling. ""they're inflamed. her body just is not responding.""  after reading online conspiracy theories, they thought the disease was a hoax - or, at the very least, no worse than flu. but then in early may, the couple caught covid-19.  ""and now i realise that coronavirus is definitely not fake,"" he says, running out of breath. ""it's out there and it's spreading.""   brian lee hitchens  brian lee hitchens thought the virus was a hoax - until he and his wife caught it  dangerous misinformation  a bbc team has been tracking the human toll of coronavirus misinformation. we've investigated dozens of cases - some previously unreported - speaking to the people affected and medical authorities in an attempt to verify the stories.  the effects have spread all around the world.  online rumours led to mob attacks in india and mass poisonings in iran. telecommunications engineers have been threatened and attacked and phone masts have been set alight in the uk and other countries - all because of conspiracy theories.  and in arizona, a couple mistakenly thought a bottle of fish tank cleaner contained a preventative medicine.  poisoned by cleaning products  it was late march when wanda and gary lenius started to hear about hydroxychloroquine.  the couple noticed a similar-sounding ingredient on the label of an old bottle that was lying around their house in phoenix.  hydroxychloroquine may have potential to fight the virus - but as research continues, it remains unproven. on monday, the world health organisation halted its use in trials after a recent study suggested it could actually increase the risk of patients dying from covid-19.  speculation about its effectiveness started circulating online in china in late january. media organisations, including chinese state outlets, tweeted out old studies where it was tested as an anti-viral medicine.     president trump says he has been taking hydroxychloroquine  then a french doctor claimed encouraging results. although doubt was later cast on that study, interest in hydroxychloroquine surged. it was mentioned, with various degrees of scepticism, by a variety of media outlets and influential people including tesla chief executive elon musk and brazilian president jair bolsonaro.  it also found its way into white house press briefings - and president trump's twitter feed.  skip twitter post by @realdonaldtrump hydroxychloroquine & azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. the fda has moved mountains - thank you! hopefully they will both (h works better with a, international journal of antimicrobial agents)..... — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 21, 2020 report  ""what do you have to lose?"" he said on 3 april. ""take it."" in mid-may, he went further - saying that he'd been following his own advice. each comment resulted in big spikes in social media chatter about the drug, according to data from online monitoring tool crowdtangle.  overdoses of the drug are rare, but the anxiety produced by the pandemic has driven people to extreme measures.  in nigeria, hospital admissions from hydroxychloroquine poisoning provoked lagos state health officials to warn people against using the drug.  and in early march, a 43-year-old vietnamese man was admitted to a poison control clinic in hanoi after taking a large dose of chloroquine. he was red, trembling and unable to see straight. the clinic's director, dr nguyen trung nguyen, said the man was lucky he received treatment quickly - or else he might have died.  gary lenius was not so fortunate. the cleaner he and wanda gulped down contained a different chemical, and was poisonous.  within minutes, both started feeling dizzy and hot. they vomited and struggled to breathe. gary died, and wanda was hospitalised.  wanda later explained why the couple drank the concoction.  ""trump kept saying it was pretty much a cure,"" she said.     president donald trump speaks at a daily press briefing about the pandemic  alcohol poisoning  in iran, authorities say hundreds have died from alcohol poisoning after viral rumours about its curative effects.  the total was put at 796 by the end of april by kambiz soltaninejad, an official from iran's legal medicine organisation, who said it was the result of ""fake news on social media.""  the truth behind the number is murky in a country where alcohol is banned in iran and bootleg moonshine is routinely contaminated.  however in this case, bbc journalists did see rumours of the supposed ""cure"" spreading on the messaging app telegram before the official announcement.  shayan sardarizadeh of bbc monitoring's disinformation team notes that the announcement was potentially embarrassing to the iranian authorities and, if anything, the number could be an underestimate.  in one case we verified, a 5-year-old boy went blind after his parents plied him with illegal booze in an attempt to fight the disease.  ""we know that bad information can ruin lives,"" says clare milne, deputy editor of uk fact-checking organisation full fact. ""there's such great potential for harm.""     iranian officials, including president hassan rouhani, meet to discuss the coronavirus pandemic  'my friend ate soap'  president trump has speculated on a number of other cures beside hydroxychloroquine. in late april, he opined that ultraviolet rays could neutralise the virus.  ""and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. one minute. and is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?""  trump later said his comments were sarcastic. but some americans didn't see it that way, and poison control hotlines received calls asking about the advice. officials at one in kansas said they heard from someone who said his friend swallowed disinfectant soap after the president's briefing.     dr duncan maru, a doctor at elmhurst hospital in new york, says his colleagues have treated patients who have become acutely ill after ingesting disinfectant.  ""these ingestions also can have long-term consequences, like cancers and gastrointestinal bleeding,"" he says.   dr duncan maru heads for a hospital shift treating coronavirus patients  arsons, assaults and conspiracies  social networks have also been fertile ground for conspiracy theories. one particular coronavirus-related one - there are many circulating online - has resulted in arsons and assaults.  across the uk, more than 70 phone masts have been vandalised because of false rumours that 5g mobile phone technology is somehow to blame for the virus.     a telephone mast was set on fire in huddersfield in april  in april, dylan farrell, an engineer for openreach, was driving his van in thurmaston near leicester. it had been a long day and he was thinking about what he might have for tea as he pulled up to a roundabout. that's when he started to hear shouting.  at first, he thought it was directed at someone else. but when he heard ""5g!"" being screamed through his passenger side window, he realised the shouting was meant for him.  ""you've got no morals!"" a man shouted. ""5g is killing us all!""   dylan farrell  dylan farrell was abused by a man shouting about 5g conspiracy theories  ""i have no doubt he would have tried to get inside and physically attack me had i not locked the doors straight away,"" dylan says. ""it was so frightening.""  he drove away quickly. there have been no arrests in connection with the incident.  ""we've seen a lot of conspiracies which have been online for a long time now about 5g,"" says claire milne of full fact.

""i hope she pulls through,"" says brian lee hitchens, the patient in florida who got sucked in by coronavirus conspiracy theories. ""but if i do lose her, she'll be in a better place.""   brian lee hitchens  brian used to believe conspiracy theories about coronavirus  brian and his wife didn't have one firm belief about the disease - instead they oscillated between thinking that the virus was a hoax, linked to 5g, or a real but mild ailment.  so they carried on as normal despite official warnings. brian went to work as a taxi driver in his hometown of jupiter. he went shopping and picked up his wife's medications. despite his wife's sleep apnoea and asthma, he didn't bother with social distancing or wearing a mask.   facebook  brian and his wife at a party before the pandemic  catching the virus brought brian back to reality. he turned to social media, this time to warn people off of misinformation and conspiracy theories.  experts say posts like brian's may be more useful in combating conspiracies than news articles and fact checks.  ""one of the most effective ways of trying to correct the record,"" says full fact's claire milne, ""is by getting the person who made the original claim to do it themselves.""  'we lose so many lives because of misinformation'  brian's may be an extreme case, but with the sheer amount of information circulating - the who has called it an ""infodemic"" - many other people have been misled by what they read online.  they're not killing themselves by taking fake cures. instead, they're lowering their chances of survival by not thinking coronavirus is real or serious.  on an unusually cold friday in may, two men in their forties arrived at an emergency hospital in the new york borough of queens. they were roommates, working long shifts and sharing a single bed, and both were seriously ill.  within hours, dr rajeev fernando saw one die in front of his eyes. the other was put on a ventilator.   dr rajeev fernando  dr rajeev fernando working at an emergency hospital set up in new york  dr fernando asked the men why they hadn't come to hospital sooner. they explained to him that they read somewhere online that the virus wasn't very serious.  ""they try alternative therapies,"" dr fernando says.

""misinformation is a structural problem,"" he says. ""blaming somebody for ingesting bleach or for staying at home and dying is akin to blaming somebody who is walking down the street and gets hit by a drunk driver.""  in response to the wave of misinformation, social media companies have drawn up new rules. in a statement, facebook said: ""we don't allow harmful misinformation and have removed hundreds of thousands of posts including false cures, claims that coronavirus doesn't exist, that it's caused by 5g or that social distancing is ineffective."" the company also says it has put warning labels on 90 million pieces of content.  youtube says it does not allow content promoting dangerous so-called cures and has a range of policies against covid-19 misinformation, including disputing the existence of the disease or suggesting that it is caused by 5g.  what lies ahead  but as research continues into a coronavirus vaccine, many anti-vaccination and conspiracy-minded groups and accounts have seen their numbers swell. they pose a potential health threat - albeit not an immediate risk.  what some doctors we spoke to fear the most is that the development of a coronavirus vaccine - something that would be a human achievement for the ages - could be completely undermined by misinformation.   protesters promoting conspiracies about vaccines and 5g attend a protest in st james's park, london in may.  the future is scary, medical professionals say, because of what they're seeing right now.

""the overarching aim is that people should stay at home as much as possible. however, exercising outdoors is an important exception to this rule and is encouraged..."" wales' health minister is considering whether people should be able to meet loved ones not in their household outdoors. the next review of the rules is on 28 may.  scotland: the advice is similar to that in wales. first minister nicola sturgeon says her ""route map"" to lifting lockdown will be published on thursday, with restrictions likely to be eased from 28 may.     the ""stay home,"" message still applies  why do they vary?  even within the uk, we should think of ""a lot of different epidemics"" rather than a single pandemic, according to keith neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the university of nottingham.  it is ""quite reasonable"" for northern ireland, which shares a border with the republic of ireland, to be out of step with the rest of the uk.  and studies suggests the reproduction (r) number, a measure of virus transmission, varies by region.   if the r number is above one, the number of cumulative cases takes off - but if it is below one, the outbreak eventually stops  is the advice based on science, policy or both?  the uk government is advised by a panel of scientific experts, including epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, virologists and medical doctors.  but prof james wilsdon, an expert in science policy, at the university of sheffield, says the lines between evidence-based science and politics are becoming ""very blurred"" and this will increase ""as we try and tiptoe our way out of lockdown"".  there are ""very difficult decisions to navigate"" and the ""cracks are starting to show"".  rowland kao, a professor of epidemiology and data science, at the university of edinburgh, says different governments have to consider ""all sorts of balancing acts"", when it comes to using science to inform policy.

""i was seeing other people's pain, and then i just couldn't deal with the emotional pain that was inside me,"" she says.  over five years, the suppressed trauma related to her friends deaths grew - she wasn't sleeping or eating properly.  ""i was doing quite a good job as a nurse, but actually it was all coming on top of me and then i just broke. i think it was nursing triggering that pain.""   hannah macdonald  hannah had been seeing a psychologist. but one session, before a shift, he showed concern.  ""he asked me if i'd ever thought of suicide and i said 'yes', and then he asked me if i'd done anything towards trying to do that and i went silent.""  he took her to the emergency psychiatric service where hannah was seen by a doctor for a mental health assessment. it was decided she needed to be detained under the mental health act.  ""that was just terrifying,"" she says. ""i didn't actually know what was happening to me. because i was a nurse people thought that i might understand, but i had no clue what was going on.""  she was taken to a secure unit at a london hospital. her nurses uniform still in her bag.  ""in that very first moment my whole world just fell apart. i remember just thinking 'that's it, i'm never going to be a nurse again'.""  her comfort, embroidery, was also confiscated - the scissors and needles deemed too dangerous.  hannah was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (bpd), which affects mood and how a person interacts with others. she believes it stemmed from the unresolved grief of her childhood.   hannah macdonald  according to the nhs, symptoms include emotional instability with often negative, suicidal, thoughts, impulsive behaviour such as self-harm and intense but unstable relationships.  ""you lose how you see yourself. you lose your hopes because you think who's going to want to have a relationship with me now? you then have to deal with the stigma, the self-stigma, but also the losses of physically going into hospital.  ""i was meeting people who had been in that system for 20 years and i just thought, 'this is now my life'.""  but there were moments of positivity.  when hannah was ""really unwell"" her friends at the royal school of needlework invited her to work on a ""secret project"".  ""i walked in and there was white lace everywhere. it was the duchess of cambridge's wedding dress. it was a wonderful, wonderful thing to work on.""  she spent eight days on the project which the world marvelled at.     afterwards, the duchess visited the craftspeople involved, but by then hannah had returned to the secure unit.  ""when i said that i'd worked on her dress one of the nurses actually thought i was deluded.  ""that actually was a really beautiful thing for me to work on at that time. it will go with me for the rest of my life.""  after five difficult years, hannah was referred to cassel hospital in west london, a therapeutic community where patients and therapists live alongside each other and contribute to everything - cooking, group therapy, even supporting each other through the night.  although she was sceptical, she found the peer support extraordinarily helpful - ""the patients understand more than the staff do sometimes"" - and credits that with her recovery.  it gave hannah the confidence to return to nursing - a two-year process.  some medics supported her, while others insisted she be assessed by a private psychiatrist. she found it infuriating that some nhs doctors questioned the validity of their own treatment.  ""i became really determined then, to show that people can come through serious mental illness.""  earlier this year, hannah was offered the job at a hospice. the start date was 11 march.  listen to more from hannah on the bbc ouch cabin fever podcast as she talks about her experience of the mental health system and her recovery.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption twelve years after being sectioned, hannah chose a tough time to return  for more disability news, follow bbc ouch on twitter and facebook, and subscribe to the podcast.

""the lady who interviewed me really believed in me. she could see some of the skills that i'd learnt through my own illness could actually be really beneficial to palliative care.""  even though working with people who are close to the end of their life is difficult, hannah thrives in the environment.  ""there's something very beautiful about palliative care nursing - it's about trying to give what you can for families and patients in the last bit of their life. for me, it's realising it's not my pain.""  coronavirus has changed how hospices operate. only one visitor is allowed, celebrations like birthdays are on hold and staff wear ppe.  the past 12 years makes hannah worry what could await the general mental health of the country when this pandemic passes.  ""my mental illness was unresolved grief, where i didn't say goodbye,"" she says at a time when funerals and final moments are being by-passed or minimised due to lockdown restrictions.  ""i find that quite heart-breaking. as the years go on i think that will be some of the pain that is left behind by coronavirus.""  it's these wider concerns which make her want to tell her story.  and although it has been a long process, she achieved her goal, recovered, and returned to nursing."
health,"sweden's prime minister has admitted the country has not done enough to protect the elderly  care home residents account for nearly half of deaths linked to covid-19 in sweden. some healthcare workers believe an institutional reluctance to admit patients to hospital is costing lives.  lili sedghi's father, reza, was not seen by a doctor on the day he died from coronavirus, at his care home in northern stockholm.  a nurse told her he'd had a morphine shot in the hours before he passed away, but he was not given oxygen, nor did staff call an ambulance. ""no-one was there and he died alone,"" says ms sedghi. ""it's so unfair.""  most of the 3,698 people who have died from coronavirus in sweden so far were over 70, despite the fact that the country said shielding risk groups was its top priority.  sweden, with 10m inhabitants, has kept more of society open than is the case in most of europe.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption 'no one was there when my father died'  ""we did not manage to protect the most vulnerable people, the most elderly, despite our best intentions,"" prime minister stefan löfven admitted last week.  the swedish public health agency told the bbc that 48.9% of deaths were care home residents up to and including 14 may.  sweden did ban visits to care homes on 31 march. but as in many european countries, relatives, staff and union officials have shared concerns that protective clothing arrived too late, and that some staff may have gone to work at the start of the crisis despite showing symptoms of covid-19.  now, increasing numbers of workers are also coming forward to criticise regional healthcare authorities for protocols which they say discourage care home workers from sending residents into hospital, and prevent care home and nursing staff from administering oxygen without a doctor's approval, either as part of acute or palliative (end-of-life) services.  'we were told not to send them in'  ""they told us that we shouldn't send anyone to the hospital, even if they may be 65 and have many years to live. we were told not to send them in,"" says latifa löfvenberg, a nurse who worked in several care homes around gävle, north of stockholm, at the beginning of the pandemic.  ""some can have a lot of years left to live with loved ones, but they don't have the chance... because they never make it to the hospital,"" she says. ""they suffocate to death. and it's a lot of panic and it's very hard to just stand by and watch.""   latifa löfvenberg works as a nurse in stockholm  ms löfvenberg is now working on a covid-19 ward in a major hospital in the swedish capital, where she says the demographic of patients she's treating is further evidence that the elderly are being kept away. ""we don't have many older people. it's a lot of younger people born in the 90s, 80s, 70s.""  a paramedic working in stockholm, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the bbc she had not had a single call-out to an elderly care home connected to covid-19, despite putting in overtime during the crisis.  mikael fjällid, a swedish private consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care, says he believes ""a lot of lives"" could have been saved if more patients had been able to access hospital treatment, or if care home workers were given increased responsibilities to administer oxygen themselves, instead of waiting for specialist covid-19 response teams or paramedics.  ""if you need care and you can benefit [from] care, for example, or oxygen for a short time, you should have it. like any other age group in the population,"" says mr fjällid, a right-wing critic of the centre-left led government.  ""if you have more than 20% that survive without nothing, you could assume that also perhaps the same amount or the same proportion would have survived with supplemental oxygen.""  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption swedish state epidemiologist anders tegnell argues sweden’s strategy is largely working  in april 10,458 people died in sweden, making it the country's deadliest month since 1993, when there was an outbreak of seasonal flu, state-funded statistics sweden reports.  national guidelines  decisions about healthcare staffing and resources are taken at a regional level in sweden, although national guidelines suggest that elderly patients, whether in state or privately run care homes, should not automatically be taken to hospital for treatment.  dr thomas linden, chief medical officer at the national board of health and welfare, says workers should ""professionally weigh the potential benefits"" against risk factors such as catching the virus in hospital and the ""costs"" of transporting patients, including the likelihood of disorientation and discomfort.  healthcare workers are asked not to discriminate on age alone, he says, although biological age may be relevant in combination with other factors.  when it comes to providing palliative care, it is not mandatory to give patients oxygen, and dr linden admits ""the opinions on the value of oxygen is divided between specialities and regions"".  gävleborg, the region where latifa löfvenberg worked at the start of the pandemic, says individual patients' needs are always put first and that nurses can call doctors to make assessments about the need for hospital care.  it is against the idea of care-home workers administering oxygen during palliative care, because it requires specialist training.  christoffer bernsköld, a spokesperson for geriatric care for region stockholm, insists there are enough resources to ensure patients in the capital get acute or palliative care, with a focus on ""specialist homecare units"" providing help in the first instance.     most swedish victims of the virus have been over 70 years old  he points to a new, unused, military field hospital in southern stockholm as proof that the elderly are not being held back from treatment because of a lack of beds.  but he says it can be an ""ethical dilemma"" whether to administer oxygen or transfer patients to hospital.  critics like mikael fjällid see that field hospital as a sign that officials in the capital have been cautious about hospitalising the elderly because they fear overstretching resources, which would be needed to cope with a future spike in cases.  how do other countries prioritise patients?  sweden is not alone in asking healthcare workers to consider the fragility of patients when deciding whether or not to send them to hospital.  but representatives of care homes in other parts of europe have told the bbc they do not share swedish critics' concerns about a lack of access to treatment.  in the uk, the national care association says it believes care has been available for covid-19 patients ""no matter how old or sick"" they are.  the association of german aid for the elderly and disabled says every patient with coronavirus symptoms is seen by a doctor and there hasn't been a single patient who has not received the care they needed. in some cases, entire care homes have been moved into hospitals. many homes also keep emergency oxygen on site.  the danish nurses association says that all patients in need of oxygen are currently sent to hospital. this could be reviewed if there is a shortage of ventilators, although age would not affect future guidelines.  more funding and permanent jobs  at a recent news conference, sweden's prime minister stefan löfven told the bbc that regional authorities had been trusted to make sure healthcare provision ""works the best way"" and given extra resources from the state to cover costs connected to covid-19.  last week the government also announced a further 2.2bn kronor (£185m) for additional training within care homes, with a view to creating 10,000 permanent positions for assistant nurses and care workers.  mr löfven said it wasn't currently the right time to reflect on potential failures, but a national commission would look at how things had been handled at a local, regional and national level as soon as the ""acute"" phase of the crisis was over.  that is a bittersweet message for relatives of covid-19 victims like lili sedghi, who buried her father last week.  ""whatever they did didn't work, because... many, many people in his home are dead,"" she says.  additional reporting by sira thierij."
health,"the first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirus have been reported by a company in the us.  moderna said neutralising antibodies were found in the first eight people who took part in their safety trials.  it also said the immune response was similar to that in people infected with the actual virus.  larger trials to see whether the jab protects against infection are expected to start in july.  work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed, with around 80 groups around the world working on them.  moderna was the first to test an experimental vaccine, called mrna-1273, in people.  the vaccine is a small snippet of the coronavirus's genetic code, which is injected into the patient.  it is not capable of causing an infection or the symptoms of covid-19, but is enough to provoke a response from the immune system.  the vaccine trials, run by the us government's national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, showed the vaccine led to the production of antibodies which can neutralise the coronavirus.  however, testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial.  the people on the trial were taking either a low, middle or high dose. the highest dose was linked to most side-effects.  however, moderna said that even people taking the lowest dose had antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from covid-19.  and antibodies ""significantly exceeded"" those in recovered patients for people on the middle dose.  the study is known as a phase 1 trial as it is designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather then whether it is effective.  it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. however, experiments on mice showed the vaccine could prevent the virus replicating in their lungs.  ""these interim phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mrna-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,"" said dr tal zaks, chief medical officer at moderna.  ""these data substantiate our belief that mrna-1273 has the potential to prevent covid-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.""  moderna said it was hoping to start a large-scale trial in july, and that it was already investigating how to manufacture the vaccine at scale.  oxford vaccine  a vaccine pioneered by the university of oxford is also being tested in people, but there are no results from those trials yet.  however, concerns have been raised about the results of experiments in monkeys.  tests showed vaccinated animals had less severe symptoms and did not get pneumonia. however, they were not completely protected from the virus and signs of it were detected at the same level in the monkeys' noses as in unvaccinated animals.  prof eleanor riley, from the university of edinburgh, said: ""if similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the vaccine recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community.""  however, until human trials have been performed it is impossible to know how the vaccine will perform in people.  follow james on twitter"

health,"more than half a million people have accessed online training that aims to prevent suicide in the last three weeks alone, a charity has said.  the zero suicide alliance said 503,000 users completed its online course during lockdown. it aims to help spot the signs that a person may need help.  it comes as health leaders warned front-line workers tackling coronavirus could suffer from mental ill health.  nhs england launched a mental health hotline to support staff last month.  the surge in demand to complete the suicide prevention programme - funded in part by the department of health - means the zero suicide alliance reached a total of one million participants worldwide since its launch in 2017.  the online training takes around 20 minutes and leads users through the skills they might need to help someone who may be considering suicide, tackling stigma and promoting open communication.  a shorter introduction module - requiring five to 10 minutes - is also available.   the online training programme takes around 20 minutes to complete  the alliance's joe rafferty said the true impact of the coronavirus on mental health will not be known until the pandemic ends.  but he said ""the stress and worry of the coronavirus is bound to have impacted people's mental health"".  ""suicide is a serious public health issue and every single death by suicide devastates families, friends and communities,"" he added.  there were 6,507 suicides registered in the uk in 2018, with three-quarters of them among men, according to the office for national statistics.  'damaging toll'  meanwhile, medics are warning the pandemic is likely to lead to long-term mental health conditions that the nhs needs to prepare to address.  the nhs clinical leaders network warned of the possible impact of the pandemic on the mental health of front-line and other workers.  the group wrote in a paper released on monday that past outbreaks show ""we can expect notable increases in mental ill health and related issues for front-line workers as a result of the covid-19 pandemic"".  they added: ""while preventing the spread of covid-19 is still a public health priority, we're saying that this emergency will also leave a mental health legacy in its wake, a legacy that could inflict a damaging toll on nhs and other front-line staff as well as the public at large.""  the group said an ""urgent call to action"" was needed so health leaders do not ""wait until this problem is upon us"".  launching its staff mental health hotline last month, nhs england said more than 1,500 volunteers from charities such as the samaritans will be on hand to support those who call.  the nhs has also partnered with headspace, unmind and big health to offer support via apps free of charge."
health,"many thousands of care home residents have died since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.  after criticism from the labour leader last week, prime minister boris johnson said: ""we brought the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown.""  the wider lockdown was announced on 23 march so when were measures to protect people in care homes introduced?  there are three main routes for the transmission of the virus into care homes - visitors coming to see residents, members of staff and residents being admitted (for instance from hospital).  visiting care homes  most care homes in england are privately run, but are regulated by national bodies and would typically act on advice from central as well as local government.  general guidance produced on 25 february included advice for carers on what to do if they came into contact with someone with covid-19 - but there was nothing advising against visits to care homes.  in one section it said: ""it remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.""  another section said: ""currently there is no evidence of transmission of covid-19 in the united kingdom. there is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present.""  however, the government's own scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) had advised on 10 february that ""it is a realistic probability that there is already sustained transmission in the uk, or that it will become established in the coming weeks.""  on 3 march, the government released its coronavirus action plan - the document did not mention restricting visits to care homes.  at a briefing the same day, the chief medical officer for england prof chris whitty said on care homes: ""one of the things we're keen to avoid is doing things too early, because if you do them early you get no benefit from the epidemic, but what you do get is a social cost.""  by 5 march, england had had 273 cases of people with the virus.  that day prof whitty told a committee of mps that as there were cases that could not be traced back to people who had come from abroad, it was ""highly likely therefore that there is some level of community transmission in this virus in the uk now"".  italy suspended visits to care homes at this point, five weeks after recording its first case. a day later, nursing homes ireland, which represents hundreds of care homes in ireland, banned non-essential visits, just six days after the first confirmed case in the country.  on 10 march, prof martin green, head of care england which represents independent care providers, directed criticism in an independent article at the government for its response.  at this point in england nearly 800 people had caught the virus, but the article noted that the generic guidance published by public health england appeared out of date, as it said there was no evidence of transmission within the uk. prof green said: ""there is no evidence of a plan. i'm not even certain they have these plans and aren't just making them up as they go along.""  nevertheless, some homes were deciding to close their doors to visitors, with care groups barchester and hc-one stopping non-essential visits on 10 march and 12 march.  scottish care - a representative body for social care in scotland - advised care homes to close to visits on 11 march.  on 13 march, the government's guidance from 25 february was updated to say that ""care home providers are advised to review their visiting policy, by asking no-one to visit who has suspected covid-19 or is generally unwell, and by emphasising good hand hygiene for visitors"".  on the same day bupa and four seasons care homes stopped non-essential visits.  it wasn't until 16 march that it was announced that social distancing should be carried out by everyone, in particular those aged over 70 and vulnerable people.  that day, the prime minister was asked about care homes and said: ""we don't want to see people unnecessarily visiting care homes."" by this point there had been 3,200 cases in england (although the figure given by the authorities at that point was less than half of that; positive cases are now dated to the day the sample was given).  in the period between 25 february and 16 march, 14 deaths of care home residents were reported along with 30 outbreaks in england's 15,000 care homes.  on 21 march, guidance was introduced to encourage medically vulnerable people to remain indoors as much as possible until the end of june - a process known as shielding.  on 24 march, when the lockdown began, people were not supposed to leave their homes at all except for ""essential"" reasons, which didn't include visits to care homes.  finally, on 2 april another document from the department of health and social care said that ""family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life"".  speaking on 15 may, health secretary matt hancock said that on the basis of the 13 march guidance ""many of the care home providers, for instance care uk, at that point stopped visitors"".  moving patients from hospitals to care homes  on 19 march, nhs guidance said that ""unless required to be in hospital, patients must not remain in an nhs bed"".  this policy was implemented to free up beds in advance of an expected surge in coronavirus patients.  on 2 april, the rules on discharging to care homes were clarified, saying ""negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home"".  even elderly hospital patients who had tested positive could be admitted to care homes, according to the document, if measures - such as use of personal protective equipment (ppe) and isolation - were used.  from 15 april, the government said that all patients discharged from hospitals would be tested for coronavirus. by this time, more than 5,700 residents in england and wales had died either in their care home or in hospital.  there are no statistics to show how many cases of coronavirus were transmitted from hospitals to care homes.  chris hopson, the head of hospital representative body nhs providers, said it was ""categorically not true"" that hospitals were systematically discharging patients to care homes with coronavirus, saying there had been a 40% drop in the number of discharges compared with january.  he added that because ""sufficient testing"" didn't come in until mid-april: ""it is possible that a very small number of asymptomatic covid-19 patients [people who had coronavirus but weren't showing symptoms], who trusts were unable to test prior to that date, were discharged to social care.""     cabinet office minister michael gove was asked by andrew marr on 17 may about the government's guidance on moving patients from hospitals to care homes. he said: ""the decision about whether a patient is in a hospital or in another setting, a care home or home, is a clinical decision.""  mr gove acknowledged that government advice had altered over time, ""as a result of our scientific knowledge of the virus changing"".  a department of health and social care spokesperson said: ""we have followed a science-led action plan designed at all times to save lives. this week we announced a new £600m infection control fund for care homes... on top of the £3.2 billion we made available in march and april.""  additional reporting by heather sharp.  read more from reality check  send us your questions  follow us on twitter"
health,"""bubbles"" of people we can meet safely may form part of the plans to move the uk out of the coronavirus lockdown.  prime minister boris johnson has set out a road map for how britain could start easing restrictions and this 50-page document includes the possibility of widening our ""social bubbles"".  what are social bubbles?  a bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact.  coronavirus spreads when people mix - be it at work, in shops, pubs and clubs, or on buses and trains.  in lockdown, to try to control the virus, people have been asked actively to avoid anyone who is not in their household and stay at home.  limiting our interactions with others is our best defence against coronavirus.  the virus is transmitted by droplets from infected people when they talk, cough and sneeze. these can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object.  who should be in my bubble?  it depends on your own health risk if you were to catch coronavirus, as well as the health of the people you live with.  people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home and shield.  that means they should not go out, even to shop for food or collect medicines.  the only people in their social bubble will be the people they live with and any carers who need to visit.  if you live with someone who is shielding, but do not need to shield yourself, you can go out to shop and take exercise but should stick to social distancing rules when you are out, which means keeping 2m (6ft) away from other people.  expanding our bubbles  from wednesday, 13 may, people in england are being told they can start to meet one other person from a different household outdoors.  this is outside your bubble - you will still need to follow social distancing guidelines and keep 2m apart when you meet.  the government has asked the independent advisory group sage to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubble to include a few select people - another household, for example.  that could let people who are currently living on their own have some more social contact.  members of a bubble would be able to visit one another in their homes.  but it would still be important to limit the risk of chains of transmission.  if household a merges with household b, household b could not also link up with another group - household c - because this would create a chain that could allow the virus to spread widely.  the bubble concept is already being used in new zealand and is being considered by the scottish government.  england's deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries says allowing different households to meet as bubbles could be beneficial for ""mental health"" but would be ""complicated"" from a public health perspective, in terms of keeping on top of the virus as more people start to mix.  ""for example, if you have families with large numbers already in their families who want to meet up, you end up effectively with quite a large gathering even if it's just two families meeting.  ""i think it's really important that we think through the implications of that, particularly across families in different circumstances.""  how to keep your bubble safe  continue to stay 2m away from anyone outside your bubble.  wash and dry your hands when you return to your bubble and keep up good hygiene and cleaning practices when you're at home.  if anyone in your bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble would need to self-isolate."
health,"vitamin d supplements are recommended by public health officials during the lockdown  staying indoors for much of lockdown means some people have been deprived of vitamin d.  normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. our skin makes it when exposed to the sun.  but what can we do about it, and why do we need vitamin d?  what is the advice?  people in the uk are already advised to consider taking a supplement of 10 micrograms a day during the winter months (from october to march), and all year round if we aren't spending much time outdoors.  public health england recommends vitamin d throughout the year if:  you are not often outdoors  you live in a care home  you usually wear clothes that cover up most of your skin when outside  people with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors.  scottish and welsh governments and northern ireland's public health agency have issued similar advice for the lockdown period.  sara stanner, of the british nutrition foundation, said: ""staying at home is immensely important and, while many of us have limited access to sunlight, this means we need to take a little extra care to keep our vitamin d levels healthy.""  why do we need vitamin d?  vitamin d is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. a lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults.  some studies suggest avoiding deficiency helps our resilience to common colds and flu, but there is no agreement on whether vitamin d might boost the immune system - study evidence is inconsistent.  should i take lots of it?  no. although vitamin d supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run.  if you choose to take vitamin d supplements:  children aged one to 10 should not have more than 50 micrograms a day  infants (under 12 months) should not have more than 25 micrograms a day  adults should not have more than 100 micrograms a day, with the recommended amount 10 micrograms a day     vitamin d has anti-inflammatory effects and capsules are available in supermarkets  higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin d deficiency.  some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin d.  can it stop coronavirus?  no. there is no evidence that it reduces the risk of catching or getting ill with coronavirus.  but experts do think that it may have benefits during the pandemic.  vitamin d supplements will improve the health of people who are deficient.  some researchers have suggested that vitamin d deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes if someone catches coronavirus. but other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making it hard to draw conclusions.  spanish and french researchers are doing clinical trials to see if vitamin d helps coronavirus patients.  prof jon rhodes, emeritus professor of medicine in the uk, says vitamin d has anti-inflammatory effects, and there is some research that suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses. this could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory ""cytokine storm"" in response to the virus, although much more research is needed to explore this, he says.  where can i buy it?  vitamin d supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. they may be just vitamin d or part of a multivitamin tablet.  do not buy more than you need to help keep supplies of supplements available for everyone, say experts.  the ingredient listed on the label of most vitamin d supplements is d3.  vitamin d2 is produced by plants, and vitamin d3 is the one made by your skin.  vitamin drops are available for babies.     some cereals are fortified with vitamin d  what about diet?  although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels.  it's difficult to get enough vitamin d from food alone.  eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even when people aren't facing a pandemic disease outbreak.  it can include vitamin d rich foods such as oily fish and eggs. some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin d.  should i sunbathe?  although you cannot overdose on vitamin d through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin d with being safe in the sun. take care to cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage.  what about children, babies and pregnant women?  the advice is:  breastfed babies from birth to one year of age should be given a daily supplement of 8.5 to 10 micrograms of vitamin d to make sure they get enough  formula-fed babies should not be given a supplement until they are having less than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day because formula contains vitamin d  children aged one to four should be given a daily supplement of 10 micrograms  the dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women."
health,"policymakers say they are following the science on coronavirus. so what does science say about easing lockdown rules?  prime minister boris johnson has set out a provisional plan to start easing restrictions in england using ""baby steps"".  changes will be gradual to avoid the risk of a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the nhs.  and he says the plan is conditional on infection and death rates staying low.  and if there are any signs they are starting to rise, the brakes will go back on.  this is some of the thinking behind this week's main announcements.  why are the youngest children due to return to school first?  one of the key questions arising from the new guidance is why it's being suggested young children should return to school from the beginning of june.  reception, year 1 and year 6 children would be the first to return.  as well as having particular educational needs, it is suggested:  younger children are less likely to become unwell if infected  older children are more likely to have higher numbers of contacts outside school, so pose a greater transmission risk  older children are typically better able to learn at home  young children are considered a high risk group when it comes to flu.  but they appear to be at low risk of becoming very ill with covid-19.  experts do not know, however, to what extent they can carry coronavirus and spread the disease to adults and each other.  and starting the return to school with only some year groups will allow them to assess the impact on infection rates.  younger pupils may find it more difficult to use face coverings, which are not being recommended for children, and follow social-distancing rules, however.  so the focus will be on handwashing and other hygiene measures.  why can i meet one person only?  in theory, meeting two or more people at a time from the same household should result in a roughly similar risk of infection as meeting just one.  but health secretary matt hancock told bbc radio 4's today programme the one-person rule would keep gatherings of people from different households small, making it easier to stick to the overarching principle of staying 2m (more than 6ft) apart.  somewhere between 1-2m is generally accepted around the world as the distance within which there is most risk of inhaling droplets from another person's coughs and sneezes.  the best evidence suggests coronavirus is most commonly spread by these droplets entering through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object.  but there is some evidence the virus can form aerosols, clouds of lighter particles that hang around in the air for longer, particularly in hospitals during procedures such as intubation.  why is it ok to spend more time outdoors?  activities such as golf and tennis will be permitted but only alone or with one other person.  that person can be from another household.  but social-distancing rules will still apply.  and playgrounds and outdoor gyms, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces, will remain shut.  once expelled, droplets fall relatively quickly to the ground.  but indoor environments have more surfaces for them to land on that others could then touch - and less ventilation.  and independent scientific advisers say the risk of infection is significantly lower outside.  why the change on face-covering rules?  as more people go back to work, buses, tubes and trains will become busier.  and the government is now advising people to wear a face covering when they come into contact with others they do not normally meet, in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible - for example, on public transport or in some shops.     the science behind the advice is somewhat patchy and controversial.  but there is some evidence face coverings might help stop people who are contagious but have no symptoms from unknowingly spreading the virus.  why are the nations doing things differently?  one of the five tests the government says must be met before lockdown can be substantially eased is the rate of infection decreases to ""manageable levels"".  the reproduction (r) number - how many people each infected person passes their illness on to - needs to be well below one.  at the moment, the r number across the uk is estimated to be between 0.5 and one.  but it is thought to be higher in scotland, wales and northern ireland.  so there is less room for restrictions to be eased.  even within england there are differences.  for example, the r will be much higher in care homes and hospitals where there are more cases of the disease.  outside of those settings, the spread of coronavirus in the community appears to have been reduced, potentially to below epidemic levels, according to the office for national statistics (ons).  it estimates 0.24% of people in the general community - about 136,000 people - are currently infected with coronavirus, based on testing a representative sample of more than 7,000 people in england between 26 april and 8 may.  content available only in the uk"
health,"the number of people who have died because of covid-19 is nearly twice as high as the figure we hear announced every day.  by 1 may, the number of coronavirus deaths announced by the uk government was just over 28,000.  looking back at death registrations filed then, the figure is higher: just over 36,000 death certificates mentioned covid-19.  the measure preferred by statisticians, counting all deaths above what would be expected, was even higher: more than 50,000.  each measure answers different questions.  why should i not rely on the government's daily figure?  every day the department for health and social care (dhsc) reports on the number of coronavirus deaths that have been reported to it across the uk.  this is the figure read out at the daily press conference, and the figure used on most international comparison sites.  but it only includes deaths of people who test positive for coronavirus.  that is fine for scientists who want to monitor patterns in the growth of the epidemic precisely: the rate of increase and time spent at the peak are useful measures, says prof sylvia richardson, who is president-elect of the royal statistical society and based at the university of cambridge.  but it's a poor measure of the overall death toll because it misses people who never had a test.  when testing was largely limited to hospitals in the uk, those daily figures were missing most deaths in the community.  on top of this, different countries use different definitions.  for example, england excluded deaths outside hospitals from its daily count until a few weeks ago. scotland, wales and northern ireland didn't.  and belgium includes suspected cases of coronavirus in its daily count, which makes their figures look unusually high compared to other countries.  that makes it hard to do precise like-for-like comparisons between countries, and scientists warn against reading too much into small absolute differences in these daily statistics.  when every country counts things differently, statisticians turn to a different measure - with a simpler definition.  looking at all deaths  if you look at all deaths in a country, irrespective of cause, you will capture the deaths missed by lab testing, the misdiagnosed deaths and the deaths caused by the strain the virus puts on our society.  of course, you'll capture the heart attacks and car accidents that might have happened anyway.  but the total number of deaths registered in a week normally follows a predictable pattern.  it has shot up since the end of march, running far higher than the previous weeks or what would be expected at this time of year. that number has fallen in recent weeks but we're still seeing more deaths than would be expected at this time of year.  and it's these extra or ""excess"" deaths, the difference between the number we normally see and what we're seeing at the moment, that statisticians use to capture the true toll of the coronavirus.  what does it tell us?  adding the weekly excess up over the weeks of the epidemic and it comes to just over 50,000 by 1 may, higher than either the number of death registrations that mention covid-19 or the uk government's daily count.  about three-quarters of this excess can be accounted for by deaths that mention covid-19 on the death certificate - that total was just over 36,000.  but there are still nearly 14,000 deaths, itself a significant spike, that could be undiagnosed deaths caused directly by the coronavirus or those caused by it indirectly.  that gives a clearer picture of the total cost of the virus.  it can also be a better measure for comparing countries because it doesn't depend on which deaths get counted.  making comparisons  but it still ""needs to be put into perspective"" says prof richardson.  the uk releases deaths data every week, but that's not the case for all countries.  some publish data daily, some monthly or quarterly, making it difficult to compare from a similar starting point.  the things that make coronavirus dangerous also differ between countries.  you would expect to see more excess deaths in italy, where the average age is 47, than in ireland, where it's 40.  that's all before you get to the actions that governments take to address the virus: how quickly and how hard they lock down or how effectively they test and track and quarantine cases of the virus and how the health system copes.  without that extra qualitative information on how these measures are taken ""you could miss something pretty obvious"" warns prof richardson.  ""you need to understand the social context of the measures and how they have been implemented.""  just calculating who is worst hit doesn't tell you why they're worst hit.  and it only tells you how countries are doing right now.  we won't have a full picture of who has had the worst epidemic until countries have passed through it.  there will still be deaths caused by second peaks or by the damage done by any lockdowns.  the lack of a single number right now that gives the definitive picture of who's been hardest hit or who is coping best doesn't mean we should avoid all comparisons.  but, says prof richardson: ""you need several numbers - and some understanding."""
health,"john wright  within bradford's asian community a few individuals are spreading fake news that non-white patients will be left to die in hospital. dr john wright of bradford royal infirmary hears from an anaesthetist who has been receiving abusive messages as a result.  the isolation of patients in the hospital from the community outside continues to spark small fires of uncertainty and false rumours. this is happening in cities across the country, and bradford is no exception.  sometimes it's claimed that the higher death rate among black, asian and other ethnic minority patients is because they are being killed off by the very hospital staff meant to help them.  for our muslim clinicians, to have their dedication and professionalism questioned as they work long shifts in the covid wards while fasting during the holy month of ramadan must be especially galling.  but one of my colleagues, consultant anaesthetist fozia hayat, has been telling me about a malicious and foolish message she recently received from a local scaremonger.  it came after her husband tried to dispute a story about hospitals leaving people to die that has been circulating for weeks, as i wrote on 18 april. he said it was wrong, and that his wife, fozia, could vouch for this as a result of her work in the infirmary's intensive care unit.  front line diary   tom lawton  prof john wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research, and a veteran of cholera, hiv and ebola epidemics in sub-saharan africa. he is writing this diary for bbc news and recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio.  at this point fozia started getting sent videos, most of which she didn't open. but there was one she did watch, and she posted a brief reply.  ""i essentially replied to say, 'just be careful what you share, and look at both sides of the argument. it's important to ensure that you've got all the information as you might cause harm - you might stop somebody coming into hospital.'""  the abusive messages continued, despite the start of ramadan and one text message was particularly offensive.  ""i've been sent a message saying that nhs workers are working on bonuses, that we're taking money for putting covid on death certificates and we are essentially taking money for life. and i think that's a really cruel thing to say to someone,"" she told me.  the message accused doctors of forcing people to sign do not resuscitate forms. it also suggested that covid-19 didn't actually exist. then it said: ""please stop selling out and being a mushroom and stand up for the truth. you'll be held responsible in the court of allah for the deaths of these people, for negligence in this life, and life is very short.""   john wright  fozia looked up the meaning of ""mushroom"" on the internet and discovered it was someone who was kept in the dark and fed false information.  ""this is the month of ramadan and we fast in our family, we are practising, and it was quite hard to have somebody send me a message to say, 'you're a sell-out, you're corrupt, a mushroom… you've got blood on your hands,'"" she says.  she was also surprised that it was sent by someone who runs a successful business in bradford. not the kind of person you would necessarily expect to fall for fake news.  ""they seem like fairly sensible people, but that makes it even more worrying,"" she says.  ""it's fine to have an opinion. but don't be cruel. and don't accuse people of things. it's ramadan and it's meant to be a time to be kind and generous to each other.""  our concern is that one or two scaremongers are influencing our patients to stay away from hospital when they really need care.  we know from our own data in the hospital that outcomes for our white and south asian patients are equally good, but careless talk will cost lives and change this for the worse.  we also know that overall - looking at national and international data - black and south asian patients are at greater risk of dying from covid-19, so it is imperative that they seek appropriate care without delay.  fozia reported the offensive message to the police. they were sympathetic, but she decided not to take it further.  instead, she is going to talk about it on radio ramadan, at the suggestion of zulfi karim, head of the bradford council of mosques - and she will reassure people that if they are sick they will be looked after in hospital regardless of their creed or colour.  when i put zulfi and fozia in touch, he was disturbed by what she had been through, at a time when she had been working hard to save lives, and said he was determined to tackle false rumours.  ""we can investigate where it's coming from and perhaps speak to some of those involved. so much good work is going on in the community to educate and inform people and it's really sad that this is happening, and it's very worrying,"" he said.  ""i think we need to deal with the urgent issues and we need to react to messages to make sure we keep people coming into the hospital.""  follow @docjohnwright and radio producer @suem1tchell on twitter  you may also be interested in:"

""it's about acknowledging our contribution to britain.""  a memorial statue of seacole was erected in 2016 in her honour in the grounds of london's st thomas' hospital, where the prime minister recently underwent treatment for covid-19. at the time, it was believed to be the first memorial statue of a named black woman in the uk.  as coronavirus took hold in the uk and temporary hospitals were rapidly constructed, patrick launched a petition to have the field hospital at birmingham's nec named after seacole so she could be acknowledged locally and nationally.  his petition received just under 15,000 signatures and was backed by actress baroness benjamin, and nhs diversity lead yvonne coghill.  he calls it ""a good initial start"" but admits he had been hoping for more responses.  last month, nhs england announced that the birmingham field hospital, alongside six others, would be named after florence nightingale.   centre for ageing better  patrick called the failure to recognise seacole 'a glaring injustice'  ""i felt disappointed that she hadn't been acknowledged,"" says patrick.  ""everyone knows florence nightingale, she is a national name. but recently the royal college of nursing have put mary seacole on the same footing because of her nursing contribution.""  ""it was like a kick in the teeth - especially because of the disproportionate number of bame nhs staff and bame people dying.""  a recent study by the office for national statistics revealed that black people in england and wales were nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus.  the ons said the risk to the bame population could be increased by the fact that some ethnic groups may be ""over-represented in public-facing occupations"".  according to government figures, approximately 20% of all nhs workforce are from an ethnic minority background, rising to 44% of medical staff in england and wales. yet bame people make up just 14% of the population.  ""i wasn't criticising florence nightingale's contribution. but having something symbolic such as naming a hospital after mary seacole, would be a clear positive sign of acknowledgement of the bame contribution to the health service.  ""it felt like a glaring injustice.""  a previous petition to have seacole's image on the £50 note received more than 145,000 signatures, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. the note instead features computer pioneer alan turing.   mark lewis  but this time all was not lost.  on 4 may, headley court in surrey - a former rehab centre for injured soldiers - was reopened as the seacole centre.  the nhs seacole centre, the first of its kind in england, will be used as a temporary service for patients recovering from covid-19.  ""recalling the pioneering work of mary seacole rightly pays tribute to our bame nurses and other staff at the forefront of the extraordinary nhs response to this terrible covid-19 pandemic,"" says sir simon stevens, nhs chief executive.  ""it also serves as a timely reminder that it is their contribution over the past seven decades that has been a foundation for the very success and continuation of the nhs itself.""  and patrick isn't stopping there.  ""as long as we have inequalities in society, there will always be a need to campaign for justice and fairness.  ""these types of hospitals are temporary. we don't know how long these hospitals will last for because obviously the key thing is to make sure people recover.  ""the renaming of the hospital is a good start. but why stop there? we should build upon this.  ""we always have to remind people that we are here, that we are contributing, that we exist. we are not going away."""

health,"emma russell  coping with a life-long phobia of germs meant the bbc's peter goffin was ready for the coronavirus pandemic. he knew how to observe hygiene rules, and he had the skills needed to prevent his anxieties growing out of control.  i was sitting on my kitchen floor, using disinfectant to wipe down a bag of cereal, when i had a revelation: i've spent almost 20 years practising for the coronavirus pandemic.  in my early teens, i was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd). for nearly two-thirds of my life, i've agonised over germs, how they can be transferred, and how i can keep them at bay. and that puts me ahead of the curve when it comes to the types of precautions the world is now being told to observe.  avoiding physical contact with people outside my household, washing my hands after touching anything that anyone else has touched, disinfecting groceries when i bring them back from the supermarket - i've done them all, at various points in my life. and i've perfected my technique.  i recognise a lot of my own tendencies in the new global culture of coronavirus. but what i recognise most of all is the constant, unquenchable anxiety that comes from never really being satisfied that you're safe from infection.  thousands, maybe millions of people around the world are now asking themselves:  ""did that person in the shop get too close to me?""  ""did i wash my hands for long enough?""  ""will this soap kill all the germs?""  in the mid-19th century, french doctors writing early studies of ocd called it la folie du doute - the madness of doubt. that's the best description i've ever seen for the way that i've felt in my darkest moments. and many of us seem to be experiencing something like it now, in the face of the pandemic.  we may be pretty sure that if we maintain distance, and wash our hands, and follow the lockdown rules, we can protect ourselves. but there's always that nagging bit of uncertainty and doubt, and the anxiety that comes with it.  these aren't inherently bad feelings. in small doses, they're what keep us vigilant.  the problem is, they can spiral out of control. as i know all too well, the doubt starts as, ""am i clean enough?""  but grows into, ""will i ever be able to have a normal life again?""  and ultimately, ""why even try?""  growing up in canada, i had problems controlling worry and fear from a very young age - maybe five or six. by the time i was 12, those feelings had narrowed, mostly to concerns about cleanliness and contamination, especially with regards to other people's bodily fluids: spit expelled when they speak, germs spread when they don't wash their hands after using the toilet, and all the dangerous bacteria that i imagined were lurking all around me.  eventually my family noticed i was trying to avoid touching things like door knobs and light switches, and scrubbing my hands red-raw.  i was fortunate to have accepting and supportive parents, who always had a sympathetic ear to lend, and who helped me navigate the often confusing and bureaucratic mental healthcare system. i got into therapy and was prescribed anti-depressants, which i take to this day.  these treatments, and the ocd itself, just became parts of what i considered my normal life. but they did disrupt my teens and early 20s in a major way. when i got home from my lessons at high school and university, i was more concerned with washing off the day's germs than with studying. there were times i stayed up all night doing laundry or showering a second or third time because i just couldn't get ""clean enough"". i kept a lot of friends at a distance, partly because i was worried about contamination - but mostly because i was terrified they would discover i was different from them.   emma russell  in the past five years or so, i've got my ocd anxieties mostly under control. i've become more diligent about confronting and fighting my fears. i try hard to differentiate between helpful worries, and worries that are unnecessary or overblown. i've benefited immensely from having a patient and understanding partner, who holds me accountable when i need it most.  anecdotally, many people with pre-existing anxiety or germ issues have said they are experiencing less worry during the pandemic. maybe because other people have adopted their worldview, are taking the same precautions, and are also now learning to manage high stress on a regular basis.  this is true for me, to some extent. but the pandemic has also thrown up - or revived - some unique challenges for me. public health warnings have reinforced the fact that germs are easily transferred from person to person, even as we pass each other in the street. hand-washing guidance has made me wonder how often i've left the sink without truly being clean. and groceries have presented one of the great re-emerging problems of my life.  wasteful though it may be, i've always preferred to buy packaged food instead of loose items that may have been pawed by other people. but beyond that, i'm relatively unconcerned about my food. in the midst of coronavirus, though, i've returned to the extreme caution i used at the peak of my mental health problems about a decade ago.  now, when i bring my groceries home from the shop, i set them all down in a little-used corner of my flat, the same way i might carefully set aside a pair of shoes after stepping on a discarded plaster or a wad of chewing gum. i wash my hands. anything that can be shaken free from its protective packaging, i set aside - confident it's clean enough already. then, methodically, i clean the remaining items with household disinfectant or washing up liquid and water, placing the finished ones down in a new pile. i wash my hands again, and put my purchases in the cupboard or fridge. none of these are new habits, but they're ones i hoped i had buried forever.  and i'm not the only one experiencing new, or more intense, mental health troubles.  around the world, crisis counselling phone lines have reported a drastic increase in calls since the pandemic began. in the us, some professionals have warned the mental health care system does not have the capacity to keep up with growing demand. and that's to say nothing of countries with even less developed systems of care.   emma russell  as the discussion surrounding coronavirus turns more and more to easing the lockdowns, keeping a cool, calm head may be more important and more challenging than ever. no matter how soon the shops and offices and schools start to re-open, the spectre of covid-19, and all the fears and anxieties that go with it, are bound to hang over the world for months to come.  but, as i've learned from years of self-examination and multiple stints of therapy, anxiety can be controlled.  in my experience, it's been incredibly helpful to talk about my feelings calmly and openly with people i trust, whether they're a qualified professional or a loved one.  i've undergone a form of treatment called cognitive behavioural therapy, first in canada as a teenager and again in the uk as an adult. the purpose of this fixed-term counselling is, essentially, to give patients the skills they need to recognise, challenge and replace thoughts or actions that have stretched beyond the logical or helpful, and into the realm of harm or disruption.  it's best to learn cbt with the help of a professional counsellor. but there are elements of the technique that could be tried on your own, and might be helpful to anyone. like making a list of all the things that are worrying you, detailing in each case why you're worried and how it makes you feel. then you can look at the list, and try to come up with fact-based reasons why some of your worries may be unfounded, exaggerated, or solvable.  for people under lockdown, anxiety could be a complex mix of health concerns, lost income or job security, social isolation, and missing out on the more joyful aspects of life. by identifying each of those worries individually, you may decide you can mitigate some of the stress - fighting isolation by scheduling regular video calls with family or friends, for instance. or planning a big summer holiday or party for whenever the world has safely opened back up.  you might find solace in the advice of experts, who have emphasised that the majority of people who contract covid-19 will survive it. you might be relieved by scientific evidence that regular hand soap or washing up liquid is enough to clean your skin, and doing your laundry in the usual way will remove the virus from your clothes.  above all else, you must remember that none of us are experiencing this pandemic alone.  on my worst days, my doubt and anxiety can grind my self-esteem into a fine powder. i see myself as strange and foolish, like i'm the only person on earth feeling the way i do. but, right now, we all feel the strain of coronavirus in one way or another.  we may be self-isolating to get through this crisis. but we're doing it together.   emma russell  more about mental health:  if you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress, these organisations may be able to help."
health,"being obese is known to increase the risk of a number of diseases, including heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.  early research suggests it may also make people more ill with covid-19, but why is this the case?  is there evidence obesity is a risk for the virus?  this question has been the subject of many studies as experts try to work out the answer.  in a study of nearly 17,000 hospital patients with covid-19 in the uk, those who were obese - with a body mass index (bmi) of more than 30 - had a 33% greater risk of dying than those who were not obese.  a separate study of nhs electronic health records found a doubling of the risk of dying from covid-19 among people who were obese. if other health conditions linked to obesity such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes were also taken into account the risk would be even higher, the researchers said.  and a study of critically ill patients in uk intensive care units found that nearly 34.5% were overweight, 31.5% were obese and 7% morbidly obese (a total of 73%), compared to 26% with a healthy bmi.  these figures compare to 64% overweight and obese in the uk population - 35% with a bmi of 25-29 and 29% with a bmi of 30 or higher.  body mass index is calculated as someone's weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared.  given high rates of global obesity, the world obesity federation says a high percentage of people who contract coronavirus ""will also have a bmi over 25"". early studies from the us, italy and china also suggest it is an important risk factor.  ageing, being a man and underlying health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from covid-19.  why is being obese a risk?  the more overweight you are, the more fat you're carrying, the less fit you are and the lower your lung capacity. this means it is a bigger struggle to get oxygen into the blood and around the body. this impacts on the heart and blood flow too.  ""because people are more overweight, they also have a demand for more oxygen. so that means their system is actually undergoing greater pressure,"" says prof naveed sattar, from the university of glasgow.  during an infection like coronavirus, this can be serious.  ""eventually the obese body becomes overwhelmed by the lack of oxygen getting to the major organs,"" says dr dyan sellayah, from the university of reading.  that is one reason why overweight and obese people in intensive care are more likely to need assistance with breathing and support with kidney function.     what role do fat cells play?  scientists have discovered that an enzyme called ace2, present in cells, is the main way for the virus to enter the body.  higher levels of this molecule are thought to be found in adipose tissue, or fatty tissue, which people who are obese have more of - under the skin and around their organs.  that could be one reason they have a higher risk of catching the disease and a higher risk of being ill with it.  is the immune system affected too?  on top of everything else, the ability of the body to fight off the virus - known as the immune response - is not as good in people who are obese.  that's due to inflammation driven by immune cells called macrophages which invade our fat tissue. they interfere with how our cells respond to infection.  according to scientists, this can lead to a 'cytokine storm' - a potentially life-threatening over-reaction of the body's immune system which causes inflammation and serious harm.  a specific type of fat tissue is prone to macrophage invasion. this may explain why people from black, african and ethnic minority backgrounds (bame), who have more of this type of tissue, ""have elevated rates of diabetes, and may be more vulnerable to the virus,"" dr sellayah says.     could there be other hidden problems?  obesity often comes with other health issues, such as a weak heart or lungs, a poorly-functioning kidney or type 2 diabetes.  this may not come to light until the development of a severe infection such as covid-19 and they all put extra stress on the body.  blood clots are also more likely to develop, but it's not clear why.  what about hospital care?  there can be challenges when it comes to managing patients with obesity in intensive care because it is more difficult to intubate them, and to scan them because of weight limits.  heavier patients may also be more tricky to turn, or prone, in order to relieve their breathing.  what can i do to be healthy?  the best way is to eat a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regularly.  fast walking, jogging and cycling are good options, even with social distancing measures in force.  otherwise, try to eat slowly and avoid situations where you could be tempted to overeat."
health,"there is a simple but crucial number at the heart of understanding the threat posed by the coronavirus. it is guiding governments around the world on the actions needed to save lives and to lift lockdown.  it is called the reproduction number, or simply the r value.  what is r?  the reproduction number is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread.  it's the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average  measles has one of the highest numbers in town with a reproduction number of 15 in populations without immunity. it can cause explosive outbreaks.  the new coronavirus, known officially as sars-cov-2, has a reproduction number of about three, but estimates vary.  how is r calculated?  you cannot capture the moment people are infected; instead scientists work backwards.  using data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus - allows you to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.  generally this gives a picture of what the r number was two to three weeks ago. regular testing of households should soon give a more timely estimate.  why is a number above one dangerous?  if the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card.  but if the number is lower, the disease will eventually peter out, as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.   if the r-value is above one then the number of cumulative cases takes off, but if it is below one then eventually the outbreak stops. the further below one, the faster that happens.  governments everywhere want to force the reproduction number down from about three (the r number if we took no action) to below one.  this is the reason you've not seen family, have had to work from home and the children have been off school - stopping people coming into contact with each other to cut the virus's ability to spread.  what is the r number in the uk?  the reproduction number is not fixed. instead, it changes as our behaviour changes, or as immunity develops.  mathematical modellers at imperial college london are attempting to track how the number has changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced.  before any measures came in, the number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.  the r value in the uk has crept up recently and is now thought to be between 0.7 and 1.0.  counter-intuitively, this increase is probably due to the success in slowing the virus in society as a whole. as cases collapse in the community, the r value is largely reflecting what is happening in care homes.  does r vary across the uk?  the r number has come down across every part of the uk since the start of the epidemic.  but multiple research groups, including those at the university of cambridge, show it has come down the most in london. it is proving far more stubborn in the north-east of england.  those figures are more optimistic than other groups' calculations. similar work by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine puts the number for london at 0.6, and the south-west at 0.9.  it also showed the r-values were 0.8 in wales, and 1 in both scotland and northern ireland.  so how does this inform lifting lockdown?  as any country thinks about how to lift lockdown, the aim will be to keep the reproduction number below one.  dr adam kucharski, of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, told the bbc: ""it's a big challenge making sure you're not loosening too much and increasing transmission.""  however it has taken a monumental effort, one that has caused damage to people's lives, to get the number from three to 0.7.  ""it doesn't give you a lot of room to play with [to keep the number below one]"", dr kucharski added.  which measures could be lifted?  unfortunately, there is no confirmation of how much each intervention affects the virus's spread, although there are estimates.  ""opening schools versus workplaces versus other gatherings - understanding how much they increase the reproduction number, is going to be the challenge,"" said dr kucharski.  another issue is that people's behaviour changes over time, so the number can creep up even if lockdown policies remain unchanged.  what is likely to be needed are new ways of controlling the virus, such as more extensive testing and tracing or location-tracking apps.  these can suppress the reproduction number in a more targeted way, allowing some of the other measures to be lifted.  is it the most important number?  the reproduction number is one of the big three.  another is severity - if you have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems, then you can relax a bit. coronavirus, and the disease it causes, covid-19, can be severe and deadly, unfortunately.  the last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. if you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.  what about a vaccine?  having a vaccine is another way to bring down the reproduction number.  a coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.  follow james on twitter"
health,"coronavirus has forced people around the world to change the way they live their lives. in britain we have been spending most of our time at home, attempting to educate our own children and leaving the house only for essential reasons. what has kept us going? here are eight things british people have been doing to cope with life in lockdown.  1. socialising virtually  with almost half of britons (48%) reporting that their wellbeing has been affected by the coronavirus crisis, according to the uk's office for national statistics (ons), large numbers of us have been forced into finding new coping strategies.  probably unsurprisingly, top of the list of things people say are helping them is staying in touch with friends and family.  almost eight in 10 respondents (78%) cite contacting important people in their lives over the phone, social media or video conferencing as a key factor in coping while being at home, according to ons survey data collected at the end of april.  and individuals have also been flocking to a variety of platforms to stay in touch.  britons are spending more time on social media, with almost half (47%) doing so, according to polling from ipsos mori.  and video-conferencing tool zoom and video-chat app houseparty have seen huge rises in take-up.  zoom says its global daily users went from around 10 million in december last year to a massive 300 million in april, while houseparty has revealed that its app has seen 50 million sign-ups.  people have also been using the internet to continue with other social activities, such as taking part in virtual worship services. more than half of respondents (52%) to the ons survey said they had used digital services in this way.  however, with many of us now relying on the internet for work, social life and entertainment, charities have warned that lockdown has left some of the uk's poorest people shut out of such support networks.  according to 2017 figures from ofcom, only 47% of those on low incomes have broadband internet at home.  the addressing poverty with lived experience (aple) collective, a grassroots network of people with experience of living in poverty, has asked the government to introduce free wi-fi for vulnerable low-income groups.  2. watching films and using streaming services  the second most popular way britons have been coping, according to ons data, has been by viewing on screens.  almost six in 10 people (57%) say they are watching films or using streaming services to help ease the impact of the crisis, according to the ons.  separate research by ipsos mori suggests households are watching more tv overall, with an average of five hours more each week being consumed than before lockdown.  the same survey also reveals families are watching more tv together, with shared viewing up by 37% year-on-year since restrictions began.  ""new routines and habits are emerging, with tv bringing households together to seek comfort in shared experiences,"" says ben page, chief executive of ipsos mori.  3. spending more time with the people we live with - and helping neighbours  more than half of britons (54%) say spending more time with the people in their household has helped them cope, according to the ons.  but it is not only the closeness of those we live with that is easing the effects of the lockdown, some people have also found solace in their neighbourhoods.  community spirit has also grown, ons data suggests, with eight in 10 adults (80%) saying they think people are doing more to help others than before the pandemic began.  but while for some, spending more time with family is helping them survive, for others being in a confined space for long periods of time under high levels of stress is compounding existing problems.  a report by mps on the home affairs select committee has revealed a ""surge"" in violence in the weeks after lockdown was introduced, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the national domestic abuse helpline run by refuge up 49% after three weeks.  the nspcc, which has been awarded £1.6m in government funding, has also reported a spike in demand since the crisis began, with its helpline providing almost 3,000 counselling sessions linked to the outbreak of coronavirus between late january and mid-april.  4. exercising outside and in  about half of us (52%) find exercising outside helps us cope under the current conditions, while almost one in three of us (31%) find indoor workouts beneficial, ons survey data suggests.  there are also indications that some people might be exercising more than before, with separate ipsos mori polling finding that a quarter (25%) have upped their activity levels since restrictions were imposed.  the popularity of virtual classes has soared.  body coach joe wicks claimed a guinness world record after one of his online fitness classes was watched by nearly a million people - the most viewers for a workout live-stream on youtube.  such exercise is not only keeping people fit though, experts say, it can help us deal with the crisis itself.  ""exercise has a dramatic anti-depressive effect,"" explains david linden, professor of neuroscience at johns hopkins university. ""it blunts the brain's response to physical and emotional stress.""  5. cooking, gardening and reading  more than four in 10 britons are turning to cooking, gardening or reading (45%, 42%, 44%) - or all three - to help deal with current restrictions, according to the ons.  news that many of us have turned to baking may not come as a surprise, with supermarket shelves stripped of flour since march.  british grocers saw a 92% increase in purchasing of flour in the four weeks to 22 march, according to consumer research company kantar. that's an extra 2.1 million people who bought flour in those four weeks compared with the year before.  there has been a surge in demand for baking ingredients overall, kantar's analysts say, with sales of suet up by 115% and sugar by 46% in the month to 22 april. more than 40% of the consumers polled by the company say they are doing more home-baking now than before lockdown.  but along with baking ingredients, people are also craving instruction. demand for bread recipes rose dramatically on the bbc good food website in april, with all the top-10-viewed videos relating to baking or bread. nine of the highest rising recipes were also bread-related, with traffic to ""easy soda bread"" increasing 2,700% on last year.  ""the motion of stirring, beating and kneading can be meditative and the results are very rewarding, which is why we are seeing a surge in people wanting to learn new baking skills,"" suggests lily barclay, editor of bbcgoodfood.com.  as well as cooking, gardening has also proved popular, with seed companies across the uk reporting huge spikes in sales at the beginning of lockdown, with some halting new orders altogether.  since then, the royal horticultural society (rhs) says it has seen hundreds of thousands more people use its gardening advice pages compared with last year.  over the past few weeks, a third of a million britons searched for tips on how to grow potatoes, tomatoes and strawberries at home, while traffic to compost pages has increased by nearly 500% on the previous year, the rhs says.  6. doing diy and learning something new  with some britons in lockdown now having more time on their hands, almost a third (32%) are using those extra hours to do diy tasks and more than one in 10 (14%) are learning something new, according to the ons.  the internet is awash with guides on upskilling, from home improvements, languages and instruments to dance, crafts and coding.  but other platforms awarding official qualifications have also reported a surge in enrolments, such as those providing ""massive open online courses"", or moocs, such as edx, futurelearn and coursera.  many, including the world economic forum, believe this shift away from the classroom towards educational technology, or ""edtech"", among all ages could well have changed the way we all learn and educate ourselves forever.  7. spending more on food and shopping locally  new lockdown routines mean britons are also changing shopping habits, placing more importance on food and cooking at home.  figures from kantar show shoppers spent £524m more on groceries in the month to 22 april than last year - despite the fact that the number of supermarket visits fell.  the rise is primarily down to changing habits, analysts say, as people adapt to a new way of living, with people eating fewer meals out of the house.  people are also turning to their local shops to buy essentials, with convenience stores seeing an almost 40% increase in sales, kantar says.  however, not everyone is able to afford the food they and their family need.  the trussell trust reported an 81% increase in need for emergency food parcels from food banks during the last two weeks of march compared with the same period in 2019. it was the organisation's busiest period ever.  8. spending more on home comforts - such as potpourri, scented candles and logs for fires  as well as taking solace in food, there also are signs people have been purchasing comfort items - in a bid to create a safe haven within our own four walls, perhaps.  for example, sales of scented candles and potpourri were up 36% in the four weeks to 22 march compared with last year, figures from kantar show.  sales of logs and firelighters were also up by 36%, kantar says, again suggesting creating a snug home environment has become a priority for many.  such changes in behaviour and buying habits may be why, coming to the end of our seventh week living under restrictions, there are signs many of us may not actually want to go back to our old ways at all.  yougov polling suggests fewer than one in 10 people (9%) actually want life to return to ""normal"" after the coronavirus outbreak is over.  design by irene de la torre arenas, gerry fletcher and zoe bartholomew."
health,"as a precaution, pregnant women have been told to be particularly strict about avoiding social contact, so they reduce their risk of catching coronavirus. but what do we know about its impact on pregnancy?  is coronavirus a problem during my pregnancy?  although there is still much that doctors don't know about how pregnancy can be affected by the virus, pregnant women do not appear to become more unwell than other healthy adults who contract it.  ""if there were huge risks, we would have seen them by now,"" says christoph lees, professor of obstetrics at imperial college london.  like the general population, if they are infected, the vast majority of pregnant women will have mild or moderate symptoms and recover. these include cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and loss of sense of smell.  coronavirus can be a problem in pregnancy if women become seriously ill with covid-19 - but that is very rare.  pregnant women with serious heart problems are in a very high-risk group and are recommended to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact. they should contact doctors about their care.  some viruses are worse in pregnant women, but there is no evidence this is the case for this coronavirus.  what did recent uk research find?  early research based on 427 pregnant women admitted to hospitals in the uk with covid-19 found most were more than six months pregnant, stressing the importance of social distancing in the third trimester.  pregnant women from ethnic minority backgrounds, older women and those who were overweight or obese were more likely to need hospital treatment for the lung disease, data from the uk obstetric surveillance system. found.  the majority of the women gave birth safely, although one in 10 required intensive care. fewer than 20 babies were born before 32 weeks.  scientists are studying the experiences of pregnant women through the pan-covid pregnancy and neonatal registry.  women can give their views on being pregnant during the pandemic in a survey by the university of east anglia.  is there a risk of my baby being born prematurely?  some reports are emerging of babies being born early to women who were very ill with the coronavirus - but it's hard to know the reason for delivery.  ""where a reason is given, it may be due to signs of distress in the baby or to allow better treatment for low oxygen levels in the woman,"" says dr ed mullins, from queen charlotte's and chelsea hospital, london.  during pregnancy, a growing baby places some pressure on the lungs, heart and circulation of its mother. being seriously ill with covid-19 could make this situation worse and cause breathing difficulties.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption coronavirus: ""pregnancy during a pandemic is terrifying""  any woman in this position would be watched extremely closely in hospital.  ""acute illnesses which cause fever can be associated with premature labour and birth,"" says prof marian knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the university of oxford.  however, she said most premature births have been because of early caesareans in women with covid-related breathing problems, rather than because of premature labour starting.  there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage if women become infected.     can i pass the virus to my baby during pregnancy?  this is possible. there have been reports of a small number of cases, but the newborns were discharged from hospital and are well.  a study from china found three out of 33 babies born to mothers with covid-19 were infected.  it is difficult to work out if the babies were infected in the uterus, during labour or soon after birth, when a newborn is likely to have had close contact with the mum.  there is no evidence of the virus causing problems with a baby's development, says the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists (rcog).  what should i do if i'm pregnant and think i have the virus?  if you have cold or flu-like symptoms, you should stay at home for seven days.  if you've got any routine appointments in that time, you should let your midwife, antenatal clinic or maternity unit know about your symptoms.  most women will have mild symptoms which should go away in a few days.  but if you start feeling worse, you should contact your gp, the nhs via 111 (or nhs 24 in scotland), your maternity unit or 999 in an emergency.  the rcog has lots more advice on its website for pregnant women and their families.  should i be working if i'm pregnant?  if you are pregnant and can work from home, you should.     if you are more than 28 weeks' pregnant, or have an underlying health condition, this is particularly important, as you should be avoiding unnecessary social contact.  women less than 28 weeks' pregnant can continue to work outside the home provided they take the necessary precautions, and stay 2m (6ft) away from other people.  advice for healthcare workers who are pregnant is to avoid caring for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection."
health,"media playback is unsupported on your device media caption coronavirus in scotland: the frontline in icu  the bbc has been granted exclusive access to university hospital monklands in airdrie, north lanarkshire, including the intensive care unit which has been at the centre of the struggle to save lives in the coronavirus pandemic.  day and night in intensive care the lights blaze, the monitors beep and the machines buzz.  it is bright and it is noisy but for the patients this is the twilight world, a place where the darkness deepens.  no-one wants to be here, far less to return, but nor do they have a choice.   john needed to be readmitted to intensive care  looking gaunt and ashen, john houston is being wheeled back in to the unit he left four days ago.  his kidneys are struggling to cope with covid-19 and he needs filtration treatment.  ""can't breathe,"" he mumbles as a nurse hooks him up to a jumble of clear plastic tubes and red, yellow and green cables.  a few minutes later john manages a few words, telling us how he was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago and had hoped to be back home with his beloved border collie, cody, by now.  the medication john has been given makes him hallucinate, he says, a common experience for patients in intensive care and one he describes as ""a bit scary"".  doctors here at monklands say the ubiquitous public health advice - to stay home, protect the nhs and save lives - has worked but they also warn that the first wave of infection to hit scotland is still washing ashore.  the number of coronavirus patients here has fallen sharply in the past couple of weeks but the average length of a stay in intensive care has risen during the pandemic.  many of those who remain are extremely sick and cases like john's, where patients need to be readmitted to the intensive care unit, are common.  on the day we filmed in monklands - friday 1 may - seven coronavirus patients died, the highest number the hospital had seen in any 24-hour period since the outbreak began.  in intensive care, we met senior nurse abigail mcsherry as she was putting together a pack of memories for the family of one patient who had just died.  among the items were a diary of the patient's time in the unit, a drawing of a tree based on his handprint and a pair of knitted hearts - one to go with the body, the other to be sent out to the man's family.  partners of patients are only allowed in the hospital under very limited circumstances, essentially for births and deaths. even then, to enter a covid ward, visitors have to don the same personal protective equipment (ppe) as staff - gloves, aprons, masks and visors.  ""his wife was here,"" says ms mcsherry of the man who had just died. ""it was very important because they'd spent their whole life together, from primary school right through. so, it was very important that we let her in.""  ""i got his wife to give his wee heart a kiss,"" she adds.  medical staff are used to dealing with death but that doesn't mean they don't feel its sting.   donna marie mcgroarty says the nurses are exhausted  ""the staff have had a difficult day today,"" says senior charge nurse donna marie mcgroarty.  ""we had a death this morning and then another death there, and that gentleman in particular has got no family,"" she says. ""so that's hard for them.""  as a gesture of compassion for a deceased patient who has no-one to mourn for them, she says, staff stand in respectful silence while the body is taken from the ward. ""that's just something that helps the staff get through this,"" she tells us.  ""we are exhausted,"" adds ms mcgroarty, ""we've been at this from maybe the second week, the third week of january.""  the coronavirus known as sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes, covid-19, came early to monklands because the hospital houses one of scotland's four regional infectious diseases units, with some of the first suspected cases in the country arriving in special ambulance transfers in early february, according to dr nick kennedy, a consultant in the unit.  the hospital's first positive case was confirmed early the following month.  ""it's a strange illness, the likes of which we've never seen before,"" he says.  the unusual virus prompted an unprecedented response, a wholesale transformation of this ageing district general hospital with one aim above all - increasing critical care capacity.  in just three weeks in february and march, says chief nurse karen goudie, monklands was fundamentally redesigned and restructured to handle covid-19.  ms goudie points out new walls, new barriers and new rooms as she explains how the entire building was divided into two separate pathways in an attempt to stop the coronavirus spreading - red for covid patients and the staff dealing with them; green for non-covid.  ""monklands is 40 years old,"" says chief of medical services dr rory mackenzie. ""we have advanced plans for a new hospital. the lack of single rooms is a real challenge for us in terms of managing some of these issues. so having a new hospital would have made this so much easier to deal with.""   dr sanjiv chohan says the health service has changed beyond recognition  instead, dr mackenzie and his team had to be creative. as one of the few areas with a plentiful supply of high-pressure oxygen, the infectious diseases unit was selected to become a high dependency unit (hdu) while the original hdu became an intensive care facility. operating theatres were converted to house intensive care beds.  before the pandemic monklands had the ability to ventilate five patients at any one time. at the peak, a few weeks ago, 15 patients were on ventilators and dr mackenzie says the hospital could now provide 20 ventilated beds if necessary.  for a while the hospital was running three separate intensive care units instead of one. it is now down to two: one red, one green.  ""this is not the health service we had two months ago. this is a different health service,"" says lead intensive care consultant dr sanjiv chohan.  maintaining such a high level of critical care capacity is putting enormous demands on staff and resources.  ""i don't think it's sustainable,"" cautions monklands' head of emergency medicine dr fiona hunter.   dr fiona hunter postponed her wedding to continue the fight against covid-19  these days dr hunter oversees, in effect, two accident and emergency departments - again, one red for covid patients, one green for non-covid - a situation she believes must persist while the virus remains prevalent in the population.  for now that means two senior consultants on site at all times, rather than one. it means double the number of reception staff. it means more expensive equipment and the cancellation of leave.  for dr hunter it even meant postponing her own wedding, which should have taken place on 28 march, when she and her fiance realised the best man would not be able to fly into scotland from france because of the pandemic. it was a difficult decision, she says, but ""the right thing to do"".  ""it allowed me to be freed up to really help with the fight in this department against covid,"" she says.  it's not just the emergency department which is feeling the strain. elsewhere in the hospital, physiotherapists and nurses who usually work in day surgery, operating theatres and the endoscopy unit have been seconded to intensive care.  at the same time the demand for some of those services has risen. many covid-19 patients have intense fatigue and continue to require a great deal of help with rehabilitation, says kirstin cleary, a specialist physiotherapist who has been working in intensive care.  ""even though we're past the peak there's going to be a massive impact on physiotherapy services, social care services and services in the community because these patients are going to need a lot of rehab to help them recover from this,"" she says.  right now the dilemma for monklands is that it simply cannot handle its normal patient traffic while it is configured for a pandemic and yet if there is ""recrudescence"" - another outbreak - intensive care may be overwhelmed again.  ""i think we're over the worst of this current outbreak, and undoubtedly we've seen that in terms of the figures that come through the hospital,"" says dr kennedy in the infectious diseases unit.  ""the trouble is, of course, we don't have an effective treatment. we don't have a vaccine. and so there is every risk that we could have a second wave,"" he adds.  it's not just here. managers across the nhs are now grappling with the challenge of how to maintain critical care at a safe level while also preparing for an expected rise in emergency admissions as the lockdown eases, and the return of patients with other serious illnesses, whose absence during the past couple of months has apparently led to a rise in preventable deaths from heart attacks, strokes and other causes.  ""the overall occupancy of the hospital has been down,"" explains dr mackenzie, and while ""that has made it easier to cope with the covid patients, the main concern we've got is there are patients who need health care [who] haven't been attending the hospital.""   matthew weir says he waited too long to seek treatment for a lung infection  matthew weir from coatbridge is one of them. he is being treated in the infectious diseases unit for a lung infection. it's a fate that matthew, 34, could probably have avoided had he not put off seeking medical help because of his fears about catching the coronavirus.  ""if i'm honest i probably left it a little bit too long, which is why i ended up staying here rather than it just being treated with antibiotics in the first place,"" he says.  dr hunter, in the emergency department, says the pandemic is forcing a rapid reassessment of the balance between providing services in hospital and in the community.  she says the hospital has set up a line for paramedics to seek ""advice and perhaps a bit of back-up"" from consultants on when a patient can safely be cared for in the community, perhaps in a clinic, rather than in hospital.  ""that's something that they didn't have access to before covid but a lesson i would be keen to continue on after covid,"" she says, adding, ""i think it's made a big difference for patient care, by reducing unnecessary admissions to hospital"".  when it comes to cases that do require hospital treatment though, dr hunter is keen to stress that ""we are open for business"".  that's the message in intensive care too where coach driver john johnston is struggling with the effects of covid-19.   john johnston was conscious but on a ventilator so unable to speak  john has underlying kidney issues and has developed a lung infection. he is conscious but on a ventilator which helps him to breathe but leaves him unable to talk.  instead he communicates, with great effort, by writing on a small plastic board.  i ask him if he can sum up his message to the staff here.  ""there are too many words to say to them,"" he manages to write before stopping to wipe away tears.  this pandemic has clearly brought immense and painful challenges for patients and staff alike.  hope, though, springs eternal.   irene norwood was told she should telephone her loved ones because she might not survive  irene norwood, a 51-year-old housewife from cumbernauld, is back in the intensive care unit — but only to say thank you. after a brush with death she is on the mend.  she tells us she only has fragments of memory about her time being treated in here for covid-19.  ""i remember lying in bed at night thinking the machines were talking to each other. i think i must have been hallucinating,"" she says.  irene also recalls a doctor telling her that she was being put on a ventilator and that she should telephone her loved ones because she might not survive.  ""i remember everything was happening really quickly and they said, 'we need to get her to call her family'.  ""i spoke to my husband and my sons. you can only say what's in your heart,"" she recalls. ""if you don't say it you might never have got the chance.""  irene is hoping to leave hospital today and has a simple message for the public.  ""i don't think people understand the severity of this illness and that's what people need to learn. they do not say 'stay at home' for no reason.""  coronavirus: scotland's response is on bbc one scotland at 20:30 on wednesday 6 may and on the iplayer."
health,"are people having fewer heart attacks? and should hospitals protect black, asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers by taking them off the front line? dr john wright of bradford royal infirmary considers these questions in his latest diary.  4 may 2020  one of the intriguing observations during the pandemic has been the marked reduction in patients coming to hospital with acute heart attacks or strokes.  our initial worry was that people were frightened to come in when they needed to - suffering their symptoms at home rather than risking getting infected in hospital. this may still turn out to be the case, but heart attacks and strokes are the sort of episodes in which you would expect patients to seek help. you would expect them to be picked up by health services.  perhaps the slowing down of our frantic lives from our enforced lockdown, and even the cleaner air we are breathing from the reductions in traffic, are helping to keep us in finer fettle? our slow living might be nurturing new healthier habits and lifestyles.  one clue has emerged from people using the fitbit health and fitness tracker in the us.  heart rate is a good indicator for heart health - the lower your resting heart rate the better - and fitbit has found that during lockdown average resting heart rates have fallen.  also, while step counts have also fallen, the number of active minutes has actually gone up - people have swapped desk-based routines for more mobile routines at home.  sleep duration has also increased with people going to bed earlier than normal and sleeping longer. it seems as though the lockdown has had the health-promoting effect of a good holiday.  front line diary   tom lawton  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research, and a veteran of cholera, hiv and ebola epidemics in sub-saharan africa. he is writing this diary for bbc news and recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's the nhs front line  prof alistair hall, a cardiologist and clinical director for yorkshire and humber of the national institute for health research, says he hasn't seen evidence yet of people just staying at home after having heart attacks. on the other hand, he has seen people out exercising in unusually large numbers.  ""i have to drive into the hospital, but as i do i see the roads full of people walking and cycling families. i've never seen anything like it. it looks as if everyone has the time as a family to exercise, and they're taking that opportunity to get out of their homes,"" he says.  he also thinks that people may be more active throughout the day. rather than sitting at a desk for hours and hours they're taking more breaks, walking around, or going up and down stairs, even if they are taking fewer steps overall.  but there's another possible factor at play. he thinks people are remembering to take their medicine.  ""cholesterol is the single biggest preventable cause of heart attacks and strokes in the world,"" he says. ""and i think there's evidence suggests that during this time people are being much much better at taking medications that otherwise they might be forgetting or missing.""  and that extra bit of sleep? he's also confident it's doing people good.  ""good quality sleep is very advantageous in terms of health, and i guess people haven't needed to get up as early,"" he says. there's a benefit in terms of heart disease, but also for the immune system, ""which is really important at the time of an infectious pandemic"".  prof hall does add a note of caution, though: ""i'm sure there's some bad side to this, which might include eating too much chocolate or drinking too much alcohol.""  but if so, the effect doesn't appear to be registering just yet. it may become more visible later.  there is escalating national concern about the heightened risk to black, asian and minority ethnic patients from covid-19.  there are some possible explanations to do with relative poverty, with underlying health problems, with overcrowded housing, and with employment in front-line health and service roles. the suspicion is that there are also genetic factors at play. whatever the reasons, it could have big implications for the future, particularly in the national health service.  there is a real urgency in addressing this concern in a city like bradford, where almost a third of our population and nhs staff are non-white.   john wright  registrar rabeia javid says her eight-year-old son worried at the start of the epidemic, but now admires her choice of career  and the fact that 64% of the covid-positive nhs staff who have died nationwide are bame has caused ripples of anxiety to spread to the hospital.  measuring the risk of death from covid in hospital  people face a number of risks, from exposure and infection, to the risk of ending up in hospital, and then the ultimate risk of dying.  we have looked at the last of these - the risk of dying in hospital - among the first 1,276 patients at bradford royal infirmary who were tested for covid-19.  of the 464 patients who tested positive, mortality was 23%, which is lower than some of the national study results, and crucially we've found no evidence of differences by ethnicity. this is timely and reassuring evidence for our communities.  dr sam khan, consultant in acute medicine, has been ill with covid-19 since 20 march - more than six weeks - and at one point he needed hospital treatment. his main symptoms have been a dry hacking cough and tiredness. he hopes to be well enough to return to work on 15 may.  i asked him what he thought about suggestions that bame staff should be kept away from the front line.   sam khan  acute medicine consultant sam khan and his wife - neither looking worried in this photograph  he points out that that would be very difficult in bradford, and in the nhs generally, because of the large proportion of bame workers in the healthcare system - and that it would be odd to tell people who had trained to be a doctor or nurse that they couldn't see patients because they were black or asian, or from a minority ethnic group.  ""i don't know how you'd do it, you'd have to start thinking differently about recruitment policies,"" he says.  what does it mean for an acute physician like sam in the longer term, bearing in mind that he won't know whether the patients he sees are covid-positive or not.  ""do we start testing everybody as they come through the door, like we're doing for hiv now, where we test the majority of people aged between 18 and 65?"" he asks.  i ask him if he is worried.  ""we don't know how immune i'm going to be in the future,"" he replies. ""yes, it does. it does make me worry. it makes my wife worry more, but it makes me worried.""  follow @docjohnwright on twitter  you may also be interested in:  conspiracy theories have been spreading within parts of the bame community that hospital staff want them to die, reports dr john wright - meanwhile, figures suggest an increase in deaths in bradford outside hospital.  fake news makes patients think we want them to die"
health,"the uk has now overtaken italy to have the highest number of officially recorded coronavirus deaths in europe.  the figures - announced by both governments daily - show a total of 29,427 deaths in the uk and 29,315 in italy.  but can you make a fair comparison between the two countries?  there are challenges around doing this at the moment and here are some of the factors to take into account.  1. population sizes  for a start, the uk's population is roughly 66 million, and italy's is about 60 million.  so the uk would have to register at least 10% more deaths than italy for it to have a higher death rate per person.  given that italy is further past the peak of the outbreak, and is now recording significantly fewer deaths per day than the uk, that may well happen.     2. the two countries may not be counting the same way  the different ways different countries count deaths also need to be considered.  ""every country measures deaths in a different way,"" the uk government's chief medical adviser chris whitty said at one daily briefing, ""so comparing them to each other is a largely fruitless exercise"".  on the face of it, italy and the uk now do it in fairly similar ways - only including confirmed covid-19 cases in their cumulative daily counts.  but while it is safe to assume the figures for the numbers of deaths in hospitals are fairly accurate, can the same be said about deaths in care homes or at home?  there is no national figure in italy for deaths in care homes - the numbers are collated on a regional basis and slightly different measures are being used in different parts of the country.  but, says eleonora perobelli, a researcher at the observatory on long term care in milan, ""the vast majority of officially confirmed covid-19 related deaths are registered in hospitals"".  we do know that the uk figures as of 5 may include more than 4,600 people who died ""in a community setting'""- in other words outside hospital. we also know that there were relatively few tests carried out in care homes until recently.  but in italy, we simply don't know how many of the italian deaths may have occurred outside hospital.  so it is difficult in this case to be confident that we really are comparing like with like.     3. testing  given that the daily figures released by both governments are for people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus, how much testing is going on is clearly important.  to use an extreme example, if neither country had tested any people at all, nobody would have died after testing positive. on the other hand, if everybody in the country had been tested the deaths figure would have been much higher.  the uk is currently testing more people per day than italy, but overall italy, which has been in lockdown longer, has carried out more than 2.2 million tests as of 5 may while the uk has done over 1.3 million.  for daily figures that are based on people who have tested positive for the virus, that is a crucial distinction, which makes comparing the figures problematic.     4. what is the age and health of the population?  the most useful comparison to make between two countries looks at the total number of deaths from all causes adjusted for age.  why would you adjust for age?  we know that coronavirus affects older people more severely than younger people. older people are much more likely to have the underlying health conditions that make coronavirus so much more dangerous.  in the uk for example, in the week to 24 april, we know that coronavirus killed:  four per 100,000 people under the age of 75  75 per 100,000 of the 75-84 group  242 per 100,000 people over 85  italy has fewer young people and more old people percentage of population in three age groups  italy has a higher proportion of older people and a smaller proportion of children (who are much less likely to be severely affected) so, if all other factors were equal, you would expect more coronavirus deaths in italy than the uk.  the other thing you might want to adjust for would be the overall health of the population, which would be relevant for how many people you would expect to die in a given period.  this is usually expressed by giving the number of excess deaths. if you were looking for the number of excess deaths in april, for example, it would be the number of people who have died minus the average number of deaths in april over the previous five years.  it is important to compare with the same period in previous years because we expect more people to die in winter than in summer.  in italy, from 20 february when the first coronavirus death was reported until the end of march, there were 90,946 deaths from all causes, compared with the average of 65,592 for the previous five years - that's an excess of 25,354 deaths.  it would be best to compare that with the six-week period after the first coronavirus death in the uk. the excess deaths figures are published weekly by the ons.  you could take the six weeks starting with the week to 6 march, because that is when the first death occurred. if you do that then you find that 89,735 people died from all causes in the uk, compared with an average of 72,812 in the same period of the previous five years, which is an excess of 16,923.  but you could also start a week later, which is when the first death was registered and so appears in the ons figures. if you do that you get a figure of almost 30,000 excess deaths.  so it is probably too early to make this comparison - it currently only appears to be a measure of how fast the virus spread. given another month of extra data for italy we might be able to make a meaningful comparison.     5. what about population density and other factors?  other factors surrounding the disease - the epidemiology - also have to be taken into account.  it's not just about the size of your population.  you also have to take account of the way that population is distributed around the country, and of relevant characteristics such as underlying health conditions.  we know that the density of population is important for the spreading of coronavirus - it's much more difficult to keep your distance in a crowded area.  overall, the uk is considerably more densely populated, with about 275 people per sq km compared with about 205 in italy.  and the most crowded part of the uk is london, which is western europe's largest and most global city. it's hardly surprising that it has been one of the epicentres of this outbreak.  but if london (population roughly nine million) has been the worst hit region in the uk, then lombardy (population roughly 10 million and more widely dispersed) has been the worst hit region in italy.  figures from the italian statistics agency istat show just how bad things have been in parts of northern italy. deaths in lombardy during march 2020 were 186.5% above the five-year average for that time of year, and in the specific area around the city of bergamo they were 567.6% above the average.  that's higher than in london, and helps explain why the shocking scenes of overcrowding that were seen in some italian hospitals have not been replicated in london hospitals.  but it's also worth emphasising that the virus hit northern italy before it hit the uk, and lombardy had less time to prepare. in parts of southern italy, the number of deaths recorded this year is actually below the five year average.  this piece was originally published on 5 may. it has been updated to add another excess deaths figure.  what claims do you want bbc reality check to investigate?

health,"the government has come under pressure from mps and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing, to make it easier for people to return to work.  but scientists continue to question whether that would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread.  what does the science say?  the simple answer is that the closer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus.  the world health organization says that a distance of 1m is safe. some countries have adopted this guidance, while others, including the uk, have gone further:  1m distancing rule - china, denmark, france, hong kong, lithuania, singapore  1.4m - south korea  1.5m - australia, belgium, germany, greece, italy, netherlands, portugal  1.8m - us  2m - canada, spain, uk  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption the uk government is advising us to stay two metres apart - but what does that look like?  it's not just about distance  timing is also key. the longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk.  scientists advising the uk government say that spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m.  being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance.  what's the latest research?  in a study published in the medical journal the lancet, scientists evaluated recent research into how the coronavirus can spread.  they conclude that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection.  the risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance.  and the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half.  where does the distancing rule come from?  it can be traced back to research in the 1930s.  scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground.  most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m.  that is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face.     can the virus travel further in other ways?  many scientists regard closeness and surface contacts as the main routes of transmission.  but some researchers are concerned that the coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols.  if that is the case, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances.  professor lydia bourouiba from the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m.  and a study carried out at hospitals in china, which found traces of coronavirus in covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance.  but for the us centers for disease control, the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is ""currently uncertain"".  and what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious.  what else makes a difference?  there is wide agreement that the infection is more easily passed on indoors than outside in the fresh air.  japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of covid-19, following up the contacts of the people infected.  they estimated that the odds of the infection being passed on were nearly 19 times greater indoors than when outside.  in many countries, including england and scotland, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"".     why don't we have definite answers?  it is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it.  but there is a long way to go and confirming exactly the right distance is one of the unanswered questions.  it will take careful studies of how the virus can be carried, and how viable it remains, which will all take time."
health,"st george's hospital  dr nigel kennea trained as a doctor for newborn babies and is now focused on helping the bereaved  when dr nigel kennea talks of the ""unexpectedness and awfulness"" of deaths in his hospital in the past six weeks, he tempers it with a positive focus on helping bereaved families left behind.  as a medical examiner at st george's hospital, in south london, his job is to advise clinical teams on completing death certificates, then support relatives through their grief.  but like so much during this pandemic, none of that is straightforward.  ""the most harrowing thing is knowing that many said goodbye to their loved ones in an ambulance,"" he says.  despite staff ""going above and beyond"" to support patients in desperate times, using mobile phones and ipads to connect seriously ill patients and their families, contact is just not always possible.  even after a patient's death, social distancing has meant grieving relatives are left in limbo.  ""normally, registering a death is done face-to-face with relatives,"" dr kennea says.  ""they come in, talk through the admin and how to plan for after death.  ""now, it's all done on the phone.""  'share the burden'  dr kennea's job is to take an overview of all deaths at the hospital. it's a relatively new role in the uk, introduced last year, which is independent of trusts.  previously he was a specialist in the care of newborn babies.  now, dr kennea discusses each death at the hospital with the doctors and nurses involved in that patient's care, making sure death certificates are completed correctly and consistently.     with covid-19 deaths so closely scrutinised, there is added pressure and ""some are complicated"", he says.  there is still so much doctors are learning about the virus and its effects on people's bodies - such as heart failure, thrombosis, kidney problems and pneumonia.  but, dr kennea says: ""if a test for coronavirus has been carried out and is positive, that goes on the death certificate as it is likely to have contributed to the death.""  and the hospital aims to report these deaths to national bodies on the day they happen.  although those that seem unnatural or have no certain cause must be referred to a coroner.  but the role he is most proud of is supporting bereaved families - talking to them about what is on the certificate, the care the patient received and next steps for the funeral.  ""we share the burden together,"" he says.  'human touch'  these conversations with families are when life stories are told and memories shared. there is often laughter too.  and there is now more demand than ever for hospitals to have good communication skills and show sensitivity towards families.  ""we are better at this than we were six weeks ago,"" dr kennea says.   st george's hospital  dr kennea and the medical examiner team contact families after a death  ""so many people are so grateful for our support.  ""and they often say they appreciated the human touch,"" he says.  st george's hospital had its first covid-19 death on 12 march.  since then, 250 people have died with the illness at the hospital, while more than 600 have recovered and been discharged.  in the worst week, 60 patients died with covid-19.  by turning normal wards into intensive care units and training up staff to work there, this large hospital has coped through all the turmoil.  and it has even been able to take covid-19 patients needing dialysis from other london hospitals.  but there has been immense pressure on front-line staff, kitted out in personal protective equipment day in, day out.  when dr kennea goes into covid-19 areas, he too wears full ppe - but it has its limits when communicating with patients.  ""it's hard to share a smile behind a mask and goggles,"" he says.  'violent tragedy'  now, 60 patients with covid-19 are being ventilated in the hospital's intensive care unit.  at the peak, it was 120.  there is a sense the situation is improving and that is ""really gratifying"", dr kennea says.  yet there is so much from the past few months he will never forget.  he has marvelled at human powers of recovery - sometimes in the most unexpected places, such as among the very elderly.  but at the same time, he has seen younger people whose lives have been cruelly taken.  ""it is just a violent tragedy,"" he says.  ""it is such an exceptional time for lives being snatched away."""
health,"video  children make up a small percentage of those so far diagnosed with coronavirus and often have milder reactions than adults when they become infected.  but there are cases around the world where they have been left needing intensive care treatment.  the mothers of four-year-old lincoln, and baby peyton - who contracted the virus at just three weeks old - told the bbc about their experiences.  video by callum tulley"
health,"can you catch coronavirus again? why are some people sicker than others? will it come back every winter? will a vaccine work? could immunity passports get some of us back to work? how do we manage the virus in the long-term?  the immune system is at the heart of some of the most important questions about the coronavirus.  the problem is we know very little.  how do you become immune to coronavirus?  our immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts.  the first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. it is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells.  but this system is not specific to coronavirus. it will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus.  instead you need the adaptive immune response. this includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it and t cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response.  this takes time - studies suggest it takes around 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response.  if the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, then it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future.  it is not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response.  how long does immunity last?  the immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others.  measles is highly memorable - one bout should give life-long immunity (as the weakened version in the mmr vaccine does). however, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. children can get rsv (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter.  the new coronavirus, called sars-cov-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue.  four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. studies showed some patients could be re-infected within a year.  but the common cold is generally mild. there are two more troublesome coronaviruses - the ones that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) - in which antibodies have been detected a few years later.  ""the question is not whether you become immune, it's how long for,"" said paul hunter, a professor in medicine at the university of east anglia.  he added: ""it almost certainly will not last for life.  ""based on antibody studies in sars it is possible that immunity will only last about one to two years, though this is not yet known for certain.""  however, even if you are not completely immune it is possible a second infection would not be as severe.     immunity could affect vaccine research  have people caught it twice?  there have been reports of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time.  some have argued people are genuinely being infected twice. another school of thought is the virus goes into stealth mode in the body before being reactivated.  however, the scientific consensus is that testing is the issue with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus.  nobody has been deliberately reinfected with the virus to test immunity, but a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys have.  they were infected twice, once to build up an immune response and then a second time three weeks later. those very limited experiments showed they did not develop symptoms again after such a quick reinfection.  if i have antibodies am i immune?  this is not guaranteed and that is why the world health organization is nervous about countries using immunity passports as a way out of lockdown.  the idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. this would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms.  but while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. a study of 175 recovered patients in china showed 30% had very low levels of these neutralising antibodies.  that is why the world health organization says ""that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery"".  another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others.  why does immunity matter?  it matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get covid-19 multiple times and how often.  immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. if people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous.  understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus.  if it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot.  and the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading.  these are all big questions we still lack answers to.  follow james on twitter"
health,"john wright  planned surgery has been cancelled at hospitals across the uk, leaving much work to be done once the covid-19 emergency is over. but two colorectal surgeons at bradford royal infirmary also believe that the surgical world will be permanently changed - as dr john wright discovers in his regular diary.  27 april 2020  like a runner who has discovered halfway through her race that it has changed from a sprint to a marathon, the hospital is coming to terms with a new pace and is recalibrating its stamina.  numbers of cases have started to fall, but there's no finishing line in sight.  and as we continue running, we have to look ahead to the future - we have to work out how we can resume normal business, looking after patients with cancer and heart disease, asthma and arthritis.  at present, half the hospital is empty, while the other half has become a covid-19 red zone; in time it will contain two parallel universes, covid and non-covid.  surgeons, who have concentrated on emergency operations since the start of the epidemic, will resume planned operations in the non-covid universe. but until a reliable test is developed that can be used to confirm that a patient is covid-negative, the assumption will have to be that they are covid-positive, and this has some important consequences.  i spoke to two consultant colorectal surgeons, sonia lockwood and frankie mosley, about what has changed for them so far, and what they think will change in future.  they confirmed that all work except for emergency surgery and some cancer surgery has been put on hold. they also said that keyhole surgery has come to a halt, as evidence from china and some european countries suggests that open surgery is safer for operating theatre staff.  front line diary  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research, and a veteran of cholera, hiv and ebola epidemics in sub-saharan africa. he is writing this diary for bbc news and recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's the nhs front line  it may now resume, in some cases, with the increased risk to medical staff being weighed against the risks to the patient of a longer stay in hospital, which is one of the consequences of open surgery.  but increased efforts will also be made to explore non-surgical options. appendicitis provides a good example of this, sonia says.  ""we are looking to treat people conservatively, with antibiotics wherever we can. we're doing more complex scanning on patients to try and determine who will be suitable for that. so we're really avoiding operating on patients wherever possible.""  and appendicitis also illustrates another point - people who really need treatment are not always coming to hospital.  ""where we would normally do appendectomies maybe once a day, maybe two or three a day, at first, after the lockdown, we didn't see any. but then, after a week or so, the patients that are coming in with appendicitis have come in with terrible appendicitis,"" sonia says.  ""they've waited at home until it's perforated, so what would have been a relatively straightforward illness and operation then becomes a much more significant illness and operation.""  normally, there would be a minimum of about 30 admissions coming through the hospital's surgical assessment unit every day but that went down to two or three, sonia says.   john wright  wearing full ppe is tiring, and tight-fitting masks can cause headaches  the surgeons are also dealing with fewer cancer patients.  in some cases this is because a calculation has been made that the risk of bringing them in is higher than the risking of waiting. but there is another factor too, frankie says.  ""we certainly, at the moment, aren't diagnosing many cancers at all. our main modality for diagnosing them is endoscopy - colon endoscopy [a camera inserted into the body on the end of a tube] - and we've more or less ceased that activity,"" she says.  ""we are investigating people - we're scanning them, so we'll pick up the most advanced cancers - but we're not diagnosing anywhere near the normal numbers. so we are just putting this work off for later.""  but operations carried out in full personal protective equipment (ppe), as they must be until there is a test for covid-19, are time-consuming.  ""what we may have been able to do six months ago, in a given day, we can only do half of that - and that's if we get all the theatres back, and all the ventilators back,"" frankie says.   each patient at bradford royal infirmary who leaves hospital after recovering from covid-19 is commemorated with a heart  the same applies to diagnostic tests - x-rays, camera tests, endoscopy - everything will take longer because of safety procedures that have been put in place in for both patients and staff.  and this, combined with the fact that there will be a backlog of operations, will lead inevitably to more prioritisation, sonia and frankie believe.  at present, cancer surgery is a top priority, and for everyone else it's been first come first served, as frankie puts it. in future they envisage pushing lower-priority operations down the queue.  what does that mean in the case of colorectal surgery?  ""for us it will be some of people's haemorrhoid operations. they might have to put up with bleeding - it is inconvenient and unpleasant, but they might have to put up with it for a bit longer than they traditionally have had to,"" frankie says.  sonia adds that when it comes to general surgery, some hernia patients could be de-prioritised.  ""while they've got lumps and bumps that are maybe uncomfortable and they've got some symptoms, most people have very mild symptoms,"" she says.  the remarkable drop off we've seen in hospital referrals, has been matched when it comes to a&e attendances. while we're worried about the patients who may not be coming to hospital when they need to, this also suggests that people who are using a&e have not always experienced an accident or an emergency.  ""there are lots of people who use the nhs inappropriately, acknowledging that it's quicker to come to a&e and wait for hours than maybe wait for a gp appointment two weeks from now,"" sonia says. ""and i think the covid crisis has actually highlighted that - that people are trying to bypass the system.""  in an nhs which is struggling to meet ever increasing demand, we have an opportunity to reduce unnecessary hospital appointments - to do things differently. patients have discovered the joys of seeing their consultant without leaving the comfort of their own homes, and remote or virtual consultations look like one of the big changes that are here to stay.  the success of our response to covid-19 in hospitals across the uk has been down to a grassroots movement of doctors and nurses on the front line. they have been the ones who have taken control of the nhs, put their lives on the line and tamed the covid dragon.  this has broken down a barrier between clinical and managerial staff in hospitals, sonia says, and she looks forward to a continuation of open dialogue as we plan for the future.  in management theory, there's a classical model about change that describes how to unfreeze the existing system and then refreeze it in a new way of working. it's a neat concept but in reality this never happens. until now. covid-19 has defrosted the whole of the nhs, and we have to now work out what we want to keep and what we want to do differently.  follow @docjohnwright on twitter"
health,"phil rossall  phil rossall, a 67-year-old retired teacher and charity worker from kent, was first diagnosed with motor neurone disease (mnd) in 2016.  at the time, doctors told him he had just ""one or two"" years left to live.  four years have passed since his diagnosis, and he is now unable to move his limbs or breathe without a ventilator.  but he has refused to let the disease break his spirit, and last year managed to smash two guinness world records for running marathons in his wheelchair.  phil says that it has become difficult to keep track of how far his disease has progressed: ""i don't notice day-to-day changes, but then looking back to the start of this year is a scary experience for me,"" he told the bbc.  mnd is a degenerative and often fast-progressing disease. due to its nature, those with the condition have a heightened risk of complications if they catch a respiratory infection like covid-19.  phil and his partner, brenda, have been self-isolating for the last month.  ""the enforced isolation has meant that my blog and book have been the main respite from a world of hoists, wheelchairs and face masks,"" he said.  ""my speech is now completely incomprehensible, so writing is now my only form of communication with the outside world. i miss my st christopher's carers and the mnd association visitors, but my heart goes out to people who are desperately ill and who feel deserted by their own government.""  'mixed messages'  despite relying on a ventilator to breathe, phil was not initially included in the government's list of who should be shielding. he says that the government's advice since the coronavirus outbreak began has felt like a succession of ""mixed messages"" that left him and his partner unsure of his situation.  ""i have two postgraduate degrees and have worked as a research manager, and yet i have been very confused,"" he said. ""seeing that i have a debilitating condition and that i am reliant on ventilation 24/7, i was expecting to be included, but instead i was not in the 1.5 million most vulnerable in the country. all i can say is that there must be an awful lot of very sick people out there.""  while the disease is on the nhs england list of underlying health conditions, it has yet to be explicitly named on the list of those who should be ""shielding"".  the advice on whether mnd patients should be on the shielding list has said it depends on the stage of their illness.   phil rossall  phil doesn't know why mnd isn't included on the ""most vulnerable"" list  the mnd association, a charity dedicated to the care and protection of those living with the disease, told the bbc it had been inundated with concerned and upset patients and families.  ""many are terrified of catching coronavirus, knowing the implications for them could be catastrophic,"" said head of policy and campaigns, susie rabin.  she said more than 3,500 of the charity's supporters had emailed their mps urging them to ask health secretary matt hancock to add mnd to the ""extremely vulnerable"" list.  ""not being automatically added to the extremely clinically vulnerable shielding and protecting list, means that people are struggling to get food and essential medicines delivered, particularly if they live alone.  ""people with mnd have died of covid 19 already. we'd like all people with mnd shielded and protected from this disease.  ""we believe that inclusion on the 'extremely vulnerable' list is the safest and most appropriate option for people with mnd.  ""there needs to be more support for social care workers and much more adequate provision of ppe for carers both in care homes and in domestic settings to enable them to support and care for disabled people.""  'vital service'  as his primary carer, phil's partner is unable to leave him alone in the house. because of this, the couple have come to rely on a delivery service from their local supermarket over the last three years.  however, due to not being classed as ""extremely vulnerable"" by the government, the couple were told that they were not eligible for a delivery slot.  ""the fact remains that i was receiving a vital service until the 'extremely vulnerable' rules came in. whether the omission of mnd from the official shielding list was a result of incompetence, ignorance or prejudice, doesn't matter to me.  ""i will not go hungry. but for the first time in my life, i feel i am a victim of discrimination. i never get angry. i may be wrong, but i feel like i don't count, that i belong to a group that's not worth bothering about because we'll be dead soon anyway.""  he felt forced to take matters into his own hands, and only after he had asked his consultant to send a supporting letter to his gp, did he finally receive the phone call to tell him he had been placed on the list.  case-by-case basis  a spokesman for the department of health and social care told the bbc that patients with mnd are being assessed on an individual basis.  ""expert doctors have identified specific medical conditions that put someone at greatest risk of severe illness from covid-19, meaning they're clinically extremely vulnerable and need to shield.  ""the list will continue to be reviewed, and doctors are identifying additional people who need to shield depending on their individual circumstances.""  those who are not classified as ""extremely vulnerable"", but have underlying health conditions, are still advised to adhere to stay-at-home guidelines, he added.  despite his victory, phil says he's concerned that others like him may not be so lucky.  ""i am still concerned that other people with this terrible disease do not have the support i have.""  he added: ""i am still angry that the government advisers forgot some of the most vulnerable people in the country and ignored our pleas for so long. surely it shouldn't be so hard."""
health,"simon is one of many autistic people left isolated by coronavirus  for most people the covid-19 crisis is an unsettling, confusing time. but for hundreds of thousands of adults with autism in the uk the problems are acute.  families and charities say this vulnerable group has been forgotten in the pandemic and they are often not receiving the care they need. here some of them describe what things have been like since the lockdown began.  'sick with worry'  in a few weeks simon will be 53. he was diagnosed with autism when he was three and has been in residential care his whole life.  he has very limited communication but can say when he wants a cup of tea. in normal times, he would go riding and swimming once a week.  ""he's a very active young man,"" says his mother andrea. ""and to me he's still a young man.""  but two weeks ago simon fell ill, with a high temperature and severe cough.  ""i just felt sick with worry,"" andrea says. ""i mean what's going to happen to him if he is so ill he has to go into hospital?""  despite having typical symptoms, like thousands of others, simon has not been tested for coronavirus and andrea is not allowed to see him.  she has nothing but praise for the care home staff but says: ""no doctors will come and that is the whole problem. we don't know what we are dealing with.  ""it's been terrible - probably the most stressful week in my life.""   simon's mum says he would struggle to cope if he had to be taken to hospital  simon has no way of communicating how he's feeling, whether he's getting better or worse, and no way of processing what is happening to him.  ""i can't imagine what he's thinking,"" andrea says.  ""even his favourite cup of tea has disappeared because they are giving him cold drinks to keep his temperature down. he can't even say to someone, i'd really love to have a cup of tea.""  under nhs guidelines if someone with autism or a learning disability does need hospital treatment for covid-19 then a single family member or carer can visit.  but andrea still thinks simon would struggle to cope.  ""he would be absolutely terrified,"" she says. ""most hospitals have very, very limited staff who can deal with autism and learning disabilities. i just don't know what would happen.""  she says simon's condition has started to improve and he is now eating small amounts and sitting in the garden with a drink.  'what protection do i have?'  david* was diagnosed with autism and multiple learning disabilities as a child. now in his 50s, he's spent the last 30 years living in three different residential care homes.  he is worried about what will happen if the virus spreads in the home and says people like him have been forgotten.  ""testing should be done daily on residents and care workers,"" he says.  ""if my care workers get it or other residents get it, i'm stuck. what protection do i have? i am concerned about the lack of ppe for all care providers not just my own.""   christopher's two long-term carers have resigned, leaving him without the care he 'desperately needs'  like many people with autism, christopher finds it hard to handle the unpredictable.  ""he gets very confused, very frustrated, with any form of change to his timetable or his daily routines,"" says his mother jane. ""so when situations like this arise you get a lot of anxiety from him.""  christopher lives on his own, in his own house. he has two long-term carers who help with meals, cleaning, personal care and other everyday tasks he can't do alone, but last month they both had to resign - one for health reasons, the other to look after their own children - leaving him with no support.  and because jane lives with another vulnerable person, lockdown means she isn't able to help her son face-to-face.  ""everything has to be done within his drive, keeping the two metre distance,"" she says. ""but that means we can't provide the personal care he desperately, desperately needs.""  if - as seems likely - the lockdown continues for weeks, perhaps months, jane fears it could be ""catastrophic"" for her son.  ""the longer this goes on, the more anxious he's becoming, the more unconfident he's becoming, the more he's losing what we've built up with him over the years.  ""he's a 40-year-old young man who has lots to give. he's an absolute treasure, but i'm so worried about this time for him.""  'i'm afraid he'll lose his social skills'  living in supported accommodation, james* has been used to receiving regular visits from his care workers.  but since the coronavirus outbreak his contact has been limited to brief phone calls or a knock at the door.  he has asperger syndrome and has recently been discharged from hospital where he was a patient for over 10 years.  ""gradually he's staying in more, not seeing or speaking to anyone, staying up all night and in bed for a huge part of the day,"" says his mother kathy.  ""i'm afraid that he's going to lose all his social skills again and get very depressed, ending up back in hospital.""  because of her age, kathy is having to self-isolate so can only contact her son by email or video call.  ""he keeps saying 'what's the point of living if we're in lockdown'.  ""he's relying more and more on me for mental support rather than turning to his team. so i'm on the receiving end of the brunt of his frustrations. i'll be very glad when the lockdown is over and he can get the full support he needs.""  jane harris, director of external affairs at the national autistic society, says ""autistic people often have communication difficulties. that means that it's harder to understand what is going on in the first place.  ""but also autistic people don't often have the best support networks to start with so it's really, really hard for them to get support in a crisis, things like shopping or even just a phone call just to check that somebody is okay.

health,"millions of people around the world will be observing the muslim holy month of ramadan under lockdown this year.  each year, many practising muslims fast from dawn to sunset for the whole of the lunar month - either 29 or 30 days - as part of the ritual of dedicating oneself to contemplation and prayer.  fasting is obligatory for all adult followers of the faith who are able to safely go without food and drink.  but there are some considerations when it comes to fasting during a pandemic.  fighting infection takes a lot of energy, university of sussex immunologist dr jenna macciochi says.  and prolonged periods of not eating or drinking can weaken the immune system.  so it is important to make sure you get enough calories during the hours you are permitted to eat, including enough:  macronutrients - carbohydrates, proteins and fats  micronutrients, such as vitamin c and iron  and it is a good idea to eat a variety of food, including lots of different coloured vegetables, fruits, pulses and legumes.  both under- and over-eating can affect the immune system, so you can help yourself by staying in ""energy balance"", according to dr macciochi.  there is also some risk in becoming dehydrated, as it can affect the mucus that lines your airways and acts as a protective barrier.  but looking after other aspects of your health by trying to get enough sleep and exercise and de-stressing where possible can help keep your immune system functioning as it should.  more simply though, the best way to protect your health is preventing exposure to the virus.  much of the risk can be avoided by handwashing and, for those who can, staying at home.  what about people with health conditions?  people who are ill, including those with covid-19, are exempt from fasting.  and it is not recommended for people with certain long-term conditions such as diabetes with complications.  diabetes uk head of care daniel howarth said the decision was ""absolutely a personal reflection"" but there were some precautions people with well managed conditions who wanted to fast could take, including eating slower-release carbohydrates, such as wholegrain bread and rice, and testing your blood sugar more often.  what about healthcare workers?  the muslim council of britain has published guidance, saying ""healthcare staff required to provide care to covid-19 patients, at real risk of dehydration and making clinical errors due to wearing ppe [personal protective equipment] and long shifts"" are exempt from fasting.  can fasting be good for your health?  although not consuming enough calories in a day can lower your immune response, the effect of fasting on the immune system is not straightforward.  the immune system is not one thing with an on/off switch.  it is a complicated series of mechanisms that have to be kept in balance.  fasting releases the stress hormone cortisol, which can suppress some immune responses.  but there is also good evidence from studies in mice that intermittent fasting of the kind practised during ramadan can speed up the body's process of regeneration, causing old cells to die and be replaced with new ones.  however, it is difficult to translate this evidence to humans.  and it is not clear how long you would have to fast to replicate the effect.  follow rachel on twitter"
health,"more than one million people around the world are known to have recovered from coronavirus, according to johns hopkins university. but the road back to full health is not the same for everyone.  recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others it could leave lasting problems.  age, gender and other health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from covid-19.  the more invasive the treatment you receive, and the longer it is performed, the longer recovery is likely to take.  what if i have only mild symptoms?  most people who get covid-19 will develop only the main symptoms - a cough or fever. but they could experience body aches, fatigue, sore throat and headache.  the cough is initially dry, but some people will eventually start coughing up mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.  these symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and pain relief such as paracetamol.     people with mild symptoms should make a good and speedy recovery.  the fever should settle in less than a week, although the cough may linger. a world health organization (who) analysis of chinese data says it takes two weeks on average to recover.  what if i have more serious symptoms?  the disease can become much more serious for some. this tends to happen about seven to 10 days into the infection.  the transformation can be sudden. breathing becomes difficult and the lungs get inflamed. this is because although the body's immune system is trying to fight back - it's actually overreacting and the body experiences collateral damage.  some people will need to be in hospital for oxygen therapy.  gp sarah jarvis says: ""the shortness of breath may take some considerable time to improve... the body is getting over scarring and inflammation.""  she says it could take two to eight weeks to recover, with tiredness lingering.  what if i need intensive care?  the who estimates one person in 20 will need intensive care treatment, which can include being sedated and put on a ventilator.  it will take time to recover from any spell in an intensive or critical care unit (icu), no matter what the illness. patients are moved to a regular ward before going home.  dr alison pittard, dean of the faculty of intensive care medicine, says it can take 12 to 18 months to get back to normal after any spell in critical care.  spending a long time in a hospital bed leads to muscle mass loss. patients will be weak and muscle will take time to build up again. some people will need physiotherapy to walk again.     coronavirus rehabilitation in france  because of what the body goes through in icu, there's also the possibility of delirium and psychological disorders.  ""there does seem to be an added element with this disease - viral fatigue is definitely a huge factor,"" says paul twose, critical care physiotherapist at cardiff and vale university health board.  there have been reports from china and italy of whole-body weakness, shortness of breath after any level of exertion, persistent coughing and irregular breathing. plus needing a lot of sleep.  ""we do know patients take a considerable period, potentially months, to recover.""  but it is hard to generalise. some people spend relatively short periods in critical care, while others are ventilated for weeks.  will coronavirus affect my health long-term?  we don't know for sure as there is no long-term data, but we can look at other conditions.  acute respiratory distress syndrome (called ards) develops in patients whose immune systems go into overdrive, causing damage to the lungs.  ""there is really good data that, even five years down the line, people can have ongoing physical and psychological difficulties,"" says mr twose.  dr james gill, a gp and lecturer at warwick medical school, says people also need mental health support to improve recovery.  ""you're finding breathing difficult, then the doctor says 'we need to put you on a ventilator. we need to put you to sleep. do you want to say goodbye to your family?'.  ""ptsd [post-traumatic stress disorder] in these most severe patients is not unsurprising. there will be significant psychological scars for many.""  there remains the possibility that even some mild cases may leave patients with long-term health problems - such as fatigue.  how many people have recovered?  getting an accurate figure is difficult.  as of 1 may, johns hopkins university reported more than 1,021,000 people had recovered out of 3.2 million people known to have been infected around the world.     a covid-19 gives prostration of thanks on leaving hospital in morocco  but countries use different recording methods. some are not publishing recovery figures and many mild infections will be missed.  mathematical models have estimated between 99-99.5% of people recover.  can i catch covid-19 again?  there has been much speculation, but little evidence, on how durable any immunity is. if patients have successfully fought off the virus, they must have built up an immune response.  reports of patients being infected twice may just be down to tests incorrectly recording they were free of the virus.  the immunity question is vital for understanding whether people can be reinfected and how effective any vaccine may be.  follow james on twitter"
health,"elizabeth faces a recovery period of up to six months - but feels she has been given a second chance  elizabeth, 49, knows she is lucky to be alive. after falling seriously ill with covid-19, she was admitted to hospital earlier this month. this is her story, which she chose to tell partly to thank the hospital staff who treated her.  the first hint i had that something wasn't right was on a friday.  i felt more tired than normal and by the time i went to bed i was exhausted. that was a particularly tough weekend.  on the monday, i started getting pains in my legs, which became excruciating. i thought it was a trapped nerve and took some paracetamol but the doctors later told me the virus had gone directly into my muscles. i had a cough but it wasn't persistent, which people think is always the sign. i was bed-bound for over a week but then once i did get out - to the local petrol station to get some provisions - that was when it hit me.  i got back home feeling freezing cold and shivering. at one point i had four hot water bottles on the sofa and two blankets and i just could not get warm.  then the fever set in.  it felt like my body was on fire, and i was getting splitting headaches. i couldn't eat anything, i was vomiting and absolutely wringing wet with sweat, and then my breathing started to get more difficult.  i'm asthmatic and that really worried me, but i still thought i could ride this out at home. within a few more days i was slipping in and out of consciousness and i have vague recollections of my 15-year-old son telling me he'd called 111 [the nhs non-emergency helpline] for me. the paramedics arrived and i remember hearing one radio the ambulance driver outside saying: ""she's very poorly, we need to bring her in."" he put an oxygen mask on me and carried me out to the vehicle.  one of my kids had called my mother, june, and she was there watching. that was one of the hardest things: seeing the look of helplessness on her face. but she couldn't come close because she has a heart condition and is at high risk if she catches the virus.  when we arrived at hospital, we were in a queue of ambulances just waiting to off-load patients at a&e. i was lying there for about three hours until it was our turn. they put me in a wheelchair and i remember them saying they had no cubicles, they were full to capacity.  i sat there with my eyes closed listening to everything - people rushing around, phones ringing, general commotion.  the nurse said: ""i have to swab you for covid-19."" he stuck the swab stick so far down the back of my throat that i was retching, and then just as i was recovering, he said: ""now i have to do it up your nostrils."" that was followed by a raft of blood tests and a chest x-ray.  i felt pummelled. all i could think was ""what the hell's going on?"" i felt like passing out. i remember another nurse coming over and telling me: ""just to let you know, your x-ray results have come back - you've got pneumonia in the lungs and you'll have to be on oxygen 24/7.""  at one point, i felt the most almighty pain in my chest, like i was being compressed with slabs of concrete. they told me it was the pneumonia attacking my lungs and they gave me a shot of morphine. that was followed by terrible stabbing pains in my stomach, as bad as labour contractions, and i cried out: ""i can't take this anymore! i can't carry on!"" by the time the pains subsided, i was almost delirious.  there were only four beds in my bay, and everyone in there had tested positive for covid-19 and had an underlying health issue. two other women already in there were diabetic, and a third woman was brought in opposite me after a couple of days.  i don't remember much of the first few days, just nurses coming in and out all the time, and cleaners coming in to disinfect everything. most of the noise was from me ringing the bell and gasping for drinks of water. i was so weak it's all i could manage to say, that and ""commode"". i was watching the nurses - they were all working a minimum of 12-hour shifts. you could just see they were absolutely exhausted.  one night, i saw a man in what was meant to be our all-female ward. i rang the bell and the nurse came and explained he was the son of the woman in the bed opposite me and that she was an ""end-of-life"" patient. i felt dreadfully sad for them but at the same time was thinking: ""so i've got somebody who's about six feet from me who's basically waiting to die and i'm going to hear it."" they had the curtains pulled round our beds so we did have a modicum of privacy.  that was when i started hallucinating. i was getting flashbacks of conversations i'd had in my life and people i'd met. at one point i thought: ""am i alive or dead? do these flashbacks mean i'm transitioning to death? is this what people mean when they talk about your life passing before you when you die?"" and then i'm saying: ""no, i don't think actually i am dead, because there's no white light and no angels and nobody calling me.""  then all of a sudden - it was the early hours - i heard a male nurse outside the door say: ""she's gone."" the poor woman opposite me had died.  i waited for them to come in and remove her body, but nothing happened. that lady's body was there for what seemed like hours before they eventually came in. they were cleaning it and then they're wrapping it in plastic, like packaging. then i heard them put her in a body bag, zip it up and say: ""on the count of three… one… two… three.""  the noise of that body coming into contact with a metal trolley - that's a sound you don't forget.  someone started cleaning where the woman had been and sprayed lemon scent to try to freshen up the smell. by daytime i was just looking at an empty bed. the day before, i'd been looking at somebody and now the bed was empty. that thought really affected me.  i started watching the woman in the bed diagonal to me. she slipped into a coma, and i watched her daughter come and say desperately: ""mum, it's me! mum, it's me!"", and it was pitiful because the woman was already ""gone"". it sounds awful but i was waiting for her for two nights to actually die, which was very distressing. the woman next to me was getting better and she commented that we were in a bay where 50% had died and 50% had lived and that we were on the lucky side of the room.  i had fought to stay alive. after being almost ready to give up at the start, i had told myself: ""no, i've got to carry on, i'm not going yet. i'm 49, i'm not ready to die, not just for me but for my kids and my family and friends."" my sister, lorraine, and my brother, richard, had texted me constantly with love and support, and that gave me the will to fight it.  it was 8 april and i remember seeing the full moon and thinking to myself that this was the start of a new lunar cycle and i'm going to take this as a sign i'm on the road to recovery.  unfortunately the comatose woman died after two days and again i heard the same process. the plastic, the zipping, the trolley and the cleaning.  what saved my life perhaps was one male nurse who said to me: ""if the doctors say you're medically fit to go home - go! don't make the mistake of staying in hospital because you feel a bit weak. believe me, i've seen it on this ward - every patient who's been told by doctors 'you can go home' and have argued saying they don't feel 100% and just want one more night in hospital - every one of them has contracted a secondary illness, because this is a high-risk covid ward and they've all died.""  that same day, they tested my blood oxygen saturation levels and i scraped by. the doctor said: ""you've just made it. i'm happy to discharge you"". i was so excited - i was going home.  it was freezing outside. i only had a hospital gown and flip flops on, but i could feel the air on my face and i was elated. i don't know the name of the female ambulance driver but she was an angel - she had started her shift at 06:00, and she was picking me up at 00:20 - she'd done an 18-hour day.  this is what these people are doing. it's not just the nurses and doctors. it's the people who are driving the ambulances. it's the paramedic crews. it's the woman at the desk doing the admin. it's the man coming in cleaning up after a dead body. it's the porter taking it down to the morgue.  every single person is playing their part. i have written to the ambulance service and the hospital to thank them for their incredible care and dedication.  i'm bed-bound for the next few weeks and the doctors said it could take three to six months to get over the pneumonia. since leaving hospital, my mother has been my lifeline, leaving me food parcels on my doorstep.  i touched death and i'm very lucky to be alive. what i'm now looking forward to is appreciating nature. you realise material things don't matter. when i get outside i want to breathe the air, look at birds and enjoy the natural beauty of the world.  i've been given a second chance.  interview by raffi berg"
health,"alamy  about a quarter of known coronavirus deaths in great britain have happened in care homes, with prime minister boris johnson saying he ""bitterly regrets"" the epidemic and that the government is ""working very hard"" to tackle it.  how many deaths have there been in care homes?  up to 1 may, there had been 8,312 deaths in care homes in england and wales where coronavirus was written on the death certificate, according to the office for national statistics (ons).  this represents a quarter of all deaths associated with the virus to that date.  the number increases to 12,526 when care home residents who died outside care homes - such as in hospital - are included.  in scotland, 1,438 people had died in care homes - or 45% of all deaths.  northern ireland currently does not produce similar breakdowns.  the ons statistics provide the most detailed breakdown of deaths in england and wales, but because of the challenge of collecting accurate data from 15,000 care homes, they are on a two-week lag.  however, care homes have been hit by an alarming increase in ""excess deaths"".  these are the number of deaths above the average for the same period in the preceding five years.  while on average april sees about 8,400 deaths in care homes - this year there have been 26,563 deaths in england and wales, so about 18,000 more than expected.  with only 8,000 of these attributed to coronavirus on death certificates, questions have been raised about what has contributed to the other 10,000 deaths.  why has coronavirus hit care homes so hard?  according to health guidance, care homes are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease for three main reasons:  infections are able to spread quickly because of close contact between residents  carers can unintentionally spread the infection where there isn't appropriate protection  residents are often elderly and have other underlying diseases  more than one in three deaths from coronavirus in great britain have been people aged over 85, despite representing just over 2% of the population.  at least 60% of the elderly care home population is aged 85 and over.  what is the problem with ppe?  the government's advice to care homes on personal protective equipment (ppe) is almost identical to that given to hospital workers - they should have single-use disposable gloves, aprons and face masks.  for weeks, care providers have been saying that it is difficult to get enough of these items to keep their staff and clients safe.  the government has said 131 social care staff have died from coronavirus. separately, the ons has estimated that care staff are twice as likely to die as healthcare workers.  more than 1.2 billion pieces of ppe have been delivered to health and care settings in england, according to the government.  the government has also released £3.6bn of funding to local authorities - which are in charge of providing social care - with instructions that most of this should reach the adult social care sector.  however, the local government association has warned that with less income available from business rates and parking charges, the funding might not be enough to cover additional costs to tackle the virus.  getty how many work in care? numbers for england, 2018 1.2madult social care workers giving direct care 465,000 in care and nursing homes  610,000 provide care at people's homes  150,000provide day and community care source: skills for care  how many tests are being carried out in care homes?  there is no regular breakdown, but the government has now announced that as laboratory capacity increases, all care home residents who develop symptoms will be tested.  patients returning to care homes from hospitals are also meant to be tested for covid-19, even if they have no symptoms.  the government says all elderly care home staff and residents will have been offered tests by 6 june.  are staff being tested?  testing was made available to care staff on 15 april.  the care sector has always struggled to recruit enough staff because of its reputation for low pay and a lack of recognition - it's estimated that there are currently 122,000 full-time equivalent vacancies in england.  those problems have been made more acute with staff having to self-isolate if they or a member of their family has shown potential coronavirus symptoms.  to prevent the virus spreading between care homes, the government has requested that staff do not work in more than one care home.  but many care staff are on zero-hours contracts or work for agencies, meaning they go wherever there is demand for carers.  the government said on 15 april it aimed to recruit 20,000 extra social care staff over three months.  how many people live in care homes?  most care homes in the uk are privately run, and there is no official data on the exact number of residents.  the cqc says there are 15,517 residential and nursing homes providing support for older and disabled people in england, with an estimated 457,361 beds available.  occupancy rates seem to be about 90% which would suggest there are about 411,000 people living in care homes in england and wales.  how many people receive care in their own homes?  each week in the uk, it is estimated that 540,000 people receive support in their own home. that adds up to a million home-care visits each day.  what's provided on these visits can range from help going to the toilet, to preparing a meal or support with medication.  care workers can at times see up to 20 clients during a day. this has raised concerns about the danger of spreading coronavirus if the workers do not have enough ppe."
health,"afp  the who headquarters in geneva  president donald trump has said he is going to halt us funding to the world health organization (who) because it had ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.  but what is the who and what does it do?  it's the global health hq  a wash of colour overhead greets anyone entering the who headquarters in geneva where the 194 flags of the organisation's member states drape from the ceiling as - on sunny days, at least - beams of light flood the large open atrium.  this is from where the global response to what's been described as ""the greatest test to the world since world war two""- is being co-ordinated.  the un agency was founded in 1948, and describes itself as the ""global guardian of public health"".  its stated goal is to ensure ""the highest attainable level of health for all people"".  it's a big job.  over the last 11 years, it has overseen the global response to six international health emergencies, including the ebola outbreak in west africa in 2014, the zika outbreak in 2016 and - right now - the covid-19 pandemic.  it also  decides when to sound the ""global alarm"" during outbreaks  sets up worldwide research and development plans aimed at fast-tracking new treatments and vaccines  sends experts into the epicentres of disease in order to gather data on what works and what doesn't  the who also has responsibility for a wide range of other health issues, including  tackling the global obesity and diabetes epidemics  reducing deaths on the roads  wiping out vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio  working to reduce the number of mothers and babies who die during childbirth.  but - and it's a big but - the who is an advisory-only body. it can make recommendations to countries on what to do to improve the health of its citizens and prevent the outbreak of disease, but it can't enforce those recommendations.  has the who mishandled this pandemic?  it depends on who you ask.  if you ask donald trump, the answer is a resounding yes.  but mr trump himself is facing withering criticism of how he has dealt with the outbreak in the us - which now has more than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths.  he also has a bigger geopolitical fight with china, which far precedes covid-19.  however, the us leader is certainly not the first to criticise the who for its effusive praise of china's response to the outbreak which continued even while others - including medics in the country - described how their early concerns about the virus were silenced by the authorities.  dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, director general of the who, has repeatedly said he stands by his praise of china.  he says its response helped slow the spread of the virus internationally, buying other countries time to prepare for what was coming.  and he, along with many other scientists, points out that china voluntarily shared the genetic code of the virus very quickly, allowing countries to start making diagnostic tests and working on vaccines.  however, there has also been widespread criticism of the country's response.  devi sridhar, professor of global public health at the university of edinburgh, said: ""china didn't do a great job of telling the world [about the early stages of the outbreak] and it's clear there were delays.  ""they tried to downplay this in the early days.""  prof sridhar investigated the who's much-criticised response to the west africa ebola epidemic, and describes herself as one of the who's ""harshest critics"".  but she added: ""it's hard to fault a lot of what the who has been trying to do, given the difficult balancing act of trying to get countries to address this epidemic and take it seriously, while also trying to keep all countries at the table.""  a major part of the who's role is diplomacy. because it can't force countries to share information about outbreaks, it relies on nations themselves coming forward.  prof sridhar said the organisation could have got its ""five minutes of fame"" around the world if dr tedros had issued a strong condemnation of china, she says, but that could have hampered the global response to covid-19.  ""what would that have achieved? he still needs to go back a week later and ask china to share data.""  she believes the who did put pressure on china to be more up-front in the early days of the outbreak - but that it did so behind the scenes.  ""i think there's a big difference in diplomacy, between doing things publicly with the media - which is often just a performance, to make a posture - and to do things privately and actually advocate and get things moving.""  what happened in previous outbreaks?  this isn't the first time the who has faced criticism.     the who was criticised for its ""slow"" response to the outbreak of ebola in west africa  the un agency was deemed to be slow to respond to the 2014 ebola outbreak, declaring an international emergency only five months after the virus was first identified in guinea.  but in 2009, it was accused of the opposite - being quick to over-react on the h1n1 swine-flu outbreak, and unnecessarily declaring a global pandemic.  last week, when president trump floated the idea of withholding funding to the who, dr tedros called for countries not to ""politicise this virus.""  he also said he welcomed a review of the who's response to the outbreak because ""we want to learn from our mistakes, from our strengths and move forward"".  but he said the focus now should be on ""fighting this virus"".  what impact could president trump's move have?  the us is the biggest single donor to the who, which relies on a combination of members' fees - based on wealth and population - and voluntary contributions.  those voluntary donations make up most of the agency's $2.2bn (£1.75bn) annual budget.  last year the us gave more than $400m.  dr jeremy farrar, director of the uk's wellcome trust, said the who needs ""more resources, not less"" to tackle the pandemic.  ""we are facing the greatest challenge of our lifetime. no other organisation can do what they do.  ""this is a time for solidarity, not division.""  and prof sridhar said the us was ""cutting off its nose to spite its face"".  ""if who is hampered by this - its ability to respond to covid, but also to malaria, and tb and polio is hampered, too - we're going to see the resurgence of all kinds of diseases that we thought were in the past."""
health,"the state of emergency is to be extended to the whole of japan  it was once seen as something of a success story - a region that worked to contain, trace and isolate the virus - leading to a huge drop in numbers. but hokkaido is in the spotlight again as it struggles to deal with a second wave of infections.  in late february, hokkaido became the first place in japan to declare a state of emergency due to covid-19.  schools were closed, large-scale gatherings cancelled and people ""encouraged"" to stay at home. the local government pursued the virus with determination - aggressively tracing and isolating anyone who'd had contact with victims.  the policy worked and by mid-march the number of new cases had fallen back to one or two a day. on 19 march the state of emergency was lifted, and at the beginning of april, schools re-opened.  but now, just 26 days after the state of emergency was lifted, a new one has had to be imposed.  hokkaido has acted independently of the central government, which placed tokyo, osaka and five other prefectures under a state of emergency last week. a nationwide state of emergency was declared on thursday.  almost a success story  in the last week, hokkaido has recorded 135 new confirmed cases of covid-19. unlike the first outbreak in february, there is no evidence the virus has been re-imported from outside japan.  none of the new cases are foreigners, nor have any of those infected travelled outside japan in the last month.  what does this tell us about how the virus outbreak was handled in hokkaido?  firstly, if you get on top of it really early, you can get it under control.  ""it is relatively easy to tackle clusters, to contact trace and isolate,"" says professor kenji shibuya of king's college london.  ""the authorities were quite successful in their cluster control approach. japan was in the very early phase of the outbreak back then. it was localised and it was a success story.""     hokkaido's containment measures seemed to be working at first  in this respect, hokkaido has some similarity to what happened in the south korean city of daegu. there, a large outbreak in a religious cult was aggressively traced. those infected were isolated and the outbreak was suppressed.  but the second lesson from hokkaido is much less reassuring.  after the daegu outbreak, the south korean government began a massive testing program to try and track the epidemic. japan has done the opposite.  even now, more than three months after japan recorded its first case, it is still only testing a tiny percentage of the population.  initially, the government said it was because large-scale testing was a ""waste of resources"". it's now had to change its tune a bit and says it will ramp up testing - but several reasons appear to have slowed it down.  firstly, japan's health ministry fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed by people who test positive - but only have minor symptoms. and on a wider scale, the testing is the responsibility of local health centres and not on a national government level.  some of these local centres are simply not equipped with the staff or the equipment to deal with testing on a major scale. local hotlines have been overwhelmed and even getting a referral from a doctor is a struggle.  the combination of these reasons mean authorities in japan don't have a clear idea of how the virus is moving through the population, says prof shibuya.  ""we are in the middle of an explosive phase of the outbreak,"" he said.  ""the major lesson to take from hokkaido is that even if you are successful in the containment the first time around, it's difficult to isolate and maintain the containment for a long period. unless you expand the testing capacity, it's difficult to identify community transmission and hospital transmission.""  the long road ahead  the third lesson is that this ""new reality"" is going to go on a lot longer than most people expect.  hokkaido has now had to re-impose the restrictions, though japan's version of a covid-19 ""lockdown"" is a rather softer than those imposed elsewhere.  most people are still going to work. schools may be closed, but shops and even bars remain open.  prof shibuya thinks without tougher measures japan has little hope of controlling this so called ""second wave"" of infections now taking place, not just in hokkaido, but across the country.  ""the key lesson"" he says ""is even if you are successful in containment locally but there is transmission going on in other parts of the country, as long as people are moving around, it's difficult to maintain a virus-free status"".  even so, the economy in hokkaido is already hurting badly. the island is hugely dependent on tourism, and japan has banned travel from the us and europe and most countries in asia.  a friend who owns a bar in the city of chitose has been forced to shut it down and lay off his staff. further north in the city of asahikawa, naoki tamura told us his bar is still open but there are now almost no customers.  ""one or two come by each night,"" he says.  ""there used to be many tourists from china and south east asia. they are completely gone. we don't hear any foreign language spoken on the street now. smaller lodging places are having to shut down. tourism businesses are really struggling.""  the new state of emergency is officially due to finish on 6 may, the end of japan's ""golden week"" holiday.     hokkaido's snowy slopes are highly dependent on tourists  but one local government official working on epidemic suppression in hokkaido told us they may now have to keep measures in place for much longer.

health,"science photo library  scientists are trying to work out why coronavirus can affect people in such different ways  a vast store of dna is being used to study why the severity of symptoms for coronavirus varies so much.  uk biobank - which contains samples from 500,000 volunteers, as well as detailed information about their health - is now adding covid-19 data.  it is hoped genetic differences could explain why some people with no underlying health conditions can develop severe illness.  more than 15,000 scientists from around the world have access to uk biobank.  prof rory collins, principal investigator of the project, said it would be “a goldmine for researchers”.  “we could go very quickly into getting some very, very important discoveries,” he said.  how do covid-19 symptoms differ?  some people with coronavirus have no symptoms - and scientists are trying to establish what proportion this is.  others have a mild to moderate disease.  but about one in five people has a much more severe illness and an estimated 0.5-1% die.  how can uk biobank help?  uk biobank has blood, urine and saliva samples from 500,000 volunteers whose health has been tracked over the past decade  and it has already helped to answer questions about how diseases such as cancer, stroke and dementia develop.  now, information about positive coronavirus tests, as well as hospital and gp data, will be added.  prof collins said: “we’re looking at the data in uk biobank to understand the differences between those individuals.  “what are the differences in their genetics? are there differences in the genes related to their immune response? are there differences in their underlying health?  “so it is a uniquely rich set of data - and i think we will transform our understanding of the disease.”     small genetic differences could explain why some people become very ill  for what will scientists be looking?  researchers will be scouring the entire genome, searching for tiny variations in dna.  one area of particular interest is the ace2 gene, which helps make a receptor that allows the virus to enter and infect cells in airways.  what about healthy people who become very ill?  in addition to the uk biobank study, a team led by prof jean-laurent casanova, from the rockefeller university, in new york, is planning to study people under 50 with no underlying medical conditions who are taken into intensive care units.  he told bbc news: “we are recruiting these patients worldwide, almost in every country.  “we have sequencing hubs distributed all over the world.  ""they collect samples, they sequence the genomes of these patients,and then together we analyse them.”  past research has shown some diseases, including flu and herpes, can make people with genetic variations - or inborn errors of immunity, as prof casanova calls them - especially ill.  “there are surprising inborn errors of immunity that render human beings specifically vulnerable to one microbe,"" he said.  “and this inborn error of immunity can be silent, latent, for decades, until infection by that particular microbe.  “what our programme does is to essentially test whether this idea also applies to covid.”     scientists from all over the world are hoping to understand more from patients' sequenced genomes  who else is looking at coronavirus genetics?  prof andrea ganna, from the university of helsinki, in finland, is leading a major effort to pull together genetic information on coronavirus patients from around the world.  “there are long-standing studies, involving hundreds of thousands of people, and other smaller ones collecting data on patients who test positive,"" he said.  ""it’s such a huge diversity and there are a lot of countries involved and we will try to centralise it.”  in iceland, for example, decode genetics has sequenced the genomes of about half the population.  it is now carrying out mass testing for coronavirus.  and every time someone tests positive, it then sequences the dna of the virus to see how it changes as it spreads.  chief executive dr kari stefansson said: “there is the possibility that the diversity in people’s response to the virus is rooted in the sequence diversity of the virus itself - that we may have many strains of the virus in our community and some of them are more aggressive than others.  “the other possibility is that this may be rooted in genetic diversity in a patient. or it may be a combination of both.”  follow rebecca on twitter."
health,"researchers have begun trials of drugs which could prevent vulnerable groups developing severe coronavirus symptoms.  the oxford university team plans to test pre-existing drugs on patients once they show the first signs of the disease.  they will look to see if any can reduce the need for hospitalisation or speed up recovery.  the project is one of a tranche announced by the government.  in the first phase of the oxford trial, gps will test the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to see if it is effective. another drug being considered is the antibiotic, azithromycin.  other promising drugs will be put to an expert advisory panel led by the government's chief scientific advisor, sir patrick vallance for approval for inclusion in the trial.  according to the trial leader, prof christopher butler of oxford university, one of the main criteria for potential drugs is that they should be already be widely available so that they can be used by doctors straight away.  ""as soon as we find that any one of our drugs is making an important difference, we want it to be part of clinical practice as soon as we can introduce it, within weeks if possible,"" he said.  pregnancy study  prof butler aims to recruit up to 500 gp practices to his trial. they will recruit patients over 65, as well as those aged over 50 who have underlying health conditions such as diabetes asthma and heart disease. that increase the risk of developing serious symptoms.  they will be asked to make contact before symptoms become serious, when they have a persistent cough or fever.  the research is among 21 new projects funded by the uk research and innovation agency (ukri) as part of its emergency response to tackling the spread of the virus.  another project to receive funding is aimed at better understand of how covid-19 affects early pregnancy.  a team from imperial college plans to develop an international registry so clinicians can report complications including miscarriage, stillbirth and restricted fetal growth.  it may well turn out that covid-19 does not put pregnant women at added risk - but dr ed mullins, who is part of the imperial team, says that it is important to check because previous epidemics, such as sars and swine flu, have been found to have adverse effects.  ""this study will rapidly collect information on women in pregnancy and their babies affected by the virus from around the world.  ""through regular online updates and collaboration with other studies, we will improve our collective understanding of the infection in pregnancy and learn how we can lessen its impact.""  'the best of humanity'  dr jo jenkinson, who is coordinating the ukri initiative said she had been ""overwhelmed"" by the response from research teams, many of whom are now working long hours, seven days a week to do what they can to combat the impact of the pandemic.  ""it has been quite extraordinary. the way the community is responding to tackle this outbreak is demonstrating the best of humanity. it has been quite humbling"".  the other areas of research covered by ukri include:  the scaling up of a promising vaccine candidate developed by researchers at imperial college  a study on why children and teenagers seem to be less affected by covid-19 at oxford university  an investigation by researchers at university college london into the spread of the virus among different populations  research by public health england on how long the virus can survive in the air - and on different types of surfaces and the best way of decontaminating them.  follow pallab on twitter"
health,"personal protective equipment (ppe) like masks and gloves helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives.  the government says it's boosting stocks and domestic manufacturing amid nhs workers' concerns about supplies and being asked to consider reusing some equipment.  what is ppe and who should wear it?  anyone who comes into close contact with patients who may or do have coronavirus should wear some form of protection. that includes staff working in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in gp surgeries or hospitals.  the type of ppe required depends on the level of risk.  guidelines recommend that anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection.  clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection, including disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors.  for example, that would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing.  ambulance staff driving the ambulance do not need to wear any ppe, but the rest of the crew should wear the appropriate amount depending on the likely level of exposure and risk they face.  pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask.  how much kit has been sent out?  since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, over 1.48 billion items of ppe have been delivered to the health and social care system in england, the department of health and social care (dhsc) confirmed on 26 may.  according to the bbc's panorama programme aired at the end of april, more than half of one billion ppe items distributed at that time were surgical gloves and, in most cases, each individual glove is counted rather than pairs.  the dhsc's most recent breakdown of 1.2 million items of ppe delivered by 10 may included:  164 million masks  192 million aprons  2.3 million gowns  711 million gloves  the 1.2 billion figure also included body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent.  and, as of 21 april:  the welsh government said it had delivered 48 million pieces of ppe to the nhs and local authorities.  in northern ireland, the uk has sent five million items of ppe and 75 million pieces have been ordered by its health service.  in scotland, first minister nicola sturgeon said there were ""adequate stocks of the main ppe"", but acknowledged difficulties with delivering gowns. however, a survey by the royal college of nursing suggested half of all nurses working in high-risk environments had been asked to reuse ppe.  the uk government said it has delivered 11 million items to scotland.  is there enough ppe?  this is the vital question, but one that is difficult to answer.  health secretary matt hancock has said the amount needed each month is ""absolutely vast"" and in the ""billions of items"" ballpark.  there are around 1.6 million nhs staff across the uk in hospitals and the community who need varying amounts of ppe depending on the type of work they do.  ppe ordering is done on a uk-wide level, but different parts of the nhs has different levels of stock.  there have been some shortages, including the supply of gowns.  global demand for ppe is at unprecedented levels and several countries have placed export bans on it.  northern ireland secretary brandon lewis told bbc breakfast the government was ""working through"" a list of about 10,000 uk-based firms which have offered to make ppe. it had also received 250,000 gowns from northern ireland.  nhs and social care workers can also call a hotline to request ppe.  health secretary matt hancock said the uk can now begin to replenish its ppe stockpiles after brokering new deals and increasing uk manufacture.  this includes a deal for:  70m masks with a company called honeywell  fabric for making gowns via don and low  14,000 visors a week made by jaguar land rover  can ppe items be washed and reused?  some bits of kit can only be used once per patient, while others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients.  all ppe worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated.  aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session.  however, when there are shortages, guidelines now say nhs staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer.  the health and safety executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit, and that these ""exceptional circumstances"" do not reflect its standard approach.  for example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused, it says.  it is easy to see how a member of staff would need to use lots of ppe when following the guidelines.  nhs providers, whose members include health trusts, has thanked the fire and police services, vets, local councils, diy stores and builders' merchants which have donated stocks of gowns and alternatives such as coveralls.  on 19 april, its chief executive, chris hopson, said: ""no-one in the nhs wanted to be where we now are on gowns, with a significant number of trusts reporting critically low stocks.""  what do nhs staff say?  the british medical association, which represents doctors in the uk, criticised the advice that some single-use ppe could be reused.  ""if it's being proposed that staff reuse equipment, this must be demonstrably driven by science and the best evidence - rather than availability - and it absolutely cannot compromise the protection of healthcare workers,"" said dr rob harwood, chair of its consultants committee.  a bma survey published on 18 april found that half of doctors working in high-risk areas reported shortages of long-sleeved disposable gowns and goggles.  the royal college of nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if adequate ppe has not been provided.  uk anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before taking a decision about whether to provide care."
health,"the idea warmer weather might stop the coronavirus seems to have faded as the virus has spread around the globe. but could new research contain a glimmer of hope?  it's too early to know for sure whether the new coronavirus is seasonal. to really know that, we'd have to watch how cases change in one place across the year.  but we can look at its spread in different climates across the world for clues.  what's the evidence?  there is some evidence coronavirus cases have particularly clustered around cooler, drier regions.  one study indicated countries particularly affected by the virus - those where it was spreading undetected via community transmission - by 10 march had lower average temperatures than those with fewer cases.  another paper looked at 100 chinese cities with more than 40 cases of covid-19 and suggested the higher the temperature and humidity, the lower the rate of transmission.  and another, not yet peer-reviewed, study suggested that although cases of the new coronavirus could be found all over the world, outbreaks had particularly clustered in ""relatively cool and dry areas"" - at least until 23 march.  but, as a group of researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine pointed out, the virus has now spread to every world health organization region, ""effectively spanning all climatic zones, from cold and dry to hot and humid regions"".  is there a north-south divide?  with lots of other viruses, including flu, a seasonal pattern is seen in the northern and southern hemispheres. but tropical regions close to the equator don't experience the same pattern.  and some of the hot and humid regions that have seen locally transmitted cases of the covid-19 virus, such as malaysia and the democratic republic of congo, are close to the equator and so might not provide the best evidence for what will happen elsewhere.     bondi beach in sydney, australia, where social distancing measures are in place  but looking to the southern hemisphere, australia and new zealand - at the tail-end of their summer season when their first cases were seen - have had far fewer cases than many of their northern-hemisphere counterparts.  there are lots of other factors at play, such as global footfall and the density of the population.  and since the virus has gradually spread around the world - initially through global travel - at the same time as seasons have been changing, it's difficult to pinpoint the effect of climate specifically.  are other coronaviruses seasonal?  there is some evidence other coronaviruses mainly circulate in the winter months, according to a team of researchers from university college london (ucl) and the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine.  the researchers asked almost 2,000 people for a weekly report on whether anyone in their household had symptoms of respiratory illness. and anyone with symptoms was asked to send in a swab for testing for a range of viruses.  from this, the researchers observed large peaks in coronavirus cases in the winter, around the same time as flu season. there were a small number of cases in the summer.  one of the study's authors, ellen fragaszy, at ucl said it was therefore ""possible we will see a bit of a relief in cases over the summer"". but we could not be sure this is how the new coronavirus would behave.  and the large number of cases and their spread across the world suggested we shouldn't be too hopeful of a summer respite.  is this virus like other coronaviruses?  the new coronavirus, called sars-cov-2, which causes the covid-19 disease, appears to spread in basically the same way as other coronaviruses.  but what makes it distinct is the how ill it makes you and the number of deaths it causes.  dr michael head, at the university of southampton, said the development and impact of the novel coronavirus was ""clearly very different from the existing 'common cold' type coronaviruses"".  ""it remains to be seen as to whether covid-19 cases will decline in response to environmental changes such as temperature and humidity,"" he said.  follow rachel on twitter"

health,"science photo library  prime minister boris johnson is now being treated in the intensive care unit (icu) at st thomas' hospital in london.  downing street says it is a precaution, on the recommendation of his doctors, should he need more complex care.  what is intensive care?  icus are specialist wards set up to provide treatment and close monitoring for patients who are too seriously ill to be cared for in other parts of the hospital.  they have fewer patients and more staffing to provide one-on-one care when its needed.  and they are kitted out with sophisticated monitoring equipment.  there are 500 intensive care beds at the newly-opened nhs nightingale hospital.  who needs intensive care?  there are many different reasons why a person might need this type of care.  some patients need it for recovery after intense surgery. others need it after severe trauma, following a road traffic accident, for example.  the pm has been moved there as a precaution because his symptoms of coronavirus infection have not improved.  he was admitted to st thomas' on sunday with a persistent symptoms, including a fever.  coronavirus can attack the lungs and it appears that the pm is now having difficulties with his breathing, although he is not yet on a ventilator machine for this.  what care is given?  not every patient in icu with coronavirus will need a ventilator to take over the job of breathing.  some may be put on a breathing support machine called cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) that uses mild pressure to push oxygen into the airways via a mask. patients can be awake and not sedated for this, unlike those who need a ventilator.  patients on icu will be connected to lots of different machines, via tubes, wires and cables, to monitor how their body is coping.  and they can be given intravenous drugs and other supportive treatments, including nutrition.  st thomas' has experience in treating coronavirus patients in its icu. for extremely serious cases it can use a life support machine called ecmo (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) which replaces some of the function of the heart and lungs. there are only a handful of these machines around the country.  recovering from intensive care  as soon as someone is well enough, they will be moved back out of intensive care to another hospital ward. this frees up the bed for another patient who urgently needs it.  some patients can leave after a few days, but others may need to be there for weeks or months.  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?"
health,"shortages are dogging the fight against the coronavirus. at bradford royal infirmary (bri) it's still only possible to test six staff for the virus per day, consultants have been making their own personal protective equipment, and - as bri's dr john wright reports - there's an urgent need to save oxygen.  6 april 2020  we are about a week away from the estimated peak of the epidemic. our mainstay of treatment is to simply keep patients breathing, and two issues are preoccupying us - ventilators and oxygen.  it's become clear that the uk is pretty low down the international ventilator league table. although we put in hasty orders for more, there appears to be a bit of a run on them, and we're worried that our order won't arrive in time to meet the covid-19 peak.  however, there is growing evidence that a simple machine used by patients with sleep apnoea (snoring and interrupted breathing) in their own bedrooms can be an effective alternative. and dr tom lawton, one of our ingenious intensive care consultants, has managed to get his hands on 100 of them from a local manufacturer.  oxygen is the other priority.  the manufacturers are working around the clock to keep up with demand, but hospitals just aren't built to provide the flow of oxygen needed to keep so many patients on ventilators - and we're finding that our infectious ""red zone"" wards can only take a maximum of 10 ventilated patients before the oxygen flow drops, triggering an alarm.  front line diary   john wright  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research. he has looked after patients in epidemics all over the world, including cholera, hiv and ebola outbreaks in sub-saharan africa. over the next few weeks he will be reporting for the bbc on how his hospital, the bradford royal infirmary, is coping with covid-19.  read his first two diary entries: why are people stealing hospital supplies? and making life-and-death decisions  when we ordered extra equipment to deal with coronavirus cases, we were expecting the surge to come in may, but covid-19 has turned out to be more transmissible than predicted and the peak is coming much sooner. so the extra ventilators aren't going to be here in time.  the form of non-invasive ventilation that appears to work best with covid-19 patients is called continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) but some of the hospital's cpap machines use 50 litres of oxygen per minute for a single patient. this has never been a problem before, because oxygen is not usually in short supply. but in italy it became a problem, because of the number of patients needing ventilation.     the army has been drafted in to deliver oxygen to hospitals  ""one of the issues is that while beds have oxygen next to them, we've never needed such a large flow of oxygen on the ward,"" says tom lawton. ""we have something like 250 litres per minute available for each ward, and about 3,000 available for the hospital - which again, has never been an issue before. but if you're using 50 litres per minute for each patient, then that's suddenly only five on a ward and 60 in a hospital - and we need more than that.  ""it's not just us, it's also hospitals around the country - they weren't designed for this level of oxygen use.""  watford general hospital declared a critical incident on saturday as it neared the point when it would have been unable to provide oxygen to patients who needed it.  listen to john wright  john wright is recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's nhs on the front line  you can hear the next episode at 11:00 on tuesday 7 april, catch up with the first two episodes online, or download the podcast  searching for ways round the problem, tom has been working with leeds university on a 3d-printed valve that could be attached to the hospital's ventilators to reduce the amount of oxygen they use.  but he also began looking at cpap machines used to treat sleep apnoea at home. these maintain air at a continuous pressure, inside a mask, to keep the user's airways open - they have to be repurposed to provide oxygen for use in the hospital, but they use much less of it than standard hospital ventilators.  tom called a local company to check availability.   tom lawton  tom lawton testing a continuous positive air pressure device usually used for sleep apnoea  ""they said, 'yes we've got 2,000, how many do you want?''' he says. ""and so our plan is to start with 100 and to see whether, if we use these early enough during a patient's stay, we can prevent people deteriorating and needing to go on to the more complex ventilators, and needing to come to the intensive care unit.""  we've been testing them over the weekend, and there's evidence from china and from the us that they seem effective. they just help inflate your lungs and that seems to be beneficial.  they are also very simple, which means that there's no need for a huge amount of training.   john wright  the first delivery of the simple cpap machines  debbie horner, the consultant in charge of covid-19 intensive care planning - who is now back at work after contracting the virus herself - says hospital doctors around the country took a sharp intake of breath when they heard that italy was running out of oxygen.  ""one of the issues that originally we didn't realise we were going to have is actually the diameter of the pipes coming into the hospital,"" she says. ""so it's not just the total amount of oxygen that the hospital has, it's also how much can you get to the bedside? or how many bedsides can you get oxygen to at any one time?""  we've had to consider how to distribute patients around the hospital ""based on the size of the pipes"", she says.  what everyone wants to avoid, through this kind of planning, is the situation that arose in italy, where hospitals were unable to provide intensive care for all patients because of shortages of kit or staff.   tom lawton  3d-printed venturi valves developed in italy (left) and in leeds (right) - the design will be posted on the internet  but a lot of thought is going into how we will deal with that situation if it arises.  ""one of the things that we want to do in this hospital is to make sure that if we do reach that point, any individual clinician has support not only from other clinicians on the shop floor, but also from another group of senior doctors and clinicians within the hospital,"" debbie horner says.  ""beyond that, there's also discussion about regional and national ethics committees, to support the individual hospitals with that decision-making process, so that everybody is making those decisions using the same framework.""  this is uncharted territory for us. there is a sense of dread about potentially having to replicate some of the decisions that have been taken in italy.  hopefully it won't reach that point.  follow @docjohnwright on twitter"
health,"moral injury is associated with veterans - but medical workers and frontline responders are at risk too  it is widely known that veterans can return from war with post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). far less appreciated is moral injury - a trauma wrapped up in guilt that we are now learning more about thanks to us-based research, writes james jeffrey.  moral injury most often occurs when a person commits, fails to prevent or witnesses an act that is anathema to their moral beliefs.  the department of veterans affairs website likens it to psychological trauma involving ""extreme and unprecedented life experience"", that can lead to ""haunting states of inner conflict and turmoil"".  us-based research into moral injury is now illuminating how such injuries can impact people in all walks of life, but especially first responders and healthcare workers facing the covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.  amid reports of new york city's emergency services getting overwhelmed and states struggling to provide enough ventilators, first responders and healthcare workers potentially face having to decide who gets a ventilator and who gets saved - something one nurse has described as ""her biggest fear"".  already thousands are dying in their care - and medical workers say they are facing scenarios they had never anticipated.  one doctor told the bbc the stress was intense. ""seeing people die is not the issue. we're trained to deal with death… the issue is giving up on people we wouldn't normally give up on.""  arthur markman, a professor in the department of psychology at the university of texas at austin, says: ""few people in healthcare have had real-life experience with triage in which a significant number of life-and-death decisions had to be made because of equipment shortages. that increases the chances that they may experience moral injury as a result of their jobs.""  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption coronavirus: lack of medical supplies 'a national shame'  the risk is compounded, he says, by workers at the front-lines of the epidemic - in places like new york, italy and spain - working long shifts with little break and sleep before they get back on the job. this leaves little if any time to process an incident that, if left unattended, may prove a moral injury in the making.  ""a person doesn't just take the gloves off afterwards without that loss affecting their moral fibre, their soul,"" says nöel lipana, who was left with a moral injury from his 2008 afghanistan tour. he now works as a social worker while promoting better understanding of moral injuries both in the military and beyond, which includes staging art performances and a forthcoming documentary film, quiet summons.  ""they came into this profession to help people, so what do you do when there is that sense of helplessness: you are a great physician, a great surgeon, you have some of the best medical equipment in the world, but you still can't save someone.""  mr lipana notes how veterans are often the focal point of a trauma discussion that needs be much wider. veterans affairs treats about 500,000 veterans a year with ptsd symptoms while the national institute of mental health estimates about 7.9 million civilians suffer from some form of ptsd.  ""the range of human experiences that are potentially damaging, socially, psychologically, biologically and spiritually because they cause a crisis of conscience are in no way limited to the military serving in warzones,"" says brett litz from the massachusetts veterans epidemiological research and information center, who is also a professor of psychological and brain sciences at boston university.  a recent paper co-authored by moral injury experts rita brock and hc palmer states that ""the fight against the coronavirus is strikingly similar to battlefield medicine: desperate and unrelenting encounters with patients, an environment of high personal risk, an unseen lethal enemy, extreme physical and mental fatigue, inadequate resources and unending accumulations of the dead.""  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption critical care nurse dawn was driven to despair by the actions of panic-buyers  mr lipana deployed to afghanistan as an air force major acting as his unit's counter improvised explosive device (ied) officer. he oversaw and trained us troops in how to detect and disable ieds planted by insurgents. two army soldiers he worked alongside died in separate explosions during his deployment.  ""they were killed by the thing i was meant to protect them from,"" says mr lipana, who was also involved in an operation during which four afghan children were killed in a blast. ""you play over what you could have done, should have done differently.""  guilt has been identified as the crucial factor that distinguishes a moral injury, even as other symptoms - anxiety and despair, flashbacks, social isolation and suicidal thoughts - overlap with ptsd.  ""traditional trauma treatment is about what's going on between your ears - it says you are just thinking about the incident wrong,"" mr lipana says. ""that has zero to do with the connection i have with my battle buddies, those kids, with our fundamental spiritual soul connection in this universe.""  the breach of a person's personal ethical code at the heart of a moral injury can inflict lasting behavioural, emotional and psychological damage, distorting a person's self-identity and provoking reflexive distrust of others.  ""in the military, we have it better in a way, as we get this break between deployments,"" mr lipana says. ""firefighters and cops have to reset themselves every 12 hours and go back out on their next shift.""  research in america has identified how for many veterans the pride in once wearing their uniform collides with a feeling of futility about what their service achieved and a belief that military leaders failed or deceived them and their fallen comrades. the resulting sense of violation from this can further fuel a lingering crisis of the conscience and spirit - deepening the moral injury.  while healthcare workers know they are doing the right thing by helping people with covid-19, they may still be affected by responses of leaders, from the hospital hierarchy up to the national level.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption us death rates v uk, italy and south korea  ""one of the most toxic forms of moral injury is betrayal,"" says ms brock, who is also co-author of soul repair: recovering from moral injury after war, and the director of the shay moral injury center. ""our healthcare workers are working to save people, but they have been betrayed by the government's inadequate response.""  healthcare workers' self-knowledge that they are involved in an entirely virtuous endeavour - as opposed to how veterans view the wars in iraq and afghanistan - can ""actually make it even worse,"" ms brock says.  ""you know you are on a life-saving mission, and so you can't understand how the president doesn't seem to get it in the same way.""  an estimated 11-20% of the 2.7 million men and women who deployed to iraq and afghanistan have received a diagnosis of ptsd linked to their service. the percentage of former service members coping with moral injury appears comparable, though experts warn that the prevailing emphasis on ptsd means moral injury can often go unrecognised and ignored.   submitted photo  nöel lipana (right) beside a british army officer in afghanistan  between 2005 and 2017, 78,875 veterans took their own lives, according to the most recent data from veterans affairs. currently, about 17 veterans are estimated to kill themselves each day.  the period following the acute phase of the coronavirus epidemic will likely be hardest for medical professionals in terms of psychological impact.  ""once the rest of society has said thank you and moved on to getting back to normal and thinking about the economy, that's when these people will sit down and think, 'what the hell happened back there?'"" ms brock says.  her paper with hc palmer states that some medical personnel may take their lives because of moral injury, having been ""crushed by decisions they had to make, swamped by unrelenting grief, consumed by fury and humiliation at the authorities who failed them"".  ms brock explains that, as in the military, often these emotions and reflections don't sink in for months due to the initial response's all-consuming pace.  prof markman stresses that ""moral injuries are not inevitable"" - and that medical professions will need time to reflect, and support from their managers.  ""leaders of hospitals need to communicate with the people working for them that they are using their training to make the best possible decisions under horrible circumstances. everyone in the profession needs to recognise that they are trying to do the least harm possible in a situation in which it is impossible to provide the highest-quality care to every patient in need.""   submitted photo  nöel lipana now produces theatrical performances to help people understand more about moral injuries  meanwhile, experts say that individuals in society have an important role to play too.  ""the rest of us can offer compassion to those who must, because of safety, keep us separated from those we love who are dying,"" brock and palmer write.  ""essential, too, is support for the families of medical professionals who are our friends or neighbours. and every time we interact with a medical professional, we should thank them."""
health,"lucy watts  lucy watts mbe is 26 years old and preparing to die if she contracts coronavirus.  the disability advocate has a life-limiting condition which includes multiple organ failure and restrictive lung disease requiring 24-hour care.  as the british medical association (bma) releases guidance preparing doctors to make ""brutal"" decisions and prioritise treatment for those most likely to recover, lucy fears that if she contracts covid-19 she will not be saved.  ""my life is devalued on the basis of my disabilities and needs, rather than my life and the difference i have made to the world,"" she says.  this is an edited version of a blog lucy wrote over several days, trying to make sense of her personal situation   lucy watts  lucy watts speaking at a tedx event with her support dog molly at her side  i know full well in this covid-19 pandemic that my life is not one that will be saved.  this is part-writing therapy, part-rant. it's full of anger and hurt and fear. it's trying to make peace, it's wanting to fight back.  and it's true, every last word.  i will be isolating for a minimum of 12 weeks, possibly longer. i have 24-hour care needs, and am usually cared for by intensive care nurses for 16 hours per day, but my nurses could be recalled to the nhs at any time. my mum can manage the nursing role, but she can't do my care 24/7.  we are practising strict infection control. i have made the difficult step to say that if i get covid-19, i will not be going to hospital.  i will be considered too frail, too unlikely to survive and too difficult to be weaned off ventilation on the other side - i have respiratory muscle weakness and therefore i'm unlikely to return to a meaningful quality of life - and that's only if i survived.  this situation is about who has the greatest chance of survival.  i have had to accept this over the last few days. it doesn't sit comfortably with me. i rage and cry that my life is devalued on the basis of my disabilities and needs, rather than my life and the difference i have made to the world.   lucy watts  i'm the 9th most influential disabled person in britain, i have an mbe for services to young people with disabilities and in 2019 i became a fellow of the royal society of arts for my commitment to disability rights.  i have more than proved my worthiness of being alive, but it counts for nothing in this pandemic.  i've changed hearts and minds through work, passion, determination, skills and experience.  but my life will not be deemed worth saving where cut-throat (metaphorically) decisions have to be made due to limited resources and the large numbers infected with covid - we're struggling now, and we're not yet near the peak.  whilst the decision not to go to hospital is mine, the decision about treatment is not within my control.  i have to accept my life is not a priority and will not be saved.  but as much as it makes me livid and distraught, i am a level-headed person who knows this is about saving those who have the highest chance of survival.  my body is on its last legs.   lucy watts  i have so much going on - a nameless syndrome that stops cells making enough energy for my organs and muscles to work. i have multiple organ failure, restrictive lung disease and respiratory muscle weakness, a bowel that is always in and out of obstruction, chronic pancreatitis that keeps flaring up, an immune system that doesn't fight infection well and a new issue causing joint pain and fever 80% of the time.  and yet i have managed to survive sepsis 14 times - is that not a great track record?  doesn't that show, despite how weak and fragile my body is, i've got a 100% success rate in surviving life-threatening events?  but do i have a high enough chance of surviving this virus - potentially at the expense of someone else's life?  it's a funny head space to be in, feeling like i want to live at all costs, but knowing efforts to prolong my life could cost someone else's.  i've gone through the stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression - but the ""end"" of this cycle for me does not end in ""acceptance"". i do not accept this. i do not accept that my life is less worthy to be saved.  does it end in understanding? yes, to an extent, i understand.  i cannot accept i'm not worth saving, but i understand why it has to be this way.  i understand it's not personally levied against me. it's a pandemic in which we have so few resources.  i just want to live. i have so much to do, so many plans, so many ideas.  my life matters, my life is worthy, my life is valuable. but we're in a crisis of innumerable proportions, and people on the frontline have to make heart-breaking decisions. decisions that aren't fair in any way, but still have to be made.  i say thank you to the nhs, for all everyone is doing. i may make it out the other side of this pandemic; i may not. one thing i can say, however, is that the nhs has kept me alive against the odds for years. it gave me the ability to live an amazing life and to achieve great things and make a difference in the world.  my life matters now and it matters after this. i've created a legacy to be proud of.  although lucy is only presuming she will not be treated in hospital and thankfully does not have covid-19, the bma's ethical guidance does prepare doctors that they will face ""agonising choices"" over who gets potentially life-saving treatments, including ventilation.  it says: ""it is legal and ethical to prioritise treatment among patients,"" and urges doctors to consider: ""severity of acute illness; presence and severity of co-morbidity; frailty or, where clinically relevant, age.""  the bma says managers and senior doctors will set ""thresholds"" for admission to intensive care units - patients whose ""probability"" of dying, or requiring prolonged intensive support, exceeds the set threshold would not be considered for intensive treatment.  julian sheather, an ethical advisor for the bma, said: ""in our present circumstances, the question will no longer be how best to meet individual need, but how to maximise benefits.  ""it is preferable to save the lives of three patients with high need and a high likelihood of benefiting than one patient with high need and a low - but nonetheless real - chance of benefiting.  ""this is the heart of the moral challenge.""  edited by beth rose  for more disability news, follow bbc ouch on twitter and facebook, and subscribe to the new cabin fever podcast on bbc sounds.  if you're after more frank disability and mental health chat to get you through the days of covid-19 sign up to bbc ouch.  the team have produced two news podcasts - cabin fever, discussing a whole lot of corona-related topics and the isolation diary charting the highs and lows of one family who are shielding for at least 12 weeks."
health,"we have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work.  on 10 may, boris johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes.""  so what can be lifted and when?  why can't we just lift lockdown?  this virus remains massively contagious. before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called r-number).  and less than 5% of the uk population is estimated to have been infected. or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable.  if we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable.  is there any wiggle room?  the goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the r-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). that has been achieved.  however, it is only just below one.  ""there isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"".  one set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases.  what will 'test, track, trace' achieve?  the aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine.  this strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts.  the more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life.  ""at the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said dr kucharski.  ""if we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with.""  but even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check.  ""it is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said dr kucharski.  what about protecting those at risk?  another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"".  instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely for the most vulnerable.  prof mark woolhouse, from the university of edinburgh, said: ""very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society.  ""if we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently.""  that would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it.  the danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure.     millions of people in the uk will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus.  which lockdown measures could be lifted?  some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus.  ""essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" dr adam kucharski, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, told the bbc.  dr kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus.  low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries.  wales has already announced that from 11 may, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day.  moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household.  substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households.  ""i think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says.  there remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together.  and there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily.  when could restrictions be lifted?  there is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak.  we could drive levels down as low as possible. that will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. the trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer.  or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems.  what could shift the balance?  the biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. that is thought to be more than a year away.  failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks.  effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care.  we might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. but we are all still in this for the long haul.  download the bbc news app for all the latest headlines.  follow james on twitter."
health,"more than 4,300 people have died in the uk after testing positive for coronavirus. among them are frontline medical staff. sirin kale tells the story of two of them.  the two men did not know each other, probably their paths never crossed, but in death they would find a strange symmetry. dr amged el-hawrani and dr adil el tayar - two british-sudanese doctors - became the first working medics to die of coronavirus in the uk.  their families don't want them to be remembered in this way - but rather as family men, who loved medicine, helping their community, and their heritage.  like the many men and women who come from overseas to join the nhs, el-hawrani, 55, and el tayar, 64, left behind friends and relatives back home to dedicate their careers to the uk's health service. they married and had children - el-hawrani settling in burton-upon-trent; el tayar in isleworth, london. and they became pillars of their communities, while maintaining ties to the country of their birth, the sudan that both men loved.  their stories are illustrative of the many foreign-born medics who even now are battling covid-19.   el tayar family  adil el tayar was born in atbara in northeast sudan in 1956, the second of 12 children. his father was a clerk in a government office; his mother had her hands full raising her brood. atbara was a railway town, built by the british to serve the line between port sudan on the red sea coast, and wadi halfa in the north. it is a close-knit community, where the first sudanese labour movement started, in 1948. everyone knows everyone.  ""he came from humble beginnings,"" says adil's cousin, dr hisham el khidir. ""whatever came into that household had to be divided amongst 12 kids. it's the reason he was so disciplined when he grew up.""   el tayar family  in sudan in the 1950s and 1960s, bright young men became doctors or engineers - respected professions that would give their entire family a better life. and when you're one of 12 children - well, that's a lot of people to help look after. adil knew this, which is why he was a diligent student, even from a young age. but he didn't mind, in sudanese culture, looking after your family isn't seen as a burden. it's just what you do.  ""he was always so serious, so focused,"" hisham remembers. ""he wanted to do medicine early on, because it was a good career in a third-world country."" he had a calm, caring disposition. ""never in the years i knew him, did i ever hear him raise his voice."" hisham looked up to adil, who was eight years older than him, and later followed in his footsteps to become a doctor.  the el-hawrani family lived almost 350km (217 miles) away, down the single-track railroad that links atbara to the capital khartoum. it was there that amged was born in 1964, the second of six boys. his father salah was a doctor, and in 1975 the family moved to taunton, somerset, before settling in bristol four years later.   el-hawrani family  amged el-hawrani (left) as a child - with father salah and older brother ashraf  ""dad was one of the first waves of people coming over from sudan in the 1970s,"" remembers amged's younger brother, amal. ""we didn't know any other sudanese families growing up in the uk. it was just us and english people. it felt like an adventure. everything was new and different.""  only a year apart in age, amged and his older brother ashraf were inseparable. ""they both could have done anything,"" says amal. ""they were intelligent, they were all-rounders. they loved football and technology. they embraced everything - just drank it all in.""  amged loved gadgets. ""he'd always turn up with this bit of kit he'd just bought,"" amal laughs, ""saying, 'look, i've just bought this projector that can fit in your pocket, let's watch a film!'""   el-hawrani family  amged el-hawrani's graduation photo from the royal college of surgeons in 1993  amged and ashraf both studied medicine, like their father. and then in 1992, tragedy struck - ashraf died of an asthma attack, aged 29. it was amged who discovered his body.  ""it had a huge emotional impact on him,"" amal says. ""but he became the rock of the family."" he even named his son ashraf, after his brother.  over the coming decades, adil and amged forged careers in the nhs. adil become an organ transplant specialist, while amged specialised in ear, nose, and throat surgery.  the life of an nhs doctor isn't easy - it is high-stakes work, which often takes you away from your family.   el tayar family  adil el tayar with colleagues  but adil's children always felt that he had time for them. ""no matter how tired he was, he would always get home from work and make sure he spent time with each of us,"" says his daughter ula, 21. ""he cared about family life so much.""   el tayar family  adil el tayar with members of his family  adil loved to potter about in his garden, tending to his apple and pear trees, and planting flowers all around. ""it was his happy place,"" says ula. he also loved to collect new friends. ""he'd have barbecues in summer, and there would often be some random person there you'd never met before,"" adil's son osman, 30, jokes. ""you'd wonder where he'd picked them up from.""  amged was intellectually curious, and a great conversationalist. ""he was one of those people who had an encyclopedic knowledge of everything,"" says his brother amal. he was also a formula one fan - ayrton senna was his legend. ""amged was generous, and without guile,"" remembers his friend dr simba oliver matondo. they met when they took the same class at university, and spent their student years eating pizza hut food - a big treat back then - and watching kung fu films.  the national health is staffed by many foreign-born workers - 13.1% of nhs staff say their nationality is not british, and one-in-five come from minority backgrounds.  as of 3 april, four british doctors, and two nurses, have died after testing positive for covid-19. five were from bame [black, asian and minority ethnic] communities. in addition to adil and amged, there is dr alfa sa'adu, born in nigeria, dr habib zaidi, born in pakistan, and nurse areema nasreen, who had pakistani heritage. ""we mourn the passing of our colleagues in the fight against covid-19,"" says dr salman waqar of the british islamic medical association. ""they enriched our country. without them, we would not have an nhs.""  'nhs crown'  nurse aimee o'rourke, 39, died after a covid-19 diagnosis on thursday 2 april.  on facebook, her daughter megan murphy wrote: ""you are an angel and you will wear your nhs crown forever more because you earned that crown the very first day you started.""  o'rourke was treated at the queen elizabeth the queen mother hospital in margate, kent, where she worked.  both adil and amged considered themselves british. ""amged was in this country for 40 years,"" says amal. ""he was as british as tea and crumpets."" but they kept close ties with their native sudan. ""when someone emigrates to the uk, they don't just cut all their ties with their country,"" adil's cousin hisham explains. ""they make a better life for themselves, but they maintain their roots.""  adil returned to khartoum in 2010, to set up an organ transplant unit. ""he wanted to give something back to the less fortunate in sudan,"" his son osman explains. since adil's death, his family has received dozens of phone calls from people in sudan, telling them about their father's charity work. they knew their dad spent a lot of time helping people back home in sudan - they'd overhear his phone calls.  but none of adil's children realised just how many people he'd helped, until after he died.   el-hawrani family  amged el-hawrani (right) with a colleague  amged was also charitable, climbing in the himalayas in 2010 to raise money for a ct scanner for queen's hospital burton, where he worked. like adil, he was connected to his heritage. ""he'd always reminisce about growing up in sudan,"" says his brother amal. ""he was very proud to be sudanese.""  his friend matondo was a frequent visitor at amged's mum's house in bristol, where they'd eat ""ful medames"", a traditional fava bean stew, and feta cheese with chillies. a supporter of al merrikh - the manchester united of sudan - amged arranged for the khartoum team's dilapidated pitch to be repainted, picking up the bill himself.  both doctors cared deeply about the nhs, an institution they had spent their lifetimes serving. ""adil really believed in this excellent system that provided free care at the point of delivery to everyone who needed it,"" says his cousin dr hisham el khidir.   el-tayar family  his passion rubbed off on his children - osman and his sister abeer, 26, both followed in adil's footsteps to become doctors. the day osman was accepted as a surgical registrar - a prestigious, competitive post - adil was emotional. ""he was so happy,"" osman remembers. ""he just kept saying, 'mashallah, mashallah.'""  when both doctors got sick, they didn't think much of it, their families say. amged was the first to fall ill. his mother had recently recovered from a nasty bout of pneumonia, and in late february, after finishing a long shift, he drove to bristol to see her. amged felt unwell in the car, but assumed he was probably just exhausted.  by 4 march, he was admitted to burton's queen's hospital. his colleagues put him on a ventilator. he was later transferred to glenfield hospital in leicester, where he was put on a more sophisticated ecmo machine, to breathe for him. amged would stay on that machine, fighting for his life, for nearly three weeks.  meanwhile, adil was working in the a&e department of hereford county hospital. on the 13 march, the first uk death from coronavirus was reported in scotland. the very next day, adil started feeling unwell. he came back to the family house in london, and self-isolated.  over the next few days, his condition deteriorated. on the 20 march, abeer didn't like how her dad looked - he was breathless, and couldn't string a sentence together - and she called an ambulance. doctors at west middlesex university hospital put adil on a ventilator. but even then, alarm bells weren't ringing. ""we thought, this is bad,"" says osman. ""but we had no idea it would be fatal.""  on 25 march, adil's family received a call from the hospital. things were very bad, and they should come now. they raced there to be with him. adil's children watched their father die through a glass window. they weren't allowed in the room, because of the risk of contagion.  ""that was the most difficult thing,"" says osman. ""having to watch him. i always knew that one day my father would die. but i thought i would be there, holding his hand. i never imagined i would be looking at him through a window, on a ventilator.""  adil spent decades serving the nhs. but his family feels that the nhs didn't do enough for him in return, by giving him the protective gear that might have prevented him contracting coronavirus. ""i think it's unbelievable in the uk in 2020 that we're battling a life-threatening disease, and our frontline staff are not being safely equipped with ppe to do their job,"" says osman. ""bottom line is that it's wrong and it needs to be addressed immediately.""  amid repeated claims of shortages in some parts of the nhs, the government has offered frequent bulletins on the volume of personal protective equipment being delivered. the health secretary matt hancock has said he will ""stop at nothing"" to protect frontline health workers - describing the situation as ""one of the biggest logistical challenges of peacetime"".  all the time adil had been in hospital, amged had clung onto life. but on the 28 march, doctors decided to take amged off the ecmo machine. dressed in protective gear, amged's brother akmal was allowed into his room, to hold his hand. amal watched from behind a window.  amged will be buried in bristol, beside his dad, and close enough for his mum to visit.   el-hawrani and el tayar families  at his own request, adil will be buried in sudan, besides his father and grandfather. getting the repatriation paperwork sorted is proving difficult, given the coronavirus lockdown. ""the last wishes of someone who died are very sacred in our culture,"" explains osman. ""we will make it happen.""  adil's children won't be able to attend the funeral - although cargo planes are flying, there are currently no passenger flights to sudan. but he won't be buried alone. the community of people adil grew up with - his siblings, and their children, and the people he supported over the years, will bury him instead. in sudanese tradition, every mourner digs their hand into the dust, and throws soil into the grave. ""there are hundreds of people waiting to bury him,"" says osman. ""i've been on the phone with them all. they're waiting for him to arrive.""  meanwhile, the garden adil loved so much is overgrown. ""it's a sad view,"" says ula. ""it's dishevelled now he's not around. he was always the one who kept it together."" but the apple tree will be coming into blossom soon.  top : el tayar family and university hospitals derby and burton. all images subject to copyright."
health,"pa media  official data suggests testing for coronavirus per head of population in england has been considerably slower so far than that in scotland, wales and northern ireland.  as of 8 april, 343 people have been tested per 100,000 of the uk population, according to the department of health and social care. these are diagnostic swab tests to establish whether an individual is infected by coronavirus.  across the four nations, the numbers break down as follows:  northern ireland: 503 people tested per 100,000 of population (total 9,564 people tested)  scotland: 471 people tested per 100,000 (total 26,226 people tested)  wales: 440 people tested per 100,000 (total 14,031 people tested)  england : 320 people tested per 100,000 (total 182,887 people tested)  that means that up to 8 april, 79% of the people tested in the uk were in england, despite england having roughly 84% of the country's population. england has also had 83% of confirmed coronavirus cases in the uk so far, and 91% of deaths recorded in hospitals.  testing and laboratories  health secretary matt hancock has already said the government has ""a huge amount of work to do"" to meet its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day in the uk by the end of april.  and the slower pace of testing in england has raised further concern because much of the procurement and allocation of tests has now been centralised for all four nations.  experts say england has far more laboratories than the other uk nations, and it is important to create a uniform testing platform so all labs are testing in exactly the same way.  but dr bharat pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the university of exeter medical school, says accreditation of labs has been too slow.  ""this is nothing to do with capacity,"" he says, ""capacity can be expanded very quickly, and there are plenty of labs.""  ""this is a simple test and we just need to get on with it. we don't need this stranglehold by public health england [phe].""  when asked to comment on the slower pace of testing in england so far, phe pointed out that it is not directly responsible for laboratory accreditation. that's the job of the united kingdom accreditation service, although it is up to phe and the department of health to ask for certain standards to be maintained.  ""phe has moved heaven and earth to develop an accurate test, ensuring that every hospital patient that needs one has been tested,"" said phe's chief executive duncan selbie in a statement.  ""we and our nhs colleagues have delivered our promise of 10,000 tests a day on time and are on track for 750,000 tests per month [25,000 per day] by the end of april,"" he said.  ""we have supported nhs laboratories to get their covid-19 testing up and running, to make sure the tests they are using provide accurate results.""  that of course does not explain the discrepancy in testing figures between different nations within the uk so far.     the pace of testing in england has been increasing over the past week, but a rapid acceleration may only happen when private laboratories join those run by public health bodies.  one new testing facility is being developed by the pharmaceutical companies astrazeneca and gsk with the university of cambridge.  ""we believe we will start testing by mid-april,"" astrazeneca's ceo pascal soriot told the bbc's today programme, ""and be at scale with 30,000 tests a day by early may.""  all four nations are also obviously trying to increase testing as much as possible in public health facilities as part of the uk-wide effort.  the scottish first minister nicola sturgeon said nhs scotland's testing capacity in hospitals would increase to at least 3,500 a day ""by the end of this month, at the latest"".  she said that figure should be compared to the ""pillar one"" target in england of 25,000 tests a day - done in nhs and public health laboratories - by the end of april.  this piece was published on 3 april and updated on 8 april to include the latest figures.  read more from reality check  send us your questions  follow us on twitter"
health,"the uk's newest, and largest, hospital facility has taken in its first coronavirus patients needing intensive care treatment.  east london's excel exhibition centre, which normally plays host to lifestyle shows, expos and conferences, has been converted into the temporary nhs nightingale hospital, with space for 4,000 beds.  in nine days, the 87,328 square metres of double exhibition halls have been fitted out with the framework for about 80 wards, each with 42 beds. some 500 fully-equipped beds, with oxygen and ventilators, are already in place and there is space for another 3,500.  if it did reach capacity, it would be one of the largest hospitals in the world.  each ward is named after a different british doctor, nurse or other medical professional.  the first two wards to open will be named lady harriett acland and ethel bedford-fenwick after two nurses whose work in the 18th and 19th centuries paved the way for modern nursing.  how was it built?  the facility, which was officially opened on 3 april, was built with the help of up to 200 soldiers a day from the royal anglian regiment and royal gurkha rifles, working long shifts alongside nhs staff and contractors.  timelapse video of nhs nightingale being built     architects and engineers from bdp, the firm that helped convert the centre, were part of the planning team given the task of creating the life-saving facility.  bdp principal james hepburn said the scale and timeframe for the construction were unlike previous healthcare projects and architects were coming up with designs almost as building needed to get under way.  the framework for individual bed bays were made from material usually used to make exhibition stands - because it is lightweight and could be constructed quickly.  mr hepburn said the three main challenges were:  speed of the construction and what to build it out of  having a reliable electrical supply - for life-saving ventilators and equipment  and being able to get medical gases to each of the beds  excel's existing electrical infrastructure has been modified to ensure the power supply can cope with demand - and not cut out. temporary generators and oxygen tanks, to supply the beds, have also been installed.  mr hepburn said his team has drawn up an instruction manual to share with other countries taking on similar emergency projects - and people in australia and canada have already contacted them.  where will the staff come from?  the excel centre's suitability for the hospital site goes beyond the functional characteristics of the building.  it is served by public transport links. the nearby london city airport can be used to bring in supplies and equipment and there is also hotel and university accommodation close by - should it be needed.  it will be led by a team of eight senior staff, drawn from local hospitals and trusts. at capacity, the hospital will need 16,000 staff to keep it running. that will include thousands of doctors, nurses and volunteers.  ""the numbers are scary,"" chief operating officer natalie forrest said. ""to run one ward, including all of our ancillary staff, we need 200 members of staff.""  the nursing staff is being drawn from other hospitals, as well as volunteers from st john ambulance. airline staff from easyjet and virgin atlantic have also been approached.  cabin crews have security clearance and many of them are also first aid-trained. the nhs says they would be changing beds, helping doctors and nurses on the wards, and performing other non-clinical tasks.     it is not a conventional walk-in hospital - only patients already on ventilators will be admitted, transferred from other intensive care units across london. they will stay at the hospital until their course of ventilation is finished.  support services such as pharmacies and therapy treatment are also be available.  and a mortuary is also included in the nhs nightingale design. additional mortuary space is also being found elsewhere in the city, including wanstead flats in the manor park area of newham, local residents have been told.  other temporary morgues are also being set up around the uk, including at an ice rink in milton keynes, a crematorium in ruislip, and at birmingham airport, where the hangar facility will initially have space for 1,500 bodies ""but will expand to hold more"".  where are the other nhs nightingales?  work is already underway to expand the nhs nightingale-style hospitals beyond london to ease pressures on regional nhs services.  conference centres in birmingham, manchester and harrogate have been transformed into nhs nightingale hospitals over the past few weeks to serve the midlands and north of england.     prince william opens the new nhs nightingale at the nec in birmingham  work is also underway in glasgow and at the university of west england (uwe) in bristol to create temporary emergency hospital sites.  scotland's emergency facility at the sec in glasgow will be named nhs louisa jordan, after a nurse who died from typhus while serving in serbia during an outbreak in 1915.     hundreds of bed bays are being constructed in the sec     manchester central convention centre has been converted into nhs nightingale hospital north west  belfast city hospital's tower block has been transformed into northern ireland's first nightingale hospital - a 230-bed unit staffed by a team drawn from across northern ireland.  an extra 6,000 beds are also being set up in wales - many in sports and leisure facilities - to take the pressure off hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.  among them is the principality stadium, in cardiff, the national stadium of wales, with capacity for up to 2,000 beds, if needed."
health,"john wright  dr dinesh saralaya at the entrance to the red zone  in his first diary for the bbc, published on monday 30 march, dr john wright of bradford royal infirmary reported on his hospital's preparations for the coronavirus storm. in the last few days, the storm has begun, putting all involved under great strain.  2 april 2020  not that long ago the hospital had just a few covid-positive patients, isolated inside rooms. by the start of this week we had two full wards designated as ""red"" or infectious zones. and two more turned red a day later.  one of the most overused phrases that we use as doctors is, ""it's just a virus."" it reassures our patients, and it covers up our own uncertainty. so for many the devastation that the coronavirus has wrought has been so unexpected.  by wednesday, 14 of our patients had died.  this is one of the big issues around covid-19 - its high death rate. so while less than one in a 100 of those who get it will die of it, when you get into hospital that goes up to one in five, or one in six patients.  we are used to people dying in hospital, because it's often a place where people die. but normally we are reflective in our practice, we give time, and time is a great instrument for us in health care. but in the hospital today we are making rapid decisions about life and death - decisions about ventilation, about escalation care and when to make the decision about end of-life-care.  as palliative care consultant dr clare rayment says, none of us wants to get it wrong.  front line diary   victor de jesus  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research. he has looked after patients in epidemics all over the world, including cholera, hiv and ebola outbreaks in sub-saharan africa. over the next few weeks he will be reporting for the bbc on how his hospital, the bradford royal infirmary, copes with covid-19.  read his first diary entry: why are people stealing hospital supplies?  ""there's a lot of worrying about making those rationing decisions because it's not something we are used to in the uk,"" she says.  ""i think in other countries it's something they might be more used to having conversations about. we are used to people dying in hospital but we aren't used to saying, 'you're going to die because i can't give you this ventilator because someone needs it more.'""  many of us have got parents, and we may worry that these decisions like these are going to be taken on the basis of the patient's age.  but age is only one factor.   john wright  hospital staff have been training for redeployment to intensive care wards  ""we should recognise this as a society, that so many 80-year-olds are actually in better physical and mental shape than some 65-year-olds. that 80-year-old shouldn't be written off,"" says dr alex brown, a consultant in elderly care.  another feature of covid-19 is that people are dying alone. hardly anyone is allowed into the hospital now to visit.  so the challenge is ""thinking about how best we can make sure those people have good deaths in an environment where their family members are likely not to be,"" clare rayment says.  find out more  john wright is recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's nhs on the front line  you can hear the next episode at 11:00 on tuesday 7 april, catch up with the first two episodes online, or download the podcast  technology is part of the answer.  ""if someone wants to be there when someone's dying, can we do that in a video call? it's out of everyone's comfort zone, but actually it might be very important for a patient, if they're awake enough, to be able to see their wife or whoever on the phone,"" she says. ""and also for that wife, husband, daughter, whoever it might be, to see that their loved one is comfortable, isn't distressed.""  emma barnes, the senior sister for the respiratory wards, tells me that even though family members cannot enter the hospital some are still driving in to be near their loved ones, and sitting in their cars in the car park.   john wright  senior sister emma barnes  she has also noticed the emotional strain that staff are under - people crying in a corner, or admitting that they cry when they get home and have to hide it from their children. she has raised the idea of designating a room as a ""wobble room"" where hospital staff can go for a moment if they are feeling emotionally wobbly.  i think there is a mass insomnia among the staff, because our normal routine has suddenly been totally disrupted. i've taken to waking up through the night thinking about it myself.  so many things have changed so quickly. it's barely two months since the first covid-19 patients were diagnosed in the uk. and yet the number of cases has now exceeded 30,000.  in the 16th century, measles and smallpox were spread by spanish conquistadors to entire communities who had no prior immunity. those viruses took 100 years to conquer the americas. covid-19 has taken 100 days to conquer the world.  follow @docjohnwright on twitter"

health,"jessie clark was hospitalised after she struggled with her breathing.  while the number of coronavirus deaths has risen above 2,000 in the uk, most people who contract the virus go on to get better.  some people experience relatively mild symptoms, or even no symptoms at all. others have no option but hospital treatment. we have spoken to three people who were hospitalised after developing covid-19.  all are at different stages of their lives, and are recovering in isolation.  'i was fighting for mine and my baby's life'   karen mannering with her husband before she contracted covid-19.  karen mannering from herne bay in kent is six months pregnant with her fourth child. the 39-year-old started struggling with a persistent cough and a fever during the second week of march, but hospital staff were wary of bringing her in. on day 11, that changed.  ""i called 999 and my breathing sounded so bad an ambulance was at our house within minutes,"" explains karen. ""i was literally gasping for air so they put me on oxygen straight away.""  karen tested positive for covid-19. she had pneumonia in both of her lungs and was isolated in a hospital room for a week.  ""no one was allowed to come and see me,"" she says. ""it was a very lonely, dark time. i was bed-bound for two or three days. i couldn't even go to the toilet. if they needed to change the bed sheets, they would have to turn me over.  ""when i struggled to breathe, i would buzz for help and would have to wait for staff to get their protective equipment on before they could attend to me. i was constantly on the phone to my family to keep me calm. i was scared i was going to die and my family say they had prepared for the worst.  ""i was fighting for every single breath. i was fighting for mine and my baby's life.""  karen says she will never forget the feeling of crisp, cold air on her face the day she left hospital.  ""my husband and i drove home with our face masks on and the windows open,"" she says. ""the breeze felt amazing. i suddenly appreciated the smallest of things.""  karen is now self-isolating at home, but in a room away from the rest of her family. she is getting stronger, but still has a dry cough which could last months.  she believes she could have contracted coronavirus at the beauty salon where she works, but she may never know for sure. she may also never know how her family seems to have escaped the virus.  ""i just wanted someone to help me""  jessie clark from sheffield knew she would be vulnerable if she contracted covid-19 - she has chronic kidney disease and five years ago had a kidney removed. when the 26-year-old started coughing and becoming increasingly breathless she started to worry. within days, she was struggling to walk.   jessie clark was hospitalised after she struggled with her breathing.  ""i also had a lot of pain in my ribs, back and abdomen,"" explains jessie. ""i felt like i had been beaten up.""  two days after prime minister boris johnson announced the uk was going into lockdown, jessie's fiance tom drove her to a&e. they were quickly separated because of safety restrictions.  ""i was scared to be alone, but i was so poorly i just wanted someone to help me,"" jessie says. ""i was given a green mask with a wired bit around the nose to keep it up. i was taken to a unit which seemed to be being used for covid-19 patients. social distancing was in place so we had bays separated by walls with a bed in each bay.  ""i wasn't tested for covid-19. my doctor told they 'couldn't swab everyone, but it was safe to assume i had it'. he said the pain i was experiencing was the inflammation from my lungs and that i should keep self-isolating and taking painkillers.  ""i have never had breathing issues before. it is scary not knowing if you are going to stop breathing or if what you are feeling is normal for the virus.""  jessie was in hospital for six hours. tom waited for his fiancé in the car park, unsure what was happening. he is a key worker and the couple think he may be asymptomatic and accidentally gave jessie the virus.  five days after leaving hospital, jessie still struggles to walk and sleeps up to 18 hours a day. she sometimes has coughing fits but can breathe more easily.  ""i think some young people think they're invincible, but most are taking coronavirus seriously now,"" she said. ""there has been a lot of information telling us this virus doesn't affect people my age, but it definitely does.""  ""i was within a whisper of a very dark place""   stewart boyle says he could feel the virus attack his lungs, making it difficult to breathe.  stewart boyle is almost certain he contracted coronavirus at one of his choir meetings a few weeks ago.  ""we were all social distancing when we met on the thursday, but by sunday a high number of people had come down with flu-like symptoms,"" he says.  over the following 10 days, the 64-year-old's health declined.  ""it's quite subtle at first,"" he explains. ""but then i would try to climb the stairs and be wheezing like an old man. soon i didn't have the ability to exercise or move at all. the virus was attacking my lungs and i was losing the capacity to fight back.""  stewart's family called 111 and he was taken to hospital.  ""it was like something out of a movie,"" he says. ""i was wheeled into the 'red zone' and there were loads of tests being carried out and swabs being taken. they thought i had coronavirus so they upped my oxygen. there were a couple of hours where i was within a whisper of a very dark place and i thought, 'maybe my time is up'. but i wanted to live.  ""i could feel the battle in my lungs and it required all my reserves to get through it. the extra oxygen gave my lungs a break and gave me the added energy to push out the disease. the nhs staff were incredible, but all they can do is help you fight the virus. there's no vaccination or magical potion that can save you. it's about your own resilience.""   stewart boyle in hospital.  on saturday, stewart left hospital and is now self-isolating at home. he has been drinking a lot of water to help his lungs and throat recover.  meanwhile, his choir has performed a special song for him via zoom.  ""the song was about looking after me and holding me. it was stunning,"" he says. ""i'm a long way off to getting my singing voice back. all i can do right now is croak."""

health,"jane williams  dr jane williams says ""it's very hard to stop being a doctor""  thousands of retired doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers have offered to return to the nhs during the coronavirus crisis. why are they going back and how can they make a difference?  for dr jane williams, a retired gp, evidence of the mounting pressure on the nhs came worryingly close to home. she was contacted by a friend who had become breathless and was worried they had coronavirus. she urged the friend to call the nhs 111 service. despite quickly getting through initially, they didn't get a call back for 24 hours.  “you realise what severe pressures the 111 service must be under,” dr williams says. “it’s very hard to stop being a doctor. i feel the sooner that i can be deployed to help, the better really.”  in the next few days, she hopes to start working from home doing telephone triage for 111, a role she feels that at the age of 64, she is safest doing.  dr williams kept her medical licence after retiring from the surrey gp surgery - where she had been a partner for 30 years - in october 2016. it meant that just last week, she was able to step in when two doctors were self-isolating.  “i had missed being on the frontline. it was a really lovely experience, meeting the staff who are all pulling together, but also many of the patients i knew. it really signifies the gp is the family doctor.”   3dmednet  mr richard kerr says the pandemic has left everyone ""reeling""  when kim, 58, a former frontline nurse, left to teach student nurses and other healthcare workers, she kept her medical licence out of pride and in the knowledge she might one day need it.  “when the chips are down, you’ve got to stand up and be alongside your colleagues.”  and stand up she did. after a 25-year break from working in intensive care, kim has returned as a bank nurse, covering shifts at an intensive care unit.  “it is about being with people at that really terrible time in their lives,"" she says. ""everybody is scared.”  the married mother-of-two says although her skills are a bit “rusty”, the “essential” ones - talking to people, working in a team, and being kind - never leave you. for her, kindness has been the most important part of being back on the frontline.  “the other day, [a patient] had a suitcase with them, and i thought i’d open [it] and see if they had a toothbrush, so i used their own toothbrush to clean their teeth, and sprayed a bit of aftershave on them from their wash bag. i combed their hair and made sure that they were shaved. these human things are really important for us all, it’s to do with our dignity.”  her first week back was a “really big shock” that left her feeling “exhausted and drained”. but she says it is a “privilege” to be back working with colleagues and patients.   dr andrew t cohen  dr andrew t cohen says nhs staff will pull together and help each other  dr andrew t cohen is a retired consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine, at leeds teaching hospitals nhs trust. he says he felt compelled to return to work after reading stories of nhs staff being redeployed to critical care roles.  “it just seemed to me that it was outside of their comfort zone but it was exactly where my comfort zone had been for 35 years as a consultant,” he says.  he says critical care is a “highly pressurised” area and staff in the unit have to be able to deal with extreme stress “even under normal circumstances”.  now, approaching the age of 68, he is conscious he can’t work in the same way he used to. but having been recently re-registered by the general medical council (gmc), he hopes to “free up” younger colleagues to do more urgent work. he says anaesthetists and critical care specialists like him are experts at quickly becoming familiar with different types of equipment - a skill that could come in very useful when hospitals receive new government-ordered ventilators.  “there will be a staff working under a lot of pressure,” he says. “but our speciality is team-based, and people will pull together and help each other.”  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?  meanwhile, mr richard kerr, an honorary consultant neurosurgeon at the oxford university hospitals nhs foundation trust, says he has seen a lot of change in his 40 years working for the health service.  but he says the rapid spread of the virus “has left everyone reeling”.  “i think it’s pretty scary. there’s a degree of uncertainty. but being pragmatic, if we don’t do something about this, it’s only going to get worse.”  the 64-year-old is in discussions about returning to john radcliffe hospital, in oxford, where he performed his last operation - a craniotomy for a brain tumour - in february last year.  mr kerr, a council member of the royal college of surgeons of england, says he could initially return in a supporting role. but he's not ruled out going back to the operating theatre or to more junior ranks - taking bloods and putting up drips.  “i might not get the vein first time,"" he jokes, ""but i can usually get there."""
health,"people should talk to loved ones about their wishes if they were to become critically ill with coronavirus, a palliative care expert has said.  specialists in care for the terminally ill urged people to have ""difficult conversations"" about potential treatment and wishes after death.  baroness ilora finlay, of cardiff university, said patients ""must let people know now"".  it comes after new guidance on palliative care was issued.  the latest official figures show there have been 48 deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in wales and 1,241 confirmed cases.   baroness finlay is a leading authority on palliative medicine  baroness finlay, professor of palliative medicine at cardiff university, said everyone should consider what treatment they would want if they fell ill and their wishes if they died, and then tell their families.  ""up until now, people thought they could plan for everything, but we've finally realised that we live with uncertainty all the time, and it's confronted us head-on,"" she told the politics wales programme.  ""so we have to think now: 'what are the things that really matter to us?' what are the conversations we should have with those we love, now - not tomorrow or the day after - and what do we need to tell them?  ""perhaps we have strong views. perhaps if you're already frail and become ill with this virus, you might feel you don't want to go into hospital and be put on a ventilator.  ""you must let people know now so that things can be put in place for you.  ""those conversations are difficult for everybody. they're never easy. we all live thinking it won't happen to us. but you have to think it might.""  she said practical steps included discussing whether someone has a will, how to access important documents, and labelling items they wished to be given away if they die.   there are currently restrictions on the number of people that can attend funerals  people should also discuss funeral wishes and the options for ""celebrating life in a different way and mourning in a different way"".  but baroness finlay also stressed the importance of taking time to appreciate the moment and find comfort in the little things.  ""the conversation on the phone with someone you love - these are precious moments, don't cut them short,"" she said.  the association for palliative medicine has issued new guidance about symptom management, communication and bereavement care, advising health workers and carers on how to broach discussions with patients and their families.  the new guidance for palliative care professionals says ""honest conversations"" about treatment should start ""as early as is practicable"" and warns that the nature of covid-19 means people can ""deteriorate quite quickly"".  author and palliative care doctor rachel clarke told radio 4's today programme that one of the ""desperate cruelties"" of the virus was it denied critically-ill patients the comfort of loved-one at their bedside.  she echoed the calls for advance planning, saying: ""it's incredibly important to have those conversations now so that families don't end up in the situation where a doctor or nurse says 'do you know what your mum would have wanted?'  ""and your heart falls into your boots because you realise you don't know.""  dr mark taubert, a palliative care doctor from velindre cancer centre in cardiff, said he had been following the situation in italy, where more than 9,000 people had died from coronavirus.  he said doctors there said it had been ""heart-breaking that people are dying and they had to restrict who could see them.""

health,"victor de jesus  john wright spreading the message that people should stay at home  march 29 2020  the covid-19 outbreak has already brought a range of challenges for front line medical staff - shortages of equipment, doctors and nurses falling ill, and even thieves trying to break in and steal valuable supplies. in the first of a series of diaries, dr john wright reports on preparations at bradford royal infirmary.  following the uk-wide lockdown, the hospital followed suit in a bid to limit transmission of the coronavirus.  eighteen entrances across the 26-acre site were sealed off and everyone is now funnelled through one main door. staff must show their passes and patients are no longer allowed to bring visitors with them, even when they're coming in for cancer treatments.  but not long before millions of people across the uk stepped out of their houses and applauded nhs workers, one man carefully dressed in doctor's scrubs. he even completed his disguise with a stethoscope. he then attempted to bluff his way past a security guard, who demanded to see his pass, and when he was caught he made a run for it.   john wright  hospital scrubs are being used as disguise - so now have to be locked away  there had already been thefts of surgical gowns, masks, protective equipment and sanitisers. it's possible this man was after supplies like these, or possibly drugs. the head of the bradford hospital trust, mel pickup, has heard that there are now shortages on the streets because of the epidemic. ""people who have addictions need to feed them,"" she says. ""where do you go if you want drugs and you can't get those on the street any more?""  hospital scrubs are now having to be stored under lock and key.  front line diary   john wright  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research. he has looked after patients in epidemics all over the world, including cholera, hiv and ebola outbreaks in sub-saharan africa. over the next few weeks he will be reporting for the bbc on how his hospital, the bradford royal infirmary, copes with covid-19.  we know from what's been happening in italy how covid-19 is likely to affect us in bradford. multi-generational households are common in italy and also here - particularly among pakistanis, who make up just under a third of the population and are genetically predisposed to heart disease and diabetes, the very underlying health conditions that can make covid-19 particularly deadly. there are poor areas in bradford, and some white people have high levels of lung disease from smoking.  we know there is a tsunami coming.   john wright  at present there are 16 intensive care beds in the hospital and that's usually enough, but it's been projected that we could be treating 500 people at the peak of the epidemic, so we need to ramp up very quickly. a disused ward has been fitted with ventilators and other wards are being reconfigured.  dr debbie horner, in charge of covid-19 intensive care planning, says accepting the scale of what's happening has been like going through the stages of bereavement. ""initially you've got a kind of shock and then comes denial and acceptance,"" she told me. ""as an intensive care community, most of us are now in the kind of acceptance phase.""  find out more  john wright is recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's nhs on the front line  you can hear the next episode at 11:00 on tuesday 31 march, catch up with the first episode online, or download the podcast  we have also been taking steps to obtain more personal protective equipment.  our stocks of surgical masks are good, but supplies of more effective ppe masks and eye-protection visors were running low. so a consultant, dr tom lawton, went to screwfix to buy industrial masks - and then found a way of attaching medical filters to them, using a 3d printer he keeps in his garage. another went to a builders' merchants and bought 2,000 pairs of goggles.   john wright  consultant tom lawton in one of his modified industrial masks  consultant anaesthetist dr michael mccooe, meanwhile, started looking into ways of sterilising masks, so they could be re-used, and called whittaker's gin distillery in the yorkshire dales. mr whittaker himself answered the phone, and said that his 96% proof gin could be diluted for the purpose.  ""he was very happy to donate to us,"" dr mccooe told me. ""he'd been looking into whether they could supply more alcohol to the health service and whether they could make hand sanitiser. it's a great step forward and now we just need somewhere safe to store it all!""  but in the last week or so, both debbie horner and michael mccooe have gone into isolation.   john wright  one of tom lawton's masks after sterilisation in alcohol from the gin distillery  debbie called me on the afternoon of friday 20 march, just before we were going to run our covid-19 case rehearsals, to say that she had some mild symptoms and was going to go home, just to be on the safe side. we haven't yet started testing staff for the virus, but given how important she was, we felt that we needed to make an exception - and so we arranged for a surreptitious visit to accident and emergency on saturday morning to swab for covid-19 and other more likely seasonal viruses.  then, on monday, our microbiologist rang to drop the bombshell: the swab had come back positive.  a day later the clinical director of urgent care, dr sam khan, started to feel unwell. and then dr michael mccooe was forced to self-isolate because his partner, another anaesthetist at the hospital, was ill. it seems likely that we were infecting one another as we planned our response to coronavirus, until we got our social distancing house in order.  if we lose many more of our senior clinical leaders at this early stage of the campaign it would be a disaster.  we have a rapidly increasing number of cases, but it still feels like the calm before the storm. and the eye of the storm will be in our intensive care unit."

health,"dyson  the government has said it will buy thousands of ventilators to help ease the pressure on hospitals caused by the coronavirus crisis.  for patients with the worst effects of the infection, a ventilator can offer the best chance of survival.  what is a ventilator and what does it do?  simply put, a ventilator takes over the body's breathing process when disease has caused the lungs to fail.  this gives the patient time to fight off the infection and recover.  various types of medical ventilation can be used.  according to the world health organization (who), some 80% of people with covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - recover without needing hospital treatment.  but one person in six becomes seriously ill.  in these severe cases, the virus causes damage to the lungs, causing the body's oxygen levels to drop and making it harder to breathe.  to alleviate this, a ventilator is used to push air, with increased levels of oxygen, into the lungs.  the ventilator also has a humidifier, which adds heat and moisture to the air supply so it matches the patient's body temperature.  patients are given medication to relax the respiratory muscles so their breathing can be fully regulated by the machine.     all medical ventilation requires close supervision from trained staff  people with milder symptoms may be given ventilation using facemasks, nasal masks or mouthpieces which allow air or an oxygen mixture to be pushed into the lungs.  this is known as ""non-invasive"" ventilation, as no internal tubes are required.  another form of ventilation - continuous positive airway pressure or cpap - keeps a patient's airways continuously open,  early reports from lombardy in northern italy suggest about 50% of patients given cpap have avoided the need for full mechanical ventilation.  a type of cpap ventilation using a hood, where pressurised oxygen is pumped in via a valve, reduces the risk of airborne transmission of the virus.   intersurgical  oxygen hoods reduce the risk of disease transmission  intensive care units (icus) would generally put patients suffering acute respiratory distress on mechanical ventilation quickly, to ensure oxygen levels in the body stay normal.  however dr shondipon laha, from the intensive care society, told the bbc that unless they become seriously ill, most patients with covid-19 would not need a mechanical ventilator and could be treated at home or with supplementary oxygen.  although there were risks when using ventilators, such as not knowing who would suffer long-term effects, he said, sometimes a ventilator was ""the only way of getting oxygen into the patient"".  another issue, dr laha explained, was having enough trained staff to operate the ventilators correctly.  how many ventilators does the uk have - and how many might we need?  the uk is understood to currently have about 10,000 ventilators having added to the previous stock of just over 8,000 by increasing production and sourcing other machines from overseas.  a number of ventilators have also been acquired from private hospitals.  health secretary matt hancock has said the country needs 18,000 machines for when the virus peaks, down from an original estimate of 30,000.  mr hancock told the bbc's andrew marr programme on 5 april that projected demand had come down because social distancing measures were working.  the exact type of extra ventilators needed, and who makes them, is still being finalised.  the delay is linked to a changing understanding of how to treat patients requiring ventilation, according to the financial times.   the smiths parapac ventilator is designed to be easily transported  a consortium of uk manufacturers is leading efforts to produce a version of a machine built by oxfordshire company penlon. on 16 april, it was announced that the penlon prima eso2 devices had been approved and that hundreds are expected to be built for hospitals over the next week. by the start of may, it is hoped that 1,500 a week will be made.  as part of that same initiative, the first ventilators - portable parapac devices from luton-based firm smiths - have been delivered to wards over the last few days.  the consortium includes airbus, rolls royce and a number of formula one racing teams.  a separate machine being designed and built from scratch by dyson is also being considered by the government.  production of other types of non-invasive ventilator is also being scaled up, with a government order of some 10,000 ventura cpap devices designed by university college london engineers with industry partners mercedes-amg-hpp."
health,"there have been long queues as drive-through restaurants reopen, pubs have sold takeaway pints in the warm weather and supermarket deliveries remain elusive for many.  but what are the covid-19 risks if you get a takeaway or a delivery?  what about takeaways?  many local restaurants have reinvented themselves as takeaways.  covid-19 is a respiratory illness; there is no evidence it can be spread via any food or food packaging. and reputable chains and good restaurant kitchens are most likely to be geared towards professional, hygienic food preparation, meaning there would be minimal risk from a freshly cooked takeaway meal.  with social distancing and extra hygiene measures in place, high street chains - such as pret a manger - now offer customer takeaways and online delivery. marks and spencer has reopened 49 of its cafes for takeaway only.  dozens of kfc outlets are reopening for either delivery or drive-through purchases - or both. mcdonald's and burger king have also reopened some drive-through restaurants - prompting long traffic queues.  deliveroo and just eat have issued guidance on how their riders can stay safe and make food deliveries without touching restaurant packaging.     delivery drivers queue at a mcdonald's in east london  should i eat with my hands?  if you get a takeaway delivery, the risk of packaging contamination can be minimised.  ""empty the contents [into a clean dish], dispose of the packaging into a refuse bag and wash your hands thoroughly before you eat,"" advises prof sally bloomfield, of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine.  ""take food out of a container with a spoon and eat it with a knife and fork - not your fingers.""  it might be better in the current circumstances to order hot, freshly cooked food, rather than cold or raw items. the food standards agency does stress the risk from food is low and ""there is no reason to avoid having ready-to-eat food delivered if it has been prepared and handled properly"".  for the most cautious and vulnerable though, careful preparation and cooking may be reassuring.  ""with a pizza for example, if you wanted to be really safe, you could even pop it into the microwave for a couple of minutes,"" prof bloomfield adds.     what about takeaway drinks?  some licensed premises - forced to shut because of the coronavirus restrictions - have continued to sell drinks to takeaway customers.  pubs and bars should enforce social distancing and extra hygiene measures if they are open - such as making sure staff wear gloves when handling disposable cups.  it is legal to drink in public in the uk, except in areas where public space protection orders are in place. local councils in scotland set their own rules on when and where you can drink. but social distancing rules remain, and the police have powers to confiscate alcohol and move people on.     signwriting in brighton as coronavirus restrictions are eased  how safe are supermarket deliveries?  delivery slots permitting, a home food drop is less risky than a trip to a supermarket as you will avoid other shoppers.  any risk would be the possible contamination of food or packaging - handled by other people - or from the delivery driver.  you could leave a note on your door asking drivers to ring the bell and step back, but prof bloomfield says there's no such thing as ""zero risk"".  ""for contained or packaged goods, either store them for 72 hours before using them - or spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with bleach [carefully diluted as directed on the bottle].  ""for unwrapped fresh goods, which could have been handled by anyone - wash thoroughly under running water and leave to dry,"" she adds.  prof alison sinclair, a virology expert from the university of sussex, adds: ""there should be no more risk from using online deliveries than using a friend or volunteer to collect groceries for you.""  some experts also advise using plastic bags only once during this pandemic.  but if i do go to the supermarket?  coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. these can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or potentially if you touch a surface they have landed on.  so going shopping and mixing with other people does carry a risk. that is why social distancing - keeping at least 2m (about 6ft) from others - is so important, and many shops are enforcing it.     queuing outside an asda store in west yorkshire  supermarkets can provide an ""ideal setting"" for virus transfer, says prof bloomfield. ""many people are touching and replacing items, checkout belts, cash cards, car park ticket machine buttons, atm payment buttons, paper receipts etc... not to mention being in the proximity of several other people.""  there are ways to offset these risks:  wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand sanitiser before and after shopping  treat surfaces as if they may be contaminated, meaning you avoid touching your face after handling shopping trolleys, baskets, packages and produce  use contactless payment methods  follow victoria on twitter"
health,"police officers from north yorkshire police stop motorists in cars to check that their travel is ""essential""  people are heeding the advice to stay at home to keep pressure off the nhs, and there are early signs that it is working, the uk's chief scientific adviser has said.  sir patrick vallance told a news conference that social distancing measures are ""making a difference"".  transmission of coronavirus in the community is thought to be decreasing, which could mean fewer infections.  hospital admissions data suggests cases are not rising as fast as feared.  there are currently 9,000 people in hospitals in england with coronavirus, up from 6,000 on friday.  this amounts to about one in ten of all hospital beds in the country.  the latest number of deaths announced in the uk of people with the virus has reached 1,408.  the deaths include a further 159 people in england, six in scotland, 14 in wales and one in northern ireland.  sir patrick said the nhs was seeing around an additional 1,000 patients a day and described this daily rise as ""stable"".  ""that shows that it's going up not in an increasing amount but in a constant amount, which may suggest that we're already beginning to see some effect,"" he said.  after the daily number of deaths fell for the second day, he also cautioned against paying ""too much attention"" to day-to-day fluctuations in figures, explaining ""we need to look over time and see what's happening"".  of the 1,000-a-day rise in hospital patients, he told reporters at the daily briefing: ""i do expect that number to continue. i expect people coming every day to be about that, it may go up a little bit.  ""and in two or three weeks you would expect that to stabilise and to start to go down a bit.""  he said the figures suggested the uk was ""not on a fast acceleration"" - but warned that ""we expect this to get worse"" over the next couple of weeks because of the ""lag"" in social distancing measures taking effect.  he said it was ""premature"" to put a timescale on how long social distancing measures would need to be in place.  he said instead the focus needed to be on making sure hospital admissions were not accelerating above a level that the nhs could cope with.  among those who have died was 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant amged el-hawrani who died at glenfield hospital in leicester, on saturday.  his death follows that of an organ transplant consultant last week, who became the first working nhs surgeon to die after testing positive for the virus.  mr el-hawrani's brother paid tribute to him on monday as a hero - ""just like every doctor and every nurse and anyone working at the nhs"".  he added that his brother ""would have been heavily exposed"" to the virus.  ""he worked so hard, both private and nhs, at many hospitals. he saw hundreds and hundreds of patients. we don't know how many patients he was exposed to.""  a blip or a glimmer of hope?  by robert cuffe, head of statistics, bbc news  there is a glimmer of hope in these figures: had deaths continued to grow at that recent daily rate of roughly a third a day, we might have expected to see 350 new deaths on sunday and 450 today.  instead, we've seen slight falls: 260 deaths on saturday, 209 on sunday and a further fall to 180 today.  but we shouldn't get carried away too soon: last week's sunday-into-monday figures also showed slight dips on the previous saturday.  but by tuesday, they resumed the upward march.  it's still too soon to know whether this is a real ray of hope, a blip caused by different working practices at the weekend or some mixture of the two.  special hospitals are being set up in birmingham, manchester, glasgow, cardiff and london, where a new nightingale hospital with 4,000 to 5,000 beds has been set up at the excel centre. it will start receiving its first patients this week.  around one in four doctors are off work at the moment either with symptoms or isolating because family members have symptoms, the head of the royal college of physicians estimated.  bbc health editor hugh pym said: ""you talk to people on the front line and there is intense pressure. staffing is a problem... they say it's very, very difficult, particularly in london. the situation for staffing is getting worse in birmingham, and as one source put it - normal wards are turning into covid wards.  ""so you can build new hospitals, bring back volunteers - people who've retired, nurses and doctors, and so on - but staffing them, i think, is going to be an issue.""  in other developments, the foreign secretary dominic raab has announced measures to help britons stranded abroad.  airlines including ba, virgin and easyjet will work with the government to help fly tens of thousands of britons back to the uk. mr raab said the foreign office has also set aside £75m to charter special flights where commercial ones are unavailable.  elsewhere, clarence house confirmed the prince of wales is now out of self-isolation, following his diagnosis of coronavirus last week. a palace official said prince charles, 71, was in good health.  'get through the crisis together'  in a video posted online on sunday, prime minister boris johnson said the public appeared to be obeying the restrictions set out by government to slow the spread of the virus, adding that train use was down 95% and bus use down 75%.   hm government  the prime minister also confirmed 20,000 former nhs staff have returned to work to help deal with the coronavirus outbreak, adding the country would get through the crisis ""together"".  in pictures: daily life with the coronavirus  mr johnson - who became the first world leader to announce he had the virus - has continued to lead the country's response to the pandemic, carrying out meetings over video link while self-isolating in his downing street flat.  on monday, a no 10 source confirmed that his chief adviser dominic cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating at home.  in other developments:"
health,"i am supposed to be starting university in september. is there any point in me going this year or shall i defer until next year?  ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now.  a recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally.  university campuses have been closed this term by the covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. the university of cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the university of manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year.  before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, office for students, says your university should give you “absolute clarity” on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. and if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in august.  once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses.  also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal."
health,"the world is shutting down. places that were once teeming with the hustle and bustle of daily life have become ghost-towns with massive restrictions put on our lives - from lockdowns and school closures to travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings.  it is an unparalleled global response to a disease. but when will it end and when will we be able to get on with our lives?  prime minister boris johnson has said he believes the uk can ""turn the tide"" against the outbreak within the next 12 weeks and the country can ""send coronavirus packing"".  but even if the number of cases starts to fall in the next three months, then we will still be far from the end.  it can take a long time for the tide to go out - possibly years.  it is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. the social and economic damage would be catastrophic.  what countries need is an ""exit strategy"" - a way of lifting the restrictions and getting back to normal.  but the coronavirus is not going to disappear.  if you lift the restrictions that are holding the virus back, then cases will inevitably soar.  ""we do have a big problem in what the exit strategy is and how we get out of this,"" says mark woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the university of edinburgh.  ""it's not just the uk, no country has an exit strategy.""  it is a massive scientific and societal challenge.  there are essentially three ways out of this mess.  vaccination  enough people develop immunity through infection  or permanently change our behaviour/society  each of these routes would reduce the ability of the virus to spread.  vaccines - at least 12-18 months away  a vaccine should give someone immunity so they do not become sick if they are exposed.  immunise enough people, about 60% of the population, and the virus cannot cause outbreaks - the concept known as herd immunity.  the first person was given an experimental vaccine in the us this week after researchers were allowed to skip the usual rules of performing animal tests first.  vaccine research is taking place at unprecedented speed, but there is no guarantee it will be successful and will require immunisation on a global scale.  the best guess is a vaccine could still be 12 to 18-months away if everything goes smoothly. that is a long time to wait when facing unprecedented social restrictions during peacetime.  ""waiting for a vaccine should not be honoured with the name 'strategy', that is not a strategy,"" prof woolhouse told the bbc.     a cough is one of the symptoms of covid-19  natural immunity - at least two years away  the uk's short-term strategy is to drive down cases as much as possible to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed - when you run out of intensive care beds then deaths spike.  once cases are suppressed, it may allow some measures to be lifted for a while - until cases rise and another round of restrictions are needed.  when this might be is uncertain. the uk's chief scientific advisor, sir patrick vallance, said ""putting absolute timelines on things is not possible"".  doing this could, unintentionally, lead to herd immunity as more and more people were infected.  but this could take years to build up, according to prof neil ferguson from imperial college london: ""we're talking about suppressing transmission at a level whereby, hopefully, only a very small fraction of the country will be infected.  ""so eventually, if we continued this for two-plus years, maybe a sufficient fraction of the country at that point might have been infected to give some degree of community protection.""  but there is a question mark over whether this immunity will last. other coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms, lead to a very weak immune response and people can catch the same bug multiple times in their lifetime.  alternatives - no clear endpoint  ""the third option is permanent changes in our behaviour that allow us to keep transmission rates low,"" prof woolhouse said.  this could include keeping some of the measures that have been put in place. or introducing rigorous testing and isolation of patients to try to stay on top of any outbreaks.  ""we did early detection and contact tracing the first time round and it didn't work,"" prof woolhouse adds.  developing drugs that can successfully treat a covid-19 infection could aid the other strategies too.  they could be used as soon as people show symptoms in a process called ""transmission control"" to stop them passing it onto others.  or to treat patients in hospital to make the disease less deadly and reduce pressures on intensive care. this would allow countries to cope with more cases before needing to reintroduce lockdowns.  increasing the number of intensive care beds would have a similar effect by increasing the capacity to cope with larger outbreaks.  i asked the uk's chief medical adviser, prof chris whitty, what his exit strategy was.  he told me: ""long term, clearly a vaccine is one way out of this and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.""  and that ""globally, science will come up with solutions"".  follow james on twitter"
health,"for the first time, people in england are being advised to wear face coverings in some enclosed spaces.  the scottish government already recommends people wear them when in shops and on public transport.  wearing a face covering can prevent an infected person passing on the virus, rather than stopping someone contracting it.  what is the new advice?  the government for england says:  people should aim to wear face coverings on public transport and in some shops  also in other ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet""  ""social distancing"" means staying more than two metres away from someone  face coverings should be worn and not surgical masks or respirators which should be left for healthcare staff and other workers who need them  people do not need to wear face coverings where they are:  outdoors or while exercising  in schools  in workplaces such as offices and shops  children under two or primary aged children who cannot use them without assistance  people who have problems breathing while wearing a face covering  advice in wales has not changed and face coverings have not yet been recommended for the general public. people in northern ireland have been told to consider wearing face coverings if they are in places where they cannot social distance.  why doesn't everyone wear a mask now?  the advice talks about face coverings, rather than masks.  the world health organization (who) currently says only two groups of people should wear protective masks, those who are:  sick and showing symptoms  caring for people suspected to have coronavirus  it says medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers.  masks are not generally recommended for the public because:  they can be contaminated by other people's coughs and sneezes, or when putting them on or removing them  frequent hand-washing and social distancing are more effective  they might offer a false sense of security  but that doesn't mean they have no benefit at all for the general public - it's just that the scientific evidence is weak.  homemade cloth face-coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances - they might help stop the spread of coronavirus by people who are contagious but have no symptoms (known as asymptomatic transmission).  scientists in singapore suggest that risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease.  coronavirus is spread by droplets that can spray into the air when those infected talk, cough and sneeze. these can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object.     what face masks are used by health workers?  the most protective mask is an ffp3 or, alternatively, an n95 or an ffp2.  nhs staff in lower-risk situations can wear a surgical mask. this includes healthcare workers within one metre of a patient with possible or confirmed covid-19. these staff may be in hospitals, primary care, ambulance trusts, community care settings and care homes.  where am i supposed to get a face covering?  there is lots of advice online about how to make them.  suggestions include using common household items, such as cotton fabric from old t-shirts or bedding.  the government has published advice on how to wear and make your own cloth face covering which says:  a cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably  it can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head  wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off and after use  avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?  what else can protect against coronavirus?  gloves and other protective wear are recommended for nhs staff working in places where they could encounter coronavirus.  again, staff in the highest-risk scenarios are advised to wear fuller protection, rather than a simple apron, gloves, mask and goggles.  the general public are not advised to wear gloves or any other protective gear.  to protect yourself from coronavirus, the nhs recommends regular and through hand washing, covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and not touching your face with unwashed hands."
health,"anyone with coronavirus symptoms should get tested so covid-19 can be controlled as the lockdown eases, says health secretary matt hancock.  but the uk statistics watchdog has criticised the government's handling of the testing data.  so how much testing is being done?  can i get tested?  in england and wales anyone with symptoms can get a swab test.  in northern ireland and scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested.  people working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms.  how many tests are being carried out?  during the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings.  on sunday, matt hancock announced the uk had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of may - describing it as ""an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus"".  but only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 bst that day - and that figure includes testing kits posted out to homes.  the chairman of the uk statistics authority has now criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"".  sir david norgrove has written to mr hancock saying the information is ""far from complete"", presented in a way that is ""difficult to understand"", and relevant figures may be ""misleadingly"" described.  he points out:  there is no data on how many of the tests posted out are then successfully completed  it's not clear from the daily data how many people are tested more than once  some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test doesn't work.  sir david is also calling for more detailed data on those being tested. he wants age, sex, location and job to be included - such as working in a care home or hospital.  the government says it releases full data.  a spokesman said the government was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to ""increase transparency around the government's response to coronavirus"".  how does the test work?  the test finds out if you currently have the virus.  it involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or by someone else.     these tests won't show if you have had covid-19 in the past and since recovered.  antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples from patients.  the uk now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only being offered to health and care staff.  why is testing important?  testing is essential if the contact-tracing systems now in place in all four uk nations are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for uk-wide lockdowns.  tests can also help people, including nhs workers, know whether they are safe to go to work.  they can also let the health service plan for extra demand and inform government decisions around social distancing and lockdowns.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption bbc reality check looks at why testing matters  what is contact tracing?  people who test positive for covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms.  close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes.  read more about contact tracing in england, scotland, wales and northern ireland.  where do i get tested?  there are several options.  you can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered to your door.  the government says home test kits will be limited at first, because of a lack of availability.  testing at an nhs facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some nhs workers.     how long will it take to get a result?  couriers will collect samples and take them to laboratories.  the government says it aims to return test results within 48 hours of a swab being taken, or within 72 hours for a home test.  speed is important if the contact-tracing systems across the uk are to work well - because delays will give the virus more time to spread.  speaking the day before england's tracing system was launched, prime minister boris johnson said there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours. but the department of health and social care said no formal deadline had been set to achieve this.  on the same day, the head of england's test and trace programme, dido harding, said 84% of tests at drive-through centres were returned within 24 hours, and 95% within 48 hours.  she didn't provide a figure for home testing kits or those provided at other settings.  follow rachel on twitter  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?

health,"loss of smell or taste have been added to the uk's list of coronavirus symptoms that people should be aware of and ready to act upon.  what are the coronavirus symptoms?  scientific advisers told the uk government to update its advice. it now says the symptoms to look out for are:  a new, continuous cough  fever  loss of smell or taste  if you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others.  the cough is a new, continuous one, where you cough a lot for more than an hour, or have three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. you have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8c.  the us centers for disease control and prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat.  it takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. the world health organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days.  when do people need to go to hospital?  the majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol).  the main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing.  doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed.  however, people should not go to a&e if they are concerned. in the uk, the nhs 111 website will guide you through what to do.  if you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency.  if you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling nhs 111.  what happens in intensive care?  intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill.  coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose.  the most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.  what should i do if i have mild symptoms?  patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days.  people are advised not to ring nhs 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. they should also not go to their gp, or a&e.  details for scotland are to check nhs inform, then ring your gp in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. in wales call nhs 111, and in northern ireland, call your gp.  if you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate.  the world health organization has also issued advice for the public.  older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?  how do i protect myself?  the best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.  coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. these can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.  so, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important.  people will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick.  in england and scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus.  follow james on twitter.  this explainer will be regularly updated to reflect the audience's questions about coronavirus. details of how to get in touch are below.  what questions do you have about the coronavirus?  in some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise. your contact details will never be published. please ensure you have read our terms & conditions and privacy policy.  use this form to ask your question:"
health,"the coronavirus emerged in only december last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - covid-19.  for most, the disease is mild, but some people die.  so how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?  incubation period  this is when the virus is establishing itself.  viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.  the coronavirus, officially called sars-cov-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.  it first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.  at this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.  the incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption everything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the bbc's laura foster  mild disease  this is all most people will experience.  covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.  body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.  the fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. it has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.  these rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.  the coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.  some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.  these symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. you won't need specialist hospital care.  this stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.  however, some will develop a more serious form of covid-19.  this is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.  severe disease  if the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.  those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.  ""the virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said dr nathalie macdermott, from king's college london.   spl  scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia  inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.  if it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.  this is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.  some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.  this stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from china.  critical disease  it is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.  by this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.  the problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.  it can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.  acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. it can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.  ""the virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" dr bharat pankhania said.  and if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.  treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ecmo or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.  this is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.  but eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.  the first deaths  doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.  the first two patients to die at jinyintan hospital in wuhan, china, detailed in the lancet medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.  the first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.  he was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.  he died 11 days after he was admitted.  the second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.  he was attached to an ecmo machine but this wasn't enough. he died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.  follow james on twitter."
health,"antibodies test a medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. the test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease.  asymptomatic someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature.  containment phase the first part of the uk's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them.  coronavirus one of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. the coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease covid-19. the common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses.  covid-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in wuhan, china, in late 2019. it primarily affects the lungs.  delay phase the second part of the uk's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread.  fixed penalty notice a fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. these are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown.  flatten the curve health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. if a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. however, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. this makes it easier for health systems to cope.  flu short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics.  furlough supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. it allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working.  herd immunity how the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it.  immune a person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time.  incubation period the period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms.  intensive care hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. they are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment.  lockdown restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.  mitigation phase the third part of the uk's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. this could mean the nhs halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only.  nhs 111 the nhs's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. people in england and wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. in scotland, they should check nhs inform, then ring their gp in office hours or 111 out of hours. in northern ireland, they should call their gp.  outbreak multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations.  pandemic an epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously.  phase 2 this is when the uk will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus.  ppe ppe, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease.  quarantine the isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread.  r0 r0, pronounced ""r-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. if the r0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. the value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread.  recession this happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods.  sars severe

health,"most people with coronavirus will recover within about a week of getting symptoms and will not need medical care.  but some people will need to be treated in hospital - as the prime minister was.  boris johnson, who is 55, has been discharged from st thomas' hospital in london after being in intensive care.  he was given oxygen, but didn't need a ventilator machine to help his breathing.  chief medical officer chris whitty has said male sex is ""a very clear risk factor"". but why?  which people can get sick?  some people are at higher risk of complications.  this includes people over the age of 70, regardless of whether they have a medical condition or not, and people of any age with underlying health conditions such as heart disease.  there are more than 1.5 million people in the uk who are at the greatest risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus.  this includes people with cancer who have been receiving chemotherapy, and they are being asked to stay at home all of the time to shield themselves from the virus.  coronavirus also appears to disproportionately affect men in their 50s and 60s to a certain degree, although they are not singled out as a high risk group. but it's not that clear-cut. correlation isn't necessarily cause.  why older men?  scientists are unsure.  uk data from intensive care hospital wards shows the average patient who is critically ill is aged 60. most are men and many have other health conditions that could put them at increased risk, such as heart problems and obesity.  of the 647 coronavirus-related deaths registered by the office for national statistics in england and wales up to the week ending 27th march, 44 were aged 45-65 - around 7% of the total.  death rates go up with age in both men and women, but men tend to outstrip women across the ages.  data from china, where the pandemic began, also suggests men are at greater risk than women, although experts caution there could be factors other than gender, such as smoking habits, that could explain the link.  prof ian hall, professor of molecular medicine, university of nottingham, said: ""i am not convinced this completely explains the increased risk of severe disease in men, so it seems possible there may be some other as yet unidentified factor playing a role.""  men are more likely than women to have heart disease, diabetes and chronic lung disease.  some have suggested genes and sex hormones might be involved too.  are women more immune?  prof philip goulder, an expert in immunology at university of oxford, said: ""it is becoming increasingly recognised that there are substantial differences in the immune system between males and females and that these have significant impact on outcome from a wide range of infectious diseases.  ""the immune response throughout life to vaccines and infections is typically more aggressive and more effective in females compared to males.""  this could be down to women carrying two copies of the x chromosome, compared to the single x and a y that men have.  a number of critical immune genes are located on the x chromosome, he says.  is coronavirus causing the deaths?  every year, about 600,000 people in the uk die. people with underlying health conditions and the elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus.  the office for national statistics has been assessing how many of the deaths linked to coronavirus might be as a direct result of the virus.  this analysis suggests that most (86% or 3,372) of the 4,000 deaths linked to coronavirus in march were likely caused by the virus, although around nine in every ten of those who died had a pre-existing health condition.  the coronavirus death rate was twice as high for men compared to women - 97.5 deaths per 100,000 population versus 46.5 deaths per 100,000.  how can you protect yourself?  stay as fit and healthy as you can by exercising and eating a balanced diet.  if you smoke, now is a good time to quit.  men are more likely than women to:  smoke and smoke more cigarettes per day and smoke hand-rolled tobacco  eat too much salt  eat too much red and processed meat  eat too little fruit and too few vegetables  drink alcohol and drink at hazardous levels  coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. these can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.  so, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important.  what if i get coronavirus symptoms?  if you have a new, continuous cough or a fever you should stay at home and self-isolate for at least seven days.  if you, or someone you live with, develop symptoms, the entire household needs to isolate for 14 days to monitor for signs of the disease.  what should i do if my symptoms don't get better?  the main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing.  in the uk, the nhs 111 website will guide you through what you need to do.  if you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words then you will be told to call 999 as this is a medical emergency.  if you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then the website will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling nhs 111."

health,"advertisement  black, asian and minority ethnic (bame) people are more likely to die from covid-19, a government review has confirmed.  the public health england (phe) report revealed britons of bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of white brits of dying with the coronavirus.  and it showed black people, as well as those of chinese, indian, pakistani, other asian, or caribbean backgrounds had between a 10 and 50 per cent higher risk of death. the analysis did not take into account higher rates of long-term health conditions among these people, which experts say probably account for some of the differences.  evidence compiled in the report also revealed that age is the single biggest risk factor that determines how likely people are to die with the virus - those over the age of 80 are 70 times more likely to be killed than under-40s.  and health conditions which appeared often on people's death certificates were heart disease, diabetes - understood to be type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and dementia. more than one in five victims had diabetes, the data showed, which was a significantly higher rate than in people who died of other causes.  poorer, more deprived people faced a higher risk of dying and men working in lower-paid jobs - such as security guards, bus drivers and construction workers - also had worse chances of survival if they contracted the virus.  health chiefs launched a probe to investigate the disproportionate impact of covid-19 on bame brits in april, prompted by a wave of evidence that showed white people were less likely to die from the disease.  health secretary matt hancock, speaking in parliament today, said: 'black lives matter,' and pledged action to try and reduce health inequalities between different communities in the uk.  he was pushed to deny that the release of the report - which was supposed to happen in may - had not been delayed because of political tensions in the wake of the death of american man george floyd. he said in the house of commons: 'we've published it and brought it to the house at the earliest possible opportunity.'  mr hancock admitted that the report has 'exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation' and his counterpart in the labour party, shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth, noted: 'covid thrives on inequalities'.  doctors still don't know exactly what is increasing non-white people's risk of death, but phe's report adds to a growing body of evidence proving the link exists. one paper presented to government advisers in sage suggested that higher-than-average rates of type 2 diabetes among black and south asian people may be to blame - the condition is known to increase risk of covid-19 death.  data in the public health england report showed that the mortality rate - the number of people dying with the coronavirus out of each 100,000 people - was considerably higher for black men than other group. the risk for black women, people of asian ethnicity, and mixed race people was also higher than for white people of either sex. the report warned the rate for the 'other' category was 'likely to be an overestimate'  covid-19 can be seen to have had a significant effect on the numbers of men dying (dark green) in all ethnic groups but particularly for black and asian men  covid-19 can be seen to have had a significant effect on the numbers of women dying (dark green) in all ethnic groups but particularly for black and asian women  black men and women appeared to be at much higher risk of getting diagnosed with covid-19, compared to other ethnic groups. the 'other' group is not likely to be accurate because of disparities in the data and small numbers  while white people make up a majority of covid-19 hospital cases, they are more likely to be treated on normal wards with less severe infection. for adults in all other ethnic groups, however, there are higher rates of intensive care admission than there are admissions for low-level care  the public health england report found:  covid-19 diagnosis rates - which reflect the numbers of people with serious disease - were higher in older age groups for both sexes;  death became considerably more likely with age. compared with under-40s, the risk of death was tripled for people in their 40s, nine times higher among people in their 50s, 27 times higher among people in their 60s, 50 times higher for those in their 70s and a staggering 70 times higher for over-80s;  working age men diagnosed with the virus were twice as likely to die as women of the same age;  urban areas have considerably higher death rates from the virus - that of london was more than treble what was seen in the south west of england;  people living in the most deprived areas of england were more likely both to be diagnosed with the virus and also to die of it. this may be because they had riskier jobs or lived in densely-populated areas where the virus could spread;  black, asian and ethnic minority people faced a greater risk of dying with the coronavirus than white people. reasons are unclear but greater prevalence of serious health conditions is thought to contribute;  medical workers are at a higher risk of catching or dying with the coronavirus. the phe report repeated findings from the office for national statistics that men in less well-paid jobs were also at higher risk;  diabetes, mainly type 2 diabetes, is found at significantly higher rates among people who died of covid-19 than in people who died of other causes, suggesting it increases risk. the same was found to be true of high blood pressure, kidney disease and dementia.  and another study done by king's college hospital in london found that bame coronavirus patients there were, on average, 11 years younger than the white patients - 63 compared to 74.  phe's report came under fire for not answering these questions and for failing to bring forward any recommendations that the government or public could act on to reduce the risk for bame people.  matt hancock says he 'shares anger about racial injustice' health secretary matt hancock insisted 'black lives matter' and that he 'shares the anger about racial injustice felt around the world' as he denied delaying a report on the heightened bame risk from coronavirus. denying that the government tried to hold off publication of an official inquiry into high bame deaths rates to avoid inflaming racial tensions, mr hancock told the daily downing street briefing the findings were 'timely'. 'this is a particularly timely publication, because right across the world, people are angry about racial injustice,' he said. 'and i get that. black lives matter.' the public health england report appeared to be rushed out this afternoon after a wave of criticism that it might be withheld amid the angry scenes on the streets in the us. labour's keir starmer had demanded the government stop making 'excuses' and reveal the findings. it found that bame individuals have a much higher risk of death than white people, as do those from poorer backgrounds, men and anyone who is obese or suffering from diabetes. at the briefing mr hancock said that he valued the contributions 'equally' of 'everyone who works in the nhs and in social care'. 'i want you to know that our whole country cares about your wellbeing,' he said. he added that he 'valued those who come to our country to work in the nhs and in social care'. but just days ago the government was humiliated into scrapping a £624 charge for migrant care workers to use the nhs. 'and i love that this country is one of the most welcoming and tolerant and diverse,' he continued. advertisement  labour's shadow equalities minister, marsha de cordova, said: 'having the information is a start – but now is the time for action.  the highest diagnosis rates per 100,000 population were in black people (486 females and 649 males), the phe review found. the lowest were in white people (220 in females and 224 in males).  compared to previous years, death from all causes was almost four times higher than expected among black males, almost three times higher in asian males and almost two times higher in white males.  among females, deaths were almost three times higher in this period in black, mixed and other females, and 2.4 times higher in asian females compared with 1.6 times in white females.  the highest death rates of confirmed cases per 100,000 population were among people in 'other' ethnic groups (234 females and 427 males) followed by people of black ethnic groups (119 females and 257 males) and asian ethnic groups (78 females and 163 males).  in comparison, the death rates of confirmed cases in white people was 36 per 100,000 females and 70 per 100,000 males.  the report has been welcomed but also sparked outrage because it does not explain why bame people are at a higher risk, nor propose anything that can be done about it.  marsha de cordova mp, labour’s shadow women and equalities secretary, said: 'this review confirms what we already knew - that racial and health inequalities amplify the risks of covid-19. those in the poorest households and people of colour are disproportionately impacted.  'but when it comes to the question of how we reduce these disparities, it is notably silent. it presents no recommendations. having the information is a start – but now is the time for action.  'the government must not wait any longer to mitigate the risks faced by these communities and must act immediately to protect bame people so that no more lives are lost.'  sally warren, director of policy at the king’s fund health think-tank, said: 'we’ve known for many years that these groups typically have worse health outcomes, but there has been disappointingly little effort over the last decade to address inequalities and improve people’s health.  'the scandal is not that the virus has disproportionately affected certain groups, but that it has taken a global pandemic to shine a light on deeply-entrenched health inequalities.'  facing questions in parliament today about why the release of the report had been pushed back, matt hancock denied it was because of increased sensitivity about racism in the light of protests and riots in the us.  crowds gathered in london, manchester and cardiff over the weekend to demonstrate against institutional racism, as widespread protests continue in the us after a white policeman killed an unarmed black man, george floyd, by kneeling on his neck for nine minutes.  conservative mp for east surrey, clair coutinho, asked whether this had factored into a decision not to release the report on time. mr hancock said: 'i can absolutely confirm that [it hasn't].'  sage study claims illness and deprivation account for higher death rate among bame britons black, asian and minority ethnic people are no more likely to die from coronavirus than white people, a study given to government scientists has found. research presented to number 10's sage panel found there was no greater risk of death for brits of bame backgrounds when all factors were taken into account. it showed that 'comorbidities' - long-term health problems - appeared to account for higher rates of hospitalisation and intensive care among ethnic minority people. risk among bame communities has been a sensitive topic during britain's outbreak and even given rise to calls for extra protection for non-white nhs staff. statistics show bame people in britain are dying of covid-19 at disproportionate rates, but scientists have struggled to explain why. the research - done by scientists from the universities of edinburgh and liverpool - was one of around a dozen secret papers published last night by the government. it did, however, claim bame people did seem to be more likely to end up in intensive care in the first place. the sage paper was met with scepticism, however, with one intensive care doctor saying the data it contained did not line up with what the scientists claimed. oxford university's professor duncan young said: 'i’m not sure why they thought black patients were more at risk of icu care. 'the take-home message is that bame patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 are no more likely to end up in icu nor are they more likely to die.'  the health secretary added: 'when i asked phe to undertake this piece of work i asked them to produce it by the end of may, which they did.  'they delivered it to me on sunday and we've published it and brought it to the house at the earliest possible opportunity.'  mr hancock admitted the report has exposed inequality across the uk and that non-white people were suffering worse health and now dying of coronavirus because of their social standing.  black, asian and minority ethnic people have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, which increase the risk of someone dying if they catch covid-19.  they are also twice as likely as white people to live in poverty, more likely to have lower-paid jobs, and more likely to live in densely-populated areas of cities and towns which may put them at higher risk of catching the coronavirus.  mr hancock said of the phe report: 'this is very timely work. people are understandably angry about injustices and as health secretary i feel a deep responsibility because this pandemic has exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation.  'it is very clear that some people are significantly more vulnerable to covid-19 and this is something i'm determined to understand in full and take action to address.'  he added: 'black lives matter, as do those of the poorest areas of our country which have worse health outcomes, and we need to make sure all of these considerations are taken into account, and action is taken to level-up the health outcomes of people across this country.  'because there's no more important levelling-up than the levelling-up of your life expectancy and the quality of health with which you live that life.'  shadow health and social care secretary jonathan ashworth said in parliament: 'we've always known that there was a social gradient in health - the poorest and most deprived have inequality in access to health care and an inequality in health outcomes.  'what [mr hancock] has confirmed today is that covid thrives on inequalities.  'yes, indeed, black lives matter but it is surely a call to action that black, asian and minority ethnic people are more likely to die from covid and more likely to be admitted to intensive care from covid.'  according to data from the office for national statistics, black men and women are four times more likely to suffer a coronavirus-related death than white people.  age: older people are more likely to die with covid-19  phe's report found that someone's age was the single biggest factor that made them more likely to die with covid-19. the older someone is, the higher their risk of dying.  public health england's data showed there were considerably more cases of coronavirus among older age groups  they were also more likely to be diagnosed because their risk of severe disease was higher, meaning they were more likely to end up in hospital and therefore get tested.  analysing survival among confirmed coronavirus patients, the report found the risk of death was three times as high for people aged between 40 and 49 as it was for under-40s.  compared with under-40s, the risk of death was nine times higher among people in their 50s, 27 times higher among people in their 60s, 50 times higher for those in their 70s and a staggering 70 times higher for over-80s.  the report said: 'these are the largest disparities by far found in this analysis'.  illness: heart disease, diabetes and dementia most common among covid-19 victims  people with 'underlying health conditions' have been at the heart of fears about the coronavirus and the public health england report shows they are at considerably higher risk of dying with the disease.  the most common condition among people who died with the virus was heart disease, which was found in almost half of patients, but this rate was comparable to its prevalence in people who die of any condition.  diabetes, however - understood to refer to type 2 diabetes - was found in 21.1 per cent of covid-19 victims, compared to just 14.6 per cent of people who died of any cause. this shows it increases the risk of dying of the coronavirus.  the risk was also higher for high blood pressure (hypertensive diseases), which was found in 19.6 per cent of covid-19 victims but only 14.5 per cent of all deaths.  dementia was also slightly higher, at 25.7 per cent from 23.8 per cent, along with kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).  the report added: 'several studies, although measuring the different outcomes from covid-19, report an increased risk of adverse outcomes in obese or morbidly obese people.'  cardiovascular (heart) disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia are found to be the conditions most common among people who die with the coronavirus. heart disease is more common among bangladeshi and pakistani communities than among white people, and type 2 diabetes is more common in bame people. dementia is more common in white people  occupation: men in lower-paid jobs the most at risk  the phe report said that healthcare workers made up more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases at the time it was compiled, which was likely a direct result of their jobs.  it repeated a finding from the office for national statistics (ons) last month that men working in lower-paid jobs 'had significantly higher death rates from covid-19' along with both men and women working in social care.  as examples of the men whose jobs appeared to put them at risk it said security guards, taxi drivers, chauffeurs, bus drivers, chefs, retail assistants, construction workers and factory employees were dying at higher rates.  reasons for this are unclear but this may be because those people are more likely to come into contact with others and therefore to catch the virus, or they are likely to have poorer health if they are not well paid.  the phe report said: 'for many occupations, however, the number of deaths is too small to draw meaningful conclusions and further analysis will be required.'  public health england data also found that at least 169 care workers and home carers have now died with coronavirus. deaths among those in the care sector were 1.7 times higher during the pandemic compared to previous years and, between march 21 and may 8, there were 548 deaths of all causes among care workers and home carers.  deprivation: poorer people diagnosed more often and more likely to die  the phe report showed that deaths were considerably higher in men in the most deprived communities, and both sexes saw a direct link between deprivation and covid-19 death rate  people who live in the most deprived areas of the country are more likely to get seriously ill or die with the coronavirus, phe's report confirmed.  it said: 'people who live in deprived areas have higher diagnosis rates and death rates than those living in less deprived areas.  'the mortality rates from covid-19 in the most deprived areas were more than double the least deprived areas, for both males and females.  'this is greater than the inequality seen in mortality rates in previous years, indicating greater inequality in death rates from covid-19.  'high diagnosis rates may be due to geographic proximity to infections or a high proportion of workers in occupations that are more likely to be exposed.'  the report explained that higher diagnosis and death rates in poorer communities were still noticeable when people's age and ethnicity were taken into account, but may have been influenced by higher rates of other illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, which phe said 'requires further investigation'."
health,"britain's two-metre social distancing rule is remaining in place, number 10 said today - despite growing pressure on ministers to reduce it.  mps have called for the distance to be loosened in line with other countries such as germany, to save jobs and allow more businesses to reopen.  if pubs, theatres and other hospitality venues have to abide by the two-metre rule, it would severely restrict how many could enter and businesses could go bust.  the prime minister's official spokesman said the matter is 'under review' but added: 'the current guidance is the two-metre rule should remain in place.'  the chartered institute of environmental health (cieh), which represents workers, today argued it is vital the two-metre rule stayed in place to protect staff.  it comes after a major study last night keeping one metre apart can slash the risk of catching coronavirus by 80 per cent.  the world health organization-funded review revealed there is a roughly 1.3 per cent chance of contracting the virus when two metres from an infected patient. but halving this gap raised the risk to only 2.6 per cent.  guidance from who stipulates one-metre social distancing – and britain is one of only a handful of countries going farther.  france, sweden, and austria all follow the un agency’s advice. germany, australia and the netherlands have opted for 1.5 metres.  researchers found there was roughly a 1.3 per cent chance of contracting the virus when two metres from an infected patient. but halving this gap raised the risk to only 2.6 per cent. this means the disease would spread to fewer than three in 100 people, against 13 in 100 without any social distancing at all. that equates to an 80 per cent reduction in risk  politicians and business leaders have claimed the small increased risk from relaxing the two-metre restriction would be worth the economic benefits.  environment secretary theresa villiers called for the distance to be reduced in line with some other countries' rules to save jobs and help the hospitality sector reopen.  miss villiers told bbc radio 4: 'i think we should take comfort from the world health organization that one to two metres is safe.  'and the fact many other countries have taken the approach of one or 1.5 metres, that demonstrates that can be managed safely.'  she added: 'unless we ease the two metre rule, the hospitality sector is likely to stay closed.'  former chancellor norman lamont said halving the rule to one metre was 'the single most important measure we must take' to avoid 'devastating mass unemployment'.  commons science committee greg clark revealed he had written a letter to boris johnson urging the prime minister to relax the two metre rule.  mr clark said: 'the difference between 2m and 1.5m may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs.'  however, on tuesday number 10 said the government believes the two-metre rule should remain in place.  what is the science behind two-metre social distancing rule? the world health organization (who) recommends a one metre distance between two people from separate households. the reason for this, as stated on its website, is that: 'when someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person has the disease.' but other countries have taken advice from their own health experts and social distancing varies from two metres (in the uk) down to one metre (in france) the two metre rule can be traced back to research in the 1930s that showed droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes would land within a one-two metre range. social distancing varies between different countries: two metres: uk, switzerland, us, spain, italy 1.5 metres: germany, poland, netherlands one metre: austria, norway, sweden, finland so, what have the studies shown? one metre number 10's chief scientific adviser - sir patrick vallance - has said that the one metre rule is up to 30 times more risky than the two metre rule. he told mps earlier this month the risk of spending a minute next to a covid-19 patient for two minutes was 'about the same' as being within a metre of a covid-19 case for six seconds. the latest evidence, published in the lancet, found there was roughly a 2.6 per cent chance of catching the virus when one metre from a covid patient. but doubling the gap cut the risk to only 1.3 per cent. two metre one of the top scientific advisers to the british government said the two metre social distancing rule is based on 'very fragile' evidence. professor robert dingwall, a member of nervtag, referred to it as a 'rule of thumb' rather than a scientifically proven measure. other experts have said the distance may be a non-scientific estimate that just caught on in countries around the world. is two metres enough? the uk's coronavirus social distancing limit is four times too short and the gap should be 26 feet, said experts at the massachusetts institute of technology in march. they found viral droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes can travel in a moist, warm atmosphere at speeds of between 33 and 100ft per second. this creates a cloud in the atmosphere that can span approximately 23ft to 27ft (seven metres to eight metres) to neighbouring people, the team said. another study by scientists in cyprus, published a fortnight ago, added to the evidence when it found the two-metre rule may not be far enough. researchers found even in winds of two miles per hour (mph) - the speed needed for smoke to drift - saliva can travel 18 feet in just five seconds. and scientists from the universities of california santa barbara and stanford last week said the two metre rule may have to be trebled when winter strikes. they found droplets that carry sars-cov-2 - the coronavirus that causes covid-19 - can travel up to 20feet (six metres) in cold and humid areas. advertisement  first minister nicola sturgeon has also urged scots to continue to adhere to the current guidance of two metres.  ms sturgeon said today: 'you might be reading or hearing in the media today some voices saying that one metre is sufficient, so i want to take the opportunity today to stress that the clear and the strong advice from the scottish government is to stay two metres apart from those in other households.'  it comes after a new study suggested physical distancing of two metres only reduced the risk of coronavirus transmission by a small amount compared to one metre.    the who found there was roughly a 1.3 per cent chance of contracting the virus when two metres from an infected patient. but halving this gap raised the risk to only 2.6 per cent.  this means the disease would spread to fewer than three in 100 people, against 13 in 100 without any social distancing at all. that equates to an 80 per cent reduction in risk.  the study showed nothing could provide complete protection, although face masks have a strong shielding effect – reducing the risk of catching the virus by up to 85 per cent.  the research, published in medical journal the lancet, added to the clamour for britain's two-metre rule social distancing rule to be relaxed.  previously scientists have said the two-metre rule lacks any validity.  professor robert dingwall, who sits on the government’s scientific advisory body new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, which feeds into sage, said the two metre rule 'has never had much of an evidence base', suggesting it is safe to stand closer to someone.  following the lancet publication, the chartered institute of environmental health (cieh) stressed the 'vital' importance of the two-metre distance as more businesses prepare to open.  the professional body, which represents those who work in environmental health roles such as in the food, housing and transport industries, urged the government to maintain the two-metre guidance especially as 'riskier' businesses including pubs prepare to open.  cieh wales director kate thompson said: 'the world health organisation advice for distances of at least one metre to be maintained, to prevent the spread of coronavirus, has led to strong pressure from certain industries to reduce social distancing between individuals from the current two metres.  'however, this advice was only ever an absolute minimum, rather than a safe distance, and new evidence published today supports this longer distance.  'protecting public health and avoiding the possibility of a second peak of infections should be key. it is, therefore, vital that the two-metre rule is not reduced due to pressure from industry.'  the who study reviewed data from 172 existing studies on the spread of covid-19, sars and mers.  it concluded: 'keeping a distance of over one metre from other people was associated with a much lower risk of infection compared with less than one metre.  'however, the modelling suggests for every extra metre further away up to three metres, the risk of infection or transmission may halve.'  the study also adds to evidence that face masks should be worn on public transport and in busy areas, and highlights the importance of ppe for healthcare workers.  it found that the risk of catching the virus when wearing a mask was just three per cent, compared to 17 per cent when not wearing a mask.  co-author dr derek chu, from mcmaster university, said: 'we believe that solutions should be found for making face masks available to the general public. however, people must be clear that wearing a mask is not an alternative to physical distancing, eye protection or basic measures such as hand hygiene, but might add an extra layer of protection.'  former ministers mr lamont and miss villiers had pointed to the smaller social distancing recommendations in other countries.  figures from the british beer and pub association figures show that, with the current two metre rule, only 20 to 30 per cent of premises will be able to open at a sustainable level.  however, if the rule was reduced to one metre, 70 per cent would be able to open.  mr lamont said: 'the onus is on the (government's) advisers to explain why it is that, while britons must stay two metres apart, the world health organisation recommends one metre - as do many other european countries, acting on their scientists' advice.'  last thursday, prime minister boris johnson reiterated his support for the two metre rule, saying: 'i must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.'"
health,"coronavirus could have been circulating in the uk in early december – almost two months before the first british case was diagnosed, experts have admitted.  china's official submission to the world health organization (who) claims the first coronavirus cases occurred on december 8.  but leaked government data, seen by the south china morning post, suggests the first case was observed almost a month earlier, on november 17.  the first cases on british soil were only identified on january 31, when two chinese nationals in york tested positive for covid-19.  but, with knowledge of the disease's distinctive symptoms, scores of britons now suspect themselves or loved ones were infected well before then.  king's college london academics say hundreds of brits using their symptom tracker app have reported suffering from tell-tale symptoms of the virus at christmas time.  catherine mayer, the widow of gang of four guitarist andy gill, fears her husband was an early victim of the disease when he died of pneumonia in early january.  the musician, 64, had returned from a band trip to china in late november and was struck down with a mystery respiratory illness in december.  his condition quickly deteriorated and he was hospitalised in st thomas' hospital in london with low oxygen levels, a known complication of covid-19.  he died from organ failure after a two-week hospital battle with pneumonia. at around the same time, gill's 26-year-old tour manager was taken to hospital in leeds with a severe lung infection.  dr stephen baker, from cambridge university's infectious diseases institute, said it was 'completely possible' that the virus was imported into the uk in december, if china was obscuring the true date of the first infection.  catherine mayer, the widow of gang of four guitarist andy gill, fears her husband was an early victim of the disease when he died of pneumonia in early january (pictured together  the musician, 64, had returned from a band trip to china in late november and was struck down with a mystery respiratory illness in december  in a blog post written last month, first seen by the guardian, mrs mayer said she emailed gill's doctor to ask whether it could have been the viral disease that killed her husband of 30 years.  'his response winded me,' she wrote. the consultant said: 'it seemed to me at the time of andy's illness that we had not fully understood why he deteriorated as he did.  'once we learned more about covid-19, i thought there was a real possibility that andy had been infected by sars-cov-2.'  it consultant daren bland, 50, from east sussex, believes he was one of the first britons to fall ill with the viral disease in mid-january.  mr bland visited the ischgl ski resort in austria from january 15 to 19, which has now been identified as a breeding ground for the virus after being linked to hundreds of cases identified in denmark, iceland, sweden, austria and germany.  it consultant daren bland, 50, from east sussex, believes he was one of the first britons to fall ill with the viral disease in mid-january after visiting the ischgl ski resort in austria from january 15 to 19  andrew soppitt, a retired hospital consultant from west sussex, is also adamant that he had covid-19 after a similar skiing trip to austria in late january  covid-19 was spreading in uk well before first case was diagnosed, another study finds the coronavirus started spreading in britain before health chiefs managed to find the first two patients in york in january, a study has claimed. researchers in brazil and uruguay studied covid-19 outbreaks in countries around the world to try and work out their true start dates. the first two people to be diagnosed with the disease in the uk were a university of york student and his mother, who was visiting from china at the time. their positive test results were publicly announced on january 30. but the study has suggested the virus started spreading between members of the public on january 29, meaning the two patients had either spread it to other people before falling ill, or they caught it from somebody else who brought the virus into the country. the study suggests britain caught on to its outbreak quickly, however - countries including the us, italy and the netherlands had a gap of two weeks between the start and the first positive test. in brazil, meanwhile, the virus appears to have been spreading for weeks before the rio carnival, which was attended by millions of people in late february, but the first case was only officially recorded on february 26 - the week after. advertisement  the father-of-two thinks he infected his wife sarah and daughters - with his youngest off school for two weeks - who then spread the disease through their neighbourhood ahead of half term.  however, it has not yet been confirmed whether or not mr bland and his family contracted coronavirus because they have not been tested for antibodies - the only way to tell if someone has had the virus in the past.  mr bland told the telegraph: 'we visited the kitzloch [bar] and it was rammed, with people singing and dancing on the tables. people were hot and sweaty from skiing and waiters were delivering shots to tables in their hundreds.  'you couldn't have a better home for a virus. i was ill for 10 days. it was like wading through treacle. i couldn't get up, i couldn't work, it knocked me for six. i was breathless.'  andrew soppitt, a retired hospital consultant from west sussex, is also adamant that he had covid-19 after a similar skiing trip to austria in late january.  the st anton and bad hofgastein resorts that he visited after new year have also been linked to scores of infections in europe.  he said he fell so ill he could not get out of bed and completely lost his sense of taste and smell - a now distinctive symptom of the virus.  the former anaesthetist, who is in his mid-50s, tested positive for antibodies after purchasing a private test - which are not 100 per cent accurate.  he said he was certain that it confirms he had the virus weeks before the first person was officially diagnosed in the uk.  cambridge's dr baker, told the guardian: 'people are on heightened awareness about any sort of respiratory infection and it is easy to retrofit stories to things.  'colds, influenza and even pneumonia are, after all, common in the winter months. let's say it was kicking off fairly substantially in wuhan and people weren't being informed: could there have been people travelling to and from china at that point who may have been infected by coronavirus?  'that is completely possible. is it then possible that they transmitted the virus to other people when they were in the uk? yes, of course that's possible.'  it comes after the covid symptom tracker, designed by scientists at king's college london suggested the disease arrived in the uk in january.  the app asks its 2.6million users to report their symptoms daily, even if they are well, in order to map the disease's spread.  tim spector, professor genetic epidemiology and one of the brains behind the app, said hundreds of contributors have admitted to suffering from covid-like symptoms at around new year.  although the cases are untested, the reports suggest the virus gained a foothold in the uk long before the first case was identified on british soil on january 31.  there were differences in how long it took countries to record their first cases of the coronavirus but the researchers predicted that community outbreaks begun in most affected western countries between mid-january and early february  when community transmission of covid-19 started in different countries, according to a study by researchers in uruguay and brazil who studied outbreaks across the world country community  transmission started first confirmed case first confirmed death china 06-dec 31-dec 09-jan new york 06-feb 01-mar 14-mar italy 15-jan 30-jan 21-feb spain 28-jan 31-jan 13-feb france 22-jan 24-jan 15-feb uk 29-jan 30-jan 05-mar belgium 02-feb 02-feb 11-mar germany 30-jan 27-jan 09-mar netherlands 29-jan 27-feb 06-mar brazil 04-feb 26-feb 17-mar"
health,"there is no evidence britain will be struck by a second wave of covid-19 - despite the widespread fears, according to a leading expert.  professor hugh pennington, an emeritus microbiologist at university of aberdeen, said the notion of a second wave is based on outdated flu models.  scientists have repeatedly referred to the 1918 spanish flu pandemic as a sign the world is heading towards a devastating relapse in cases.  the flu is biologically completely different from the coronavirus and should not be comparable, professor pennington added.  it comes after the government was forced to hit back at claims yesterday that easing the lockdown in england will 'inevitably' lead to a surge in cases.  a sting of experts have warned that re-opening schools and letting as many as six people meet up is a huge gamble.  other scientists - including head the who european region, dr hans kluge - have said the pandemic is far from over and health chiefs should not relax.  it comes after the government was forced to hit back at claims yesterday that easing the lockdown in england will 'inevitably' lead to a surge in cases. pictured: people sunbathing in brighton on may 31, a day before measures were loosened  professor hugh pennington, an emeritus microbiologist, said there is no evidence britain will be struck by a second wave of covid-19  almost all scientists agree the infection is bound to re-emerge in a second wave in the absence of a vaccine or cure for the coronavirus.  the biggest fear is the second wave will occur during the winter and coincide with flu season, which could overwhelm already swamped hospitals.  professor pennington, however, said the evidence to support these claims is 'very weak'.  second 'bump' is more likely than wave, experts say professor hugh pennington, an emeritus microbiologist at university of aberdeen, has said there is no evidence there will be a second wave of the coronavirus, contradictory to the thoughts of others. but he said: 'if we get the easing of lockdown wrong, far more likely would be a continuation of infections, many in the form of localised outbreaks, but not waves or peaks.' writing in the daily telegraph, he said covid-19 tends to cause clusters of cases, which bodes well for the future. he said: 'in new zealand (which may well have eradicated the virus), 41 per cent of cases occurred in 16 clusters of 13 or more cases in each. and, sadly, in the uk the virus has taken an enormous toll on residents of care homes, many of which have had multiple cases.' he noted the only country so far to have got the virus under control and then appeared to have suffered a relapse in cases is singapore. this was related to the coronavirus spreading in a migrant-worker dormitory where control measures were lax. professor mark woolhouse, of edinburgh university, said it is more likely the uk will experience small outbreaks because the r rate of the coronavirus has been squased. at its peak, the reproduction – or r – r number was between two and three, which meant every infected person passed the virus on to two or three others. it is now between 0.7 and 0.9, putting it below the crucial level of one, which is when cases spiral out of control. professor woolhouse, who is part of the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage), told i: 'am i concerned that the r number might creep above one? yes i am. but am i concerned it will go back to where we were at the beginning of the first wave, no i’m not. 'there is no prospect whatsoever that it’s going to go up to two or three again that’s far, far from the reality of what we might reasonably expect. i’m not so much concerned about a second wave, i’m concerned about a second bump. 'the only way that a second wave could happen is if there were a complete collapse in lockdown and everybody just gave up on it despite what the government said – and that’s just not going to happen.' the r number has been guiding government on when to lift lockdown. but the k number will become crucial for fighting a potential second wave, scientists believe. the k number tracks the extent to which new outbreaks are caused by a few 'superspreading events', the sunday times reports. this k measure captures variation in the way a disease is spread. not everyone passes the virus on at the same speed, and not every environment poses a risk to mass transmission. if the k figure is close to one, as with influenza, a virus will move relatively evenly through the population without variation. sars-cov-2 is estimated to have a large variation, which means it doesn't follow a simple pattern. in the case of covid-19, the k is thought to be 0.1 to 0.5 per cent, according to researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. their findings suggest the majority of secondary transmission may be caused by a very small fraction of individuals. in other words, 10 per cent of people are highly infectious, and lead to 80 per cent of transmission. these people may be called 'super spreaders'. the other 90 per cent of individuals don't actually spread it to many other people. they are responsible for the remaining 20 per cent of covid-19 transmission. adam kucharski, an associate professor at lshtm who was involved with the research, said: 'if a handful of events generate most of your outbreak, then if you can find a way of identifying where and when those events are happening then that reduces far more of your transmission than if you were just trying to follow up every case as if they were the same.' advertisement  he made a similar claim in scottish parliament last month, saying he had seen 'no evidence' to suggest a deadlier second wave.  scotland's first minister nicola sturgeon hit back at his claim, warning the science suggests 'there is a very real risk of a second wave'.  asked about professor pennington's comments at a briefing, she added she didn't know what he was basing his claim on.  in a piece for the daily telegraph today, professor pennington admitted that he was a 'second-wave sceptic'.  he noted that the concept of a second wave is based almost entirely on the 1918 spanish flu pandemic, which came in three waves - spring 1918, autumn 1918 and winter 1919.  professor pennington said it is yet to be explained why the virus disappeared before coming back and killing more people.  it may be because the following waves were caused by a genetically different virus. there are no samples from that time to study now.  professor pennington said coronaviruses, such as the new sars-cov-2, cannot be compared to flu because they are so different.  apart from the fact they are spread through coughing and sneezing, there is little to connect them.  the flu has an r rate of seven, meaning one person passes it on to seven others on average. sars-cov-2's is between two and three.  strains of the flu tend to spread relatively evenly among people, but covid-19 has much more variability, scientists say.  it means covid-19 commonly occurs in clusters, such as in care homes. they often can be traced back to one 'super spreader' person or event.  outbreaks in the future, therefore, will probably be localised instead, professor pennington wrote.  'defeatist flu models still lurk behind current covid-19 predictions,' professor pennington, ex-president of the society for general microbiology, said.  'that the virus will persist for ages is a flu concept. these predictions should be put to one side.  'like sars, and unlike flu, the virus is eradicable. if china and new zealand are striving to be free of it, we should be, too.'  professor pennington's view that the virus is 'eradicable' is in stark contrast to the beliefs of other experts.  dr andrea ammon, the eu's boss on disease control, has warned the virus is not going away any time soon because it is 'very well adapted to humans'.  she has urged europe to prepare for another crisis, which she said was inevitable because so few people will have developed covid-19 immunity.  in an interview with the guardian on may 21 she said: 'the question is when and how big, that is the question in my view.'  dr hans kluge, director for the who european region, said he was 'very concerned' a surge in infections would coincide with other seasonal diseases such as the flu.  speaking exclusively to the telegraph in mid-may, he cautioned that now is the time for 'preparation, not celebration' across europe - even if countries are show positive signs of recovery.  figures show dwindling outbreaks across europe. yesterday spain reported no new deaths, a huge milestone in their fight against the coronavirus.  experts have warned against slacking virus defences now, however.  it's been a three and a half weeks since prime minister boris johnson triggered the first steps out of lockdown, which included an allowance on unlimited exercise and travelling to other parts of england.  any repercussions of the move would not become apparent until a few weeks later.  mr johnson went one step further to re-open schools from june 1 - against teaching unions' wishes - and allow outdoor markets to start selling again.  a series of experts have raised concern about the move to ease lockdown from westminster - which has not been replicated in scotland or wales.  professor devi sridhar, who has been advising the scottish government, warned it looks 'inevitable' that cases will rise again in england.  'i'm very sorry to say that i think it is right now inevitable looking at the numbers,' she told sky news.  'if your objective is to contain the virus, to drive numbers down and to try to in a sense get rid of it so no-one is exposed to it, then it is not the right measure right now to open up.  'it's a big risk and gamble for exiting lockdown with a larger number of deaths than we did when we actually entered lockdown months back.'  from the early days of the covid-19 outbreak, scientists have been haunted by the example of the 1918 spanish flu pandemic - which is estimated to have killed 50million  overall, more people died from spanish influenza than the number of people who died in the first world war  professor john edmunds, an epidemiologist at the school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said the prime minister had 'clearly made a political decision' because the threat of a second peak remains high.  two other sage experts lined up behind professor edmunds on saturday to caution that measures were being relaxed when the infection rate was still not low enough.  professor peter openshaw, who sits on the the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (nervtag) to the government, said people must proceed with 'great caution' as the lockdown is eased.  he told the bbc's andrew marr programme: 'at the moment, we still have quite a large number of cases out there in the community and i think unlocking too fast carries a great risk that all the good work that's been put in by everyone, to try to reduce transmission may be lost.'  former world health organisation director professor anthony costello has predicted a resurgence of the virus without adequate contact tracing.  in a scathing tweet on saturday, professor costello said: 'we have 8,000 cases daily, a private testing system set up without connection to primary care, call-centre tracing that appears a fiasco, and no digital app. after 4 months. unless the population has hidden (t cell?) immunity, we're heading for resurgence.'  from the early days of the covid-19 outbreak, scientists have been haunted by the example of the 1918 spanish flu pandemic - which is estimated to have killed 50million.  the first wave of the virus was particularly deadly to the older generations and the vulnerable - much like what the world is currently experiencing with covid-19.  the second wave, which came in autumn of the same year after cases had dwindled, is believed to have been even deadlier than the first.  the virus is thought to have mutated to a more life-threatening form and this time the virus began to affect young people.  it reappeared again in australia for the third wave the following winter before again spreading across the world. although it was not as severe as the second wave it was still more deadly than the first.  another minor wave took a hold in spring 1920, affecting isolated areas such as new york city, as well as the uk and some south american islands, but compared to the previous waves the mortality rate was low.  overall, more people died from spanish influenza than the number of people who died in the first world war.  when setting out future plans the uk government and public health england has taken into account the lessons learned during the spanish flu pandemic but views it as an example of the 'reasonable worst case scenario'."
health,"nearly half of britons have admitted they are drinking earlier in the day, twice as high as nations at the other end of the spectrum.  a survey of 40,000 people across the world revealed britain tops the table among 12 countries on a number of drinking parameters.  nearly 47 per cent of people who drink reported starting earlier in the day than usual during the pandemic, compared with 23 per cent in greece.  britons say that the unprecedented lockdown - imposed on march 23 - has triggered boredom and anxiety that has left them reaching for the bottle.  more than half said they had increased the number of days they drink on and a third revealed they were binge-drinking more often.  despite pubs being closed, off-licences have stayed open and the stockpiling panic in the early days of the crisis saw supermarket shelves swiped of alcohol.  those who have managed to cut back on their drink - around a quarter - said they had more money and better physical and mental health for it.  the survey findings come after official statistics showed the amount of alcohol sold jumped by almost 34 per cent over march and april.  nearly half of britons admit they are drinking earlier in the day, twice as high as nations at the other end of the spectrum - greece, germany and switzerland - a survey has revealed  the findings come from the global drug survey and give an insight into the coping mechanisms people have adopted during the covid-19 crisis.  it found 31 per cent of people globally are drinking earlier in the day, which jumps up to 47 per cent in the uk.  some 30 per cent have increased their drinking days 'a little', (35 per cent in the uk), and 13 per cent have increased it 'a lot' (20.6 per cent in the uk).  a quarter of global respondents said the number of days they drank had decreased during covid-19, while 29 per cent had seen no change.  when asked how often they were binge drinking - at least five drinks, such as a bottle of beer or glass of wine, in one session - a quarter said this was occuring more often than in february. but 30 per cent said this was happening less often.  overall, 11 per cent of people surveyed said they had drunk every single day in the past month. this was not broken down into countries.  the uk places in the top three countries for every drinking measure out of the 12 countries who have participated so far.  countries who are on the lower end of the scale - with less dramatic increases in drinking habits - include greece, germany and switzerland.  a closer look at the uk's statistics show that of 1,100 survey respondents, a third are binge-drinking more often, which is higher than the average.  some 35 per cent are drinking on more days of the week than usual, while 20 per cent are drinking on a lot more days.  four in ten people said their physical and mental health had suffered as a result, which is higher than the global figure.  but the same amount said it was their anxiety that had them drinking more alcohol in the first place, almost double the 25 per cent globally, alongside boredom and too much time.  'the survey shows that what you do matters. in a short perio­­­d, people are feeling worse off mentally and physically through drinking,' professor adam winstock, a consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist and founder and director of the survey, told the guardian.  'and we see the real significant benefits of drinking less. this is not about being sober and not getting tipsy. just drop a day or two to see a difference.'  professor winstock told vice social media had largely normalised heavy drinking during lockdown, but that 'you don't have to follow the herd'.  in the uk, more than half said they had increased their drinking days  percentage of people who have increase their binge drinking (five drinks or more) either a little or a lot: some 30 per cent have increased their drinking days 'a little', (35 per cent in the uk), and 13 per cent have increased it 'a lot' (20.6 per cent in the uk)  half of britons have gained weight during pandemic half of britons admit they have piled on the pounds during lockdown – putting them more at risk of coronavirus. a study by king's college london also found 41 per cent of adults did not leave their home on five of the previous seven days leading up to this latest survey and 46 per cent of parents say the same applied to their children. the worrying finding comes after nhs data revealed severely overweight people are more likely to die from covid-19. the survey of more than 2,250 people in england, wales and scotland between may 20 and may 22 also revealed a third of people have consumed more alcohol than they normally would, up from 19 per cent in early april. tam fry, chairman of the national obesity forum, told mailonline: 'the fact that so many people admit to putting on weight should surprise no one. this will be substantially more obesity due to comfort eating and snacking than the regrettable lack of exercise. 'when covid-19 is over and the true effect on britain's waistlines is reported expect draconian health measures. boris johnson has vowed to launch a war on fat through fear of a second wave but he won't win it if the measures required are not immediately implemented.' four in 10 said they felt more lonely than usual, while 35 per cent have postponed seeking medical advice or treatment unrelated to covid-19. a vthird of the country has halted their nhs treatment due to fears about catching the virus in hospital or being a burden on the health service. advertisement  almost 28 per cent of respondents said they were drinking on less days, while almost 36 per cent were binge drinking less often. their finances had been boosted as a result, two-thirds said, and their physical health had improved.  overall, 42 per cent of participants said they would like to drink less in the next 30 days, and the researchers pointed to their free, anonymous app the drinks meter for guidance on how to do so.  the report comes the same day that research from king's college london, conducted in may, reports nearly a third of people in the uk (29 per cent) are drinking more than they typically would.  that's an increase on the 19 per cent reported in april, according to interviews with more than 2,250 adults, by the policy institute at king’s in partnership with ipsos mori.  professor colin drummond, who led the research, said: 'alcohol consumption and mental health are intimately linked. an increase in isolation, mental distress, depression and anxiety is likely to have been a factor driving increased alcohol consumption during the covid-19 pandemic.'  another survey from alcohol change uk found one in five british adults - around 8.6million - who drink alcohol are drinking more frequently since lockdown.  more than one in three of the 1,555 drinkers said they have either stopped drinking or reduced how often they drink since march. six per cent have stopped drinking entirely.  ian hamilton, an associate professor of addiction at university of york, said recent surveys show those who were already drinkers have seen their habits worsen.  he told mailonline: 'essentially there are two distinct groups emerging; the first were drinking low amounts or were abstinent prior to covid and during covid have reduced their drinking further or continued being abstinent. the second group who were drinking at hazardous levels prior to covid are now consuming even more alcohol.  'this shouldn't be a surprise as retail sales of alcohol have risen and people are isolated and bored, two factors that we know increase alcohol intake.'  sales of alcohol have soared by 33.7 per cent since the lockdown, according to the office for national statistics.  the march retail report showed a spike of 31.4 per cent in purchasing of alcohol, likely a result of stockpiling, while sales increased by a smaller 2.3 per cent in april.  some 12,000 people responded to the questions in the global drug survey about cannabis use, with 40.9 per cent reporting increased use of thc containing products - which are those that get you high.  the uk has seen the second highest jump (23 per cent) after australia (26 per cent). once again, the most common reasons included excess time.  the report said: 'for drugs like cannabis that many people use regularly regardless of social context. having more time on your hands and being bored appears to be the main reason, with secondary factors including addressing mood and worries.'  mdma and cocaine use has dramatically reduced, with 40 per cent saying they had consumed less during the pandemic, mainly because they were not seeing friends they do it with.  the uk was among the top countries to have cut back (37 per cent), despite london being dubbed the 'cocaine capital' of europe.  in this survey, 39 per cent said they had taken cocaine in the past year, the second largest amount just behind the netherlands, and 34 per cent mdma.  the majority of participants of this survey were young, experienced with the use of illicit drugs, and employed or in education  globally, around 35 per cent of participants who take anxiety curbing benzodiazepines, also known as benzos, reported increased useage during the pandemic.  'increases in benzodiazepine use can be viewed as a coping strategy and their use may compensate for access to other drugs,' the report said.  it warned misuse and dependence of benzos are a real concern, especially because withdrawal can be potentially life threatening."
health,"the number of deaths among people with severe learning disabilities more than doubled in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, damning statistics show.  the care quality commission, which regulates services caring for people with disabilities in england, found that 386 people died between april 10 and may 15.  this was 134 per cent higher than the same period last year, when the total was 165.  almost all of the extra deaths were accounted for by the coronavirus - some 206 of those people died with confirmed or suspected covid-19.  charity bosses representing the sector said the statistics were 'deeply troubling' and a 'stark reminder' that disabled people's health rights were falling by the wayside.  the data was published today for the first time, almost three months since the first brit was killed by the coronavirus.  more people with learning disabilities have died of covid-19 during the five-week period from april 10 than died in total in that same period last year (206 compared to 165)  the care quality commission, which regulates services caring for people with disabilities in england, found that 386 people died between april 10 and may 15. this was 134 per cent higher than the same period last year, when the total was 165  this took 'too long', critics said, and still only shows a partial picture. they have called for more widespread testing of people with disabilities, who are more likely to die of lung infections than the general population.  'the devastating impact of covid-19 on our community is shocking, but sadly not surprising,' said edel harris, chief executive of the charity mencap.  mencap supports people living with learning disabilities such as autism, down's syndrome and williams syndrome.  ms harris said: 'we have long been warning that the healthcare rights of people with a learning disability are under threat like never before.  'throughout this crisis, we have repeatedly challenged discriminatory healthcare guidance and practice, and we continue to support people with a learning disability and their families to access the treatment and support they have a right to.'  dan scorer, the head of policy at mencap, said on radio 4 this morning that the data was still missing the peak of the outbreak and its early days, meaning it only shows a partial picture.  he told the today programme the data was 'extremely worrying' and said: 'i think it makes it even more extraordinary that people in care homes people with learning disability can't don't have access to testing.  'that's only available for older people and people with dementia. so that needs to change urgently. the government needs to change the criteria for covid testing  'the government has understandably had a very strong focus on social care and old people in social care but... remember that half of the social care budget is spent on disabled adults of working age.  'yet they've been largely forgotten from the discussion around supporting people in care homes, supporting people who receive social care in the community.'  people with learning disabilities more likely to die with lung infections lung infections and breathing problems are the leading cause of death among people with learning disabilities, according to officials. people with learning disabilities include those with conditions like autism, down's syndrome and williams syndrome, as well as others who have severe brain damage or developmental delays. the scottish government said in a report in 2013: 'respiratory [lung] disease is the leading cause of death for people with learning disabilities and is responsible for around half of all deaths among people with learning disabilities; these rates are much higher than for the general population. 'pneumonia and aspiration [inhaling fluid] are more common which may be linked to the prevalence of swallowing and eating problems and gastro-intestinal disease amongst people who have profound and multiple needs.' the report explains that poor oral health and the presence of bacteria in people's mouths may contribute to this increased risk of lung infections. people with some learning disabilities may also have difficulty swallowing - a symptom called dysphagia - which can contribute to the risk of infection. many of the muscles involved in swallowing are also key for healthy breathing - and strong breathing control helps to prevent infection by expelling bacteria or viruses by coughing, and stopping people from inhaling substances or fluids which might interfere with their lungs. advertisement  working with the office for national statistics (ons), the cqc analysed all death notifications from registered providers providing care to people with a learning disability and/or autism in the community and in hospitals.  of those who died, 184 were receiving care from social care services in the community, meaning they were living in private homes but had support from carers.  while 195 of the victims lived in residential social care - specialist care homes, for example.  there were fewer than five deaths notified in each of the other settings, including community health, hospice services and mental health services, the cqc said.  the regulator said the government should consider widening the availability of testing for people with learning disabilities, who are particularly vulnerable.  chief inspector of adult social care at the cqc, kate terroni, said: 'every death in today's figures represents an individual tragedy for those who have lost a loved one.  'while we know this data has its limitations, what it does show is a significant increase in deaths of people with a learning disability as a result of covid-19.  'we already know that people with a learning disability are at an increased risk of respiratory illnesses, meaning that access to testing could be key to reducing infection and saving lives.  'these figures also show that the impact on this group of people is being felt at a younger age range than in the wider population - something that should be considered in decisions on testing of people of working age with a learning disability.'  the cqc said it is not mandatory for providers to tell them if a person who has died has a learning disability.  its analysis does not account for patients detained under the mental health act - also known as being 'sectioned'.  public health england (phe) said it was looking at the impact of covid-19 on individuals with learning disabilities and would publish its findings.  dr rhidian hughes, chief executive of the voluntary organisations disability group (vodg) welcomed the analysis but said it had taken the cqc 'too long' to produce it.  he said: 'these findings are a sad and stark reminder to us all of the impact that coronavirus is having on people with a learning disability and/or autism.  'the figures are a wake-up call for government to put right its testing programme that is currently neglecting disabled people of working age who use care services.  'the current focus of the testing programme is on older people in care homes with a diagnosis of a dementia.  'that decision needs to be reviewed urgently so that symptomatic and asymptomatic disabled people can readily access tests.'  a department of health and social care spokesman said: 'every death from this virus is a tragedy and we are working hard to save lives and protect people most in need of support.  'we have significantly increased testing capacity so everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can be tested, and have already carried out more than four million tests.  'we are working to improve our understanding of how different groups may be affected by the virus, including those with learning disabilities or autism, to ensure we can provide the best support and protect those most at risk.'"
health,"nicknamed the 'antibody superman', dr alessandro giardini spent seven days on a ventilator, battling coronavirus — but now his blood could save the lives of others critically ill with covid-19.  dr giardini, a paediatrician at great ormond street hospital, is one of more than 2,000 britons who have recovered from covid-19 and donated their plasma as a potential treatment against the disease. he is now urging others who have survived covid-19 to do the same.  plasma is the fluid that makes up about half of our blood's volume. it carries red and white blood cells and platelets (tiny cells that help form clots to stop bleeding) around the body.  superhero: our mock up of dr alessandro giardini. he spent seven days on a ventilator, battling coronavirus, now his blood could save the lives of others critically ill with covid-19  after we've had a virus, our plasma contains antibodies that our body made to fight it off. so the hope is that giving antibody-rich plasma from a recovered covid-19 patient to someone still infected will help them recover, too.  'while a drug or vaccine can take years, even decades, to develop, plasma therapy is almost instantly available,' says dr colin hamilton-davies, a consultant in anaesthesia and critical care at bart's hospital in london.  small studies on coronavirus patients in china and the u.s. have yielded promising results. now nhs blood and transplant (nhsbt) is collecting plasma from thousands of corona survivors for use in two large trials under way in uk hospitals.  the plasma is taken about four weeks after patients' last symptoms, when antibody levels should be at their peak.  covid patients are given two units (almost a pint) of plasma over two consecutive days. each unit comes from a different donor, to help even out differences in the donors' levels. that's because analysis of plasma samples already collected shows some people produce higher levels of antibodies against coronavirus than others.  recovered coronavirus patient adam drew donating convalescent plasma by plasmapheresis at tooting blood donor centre, london  dr giardini has more of these antibodies than anyone else in the uk whose plasma has been tested so far (more than 400 people). his levels are 40 times higher than those of the typical donor.  antibody levels are described as a fraction — the bigger the bottom number, the higher the number of antibodies. a level of one in 100 is the threshold being used in the covid-19 plasma trials; it means antibodies are still active against coronavirus even when the plasma is diluted to 100th of its usual strength.  dr giardini's result was one in 2,560 — his plasma was so packed with antibodies, it could still fight off the virus when diluted more than 2,500 times.  only a third of plasma donated has levels judged high enough to fight the infection and hence fit to be used to treat patients (the rest will be stored in case it can usefully be used in future).  so what makes patients such as dr giardini antibody super- donors? well, it's not about having a strong immune system — in fact, those who fight off the infection quickly are less likely to develop antibodies. rather, it seems to be an upside to becoming critically ill with covid-19, then coming through it: the more ill you are, the more antibodies you will produce.  recent nhsbt data shows plasma donors who are male, or aged over 35, or have been treated in hospital, are most likely to have antibody levels high enough for use in transfusion.  the reason is simple: antibody levels increase over time, so people who have been seriously ill make more — and coronavirus hits men and older people harder. and those who need to be admitted to hospital will generally have been sicker than those who recovered at home.  as a man in his mid-40s who spent 15 days in hospital, dr giardini, a father of two, ticked all three boxes. the 46-year-old says he is proud to have donated his plasma as 'a gift for others'.  he may also have genes that boost antibody production, says david roberts, a professor of haematology at the university of oxford and an associate medical director at nhsbt.  the existence of such genes means someone who doesn't fit any of the standard criteria may also have made enough antibodies for their plasma to be used in transfusions. but there is no easy way to know how many antibodies you produce — you must donate plasma to find out.  nhsbt is appealing for more donors for the plasma trials is it co-ordinating. anyone aged between 17 and 66 who has had coronavirus, including suspected cases who were not tested, can volunteer.  donating two units of plasma takes about 45 minutes. the donor's blood is piped through a machine that separates out the plasma, then returns the rest of the blood to the donor.  the plasma's antibody levels are checked and it is screened for other infections before being infused into a covid-19 patient.  donors with very high levels of antibodies will be asked to give plasma up to once a fortnight and for longer. dr giardini is already booked to make a second donation.  one of the trials, remap-cap, will compare about 1,000 intensive care patients in up to 80 uk hospitals given plasma therapy with a similar number who are cared for as usual.  the second study, the university of oxford-led recovery trial, will involve 5,000 patients in almost 200 hospitals who are not in intensive care.  results are expected late this summer and if the treatment is proved to be safe and effective, it could rapidly be used in hospitals around the country.  'treating 1,000 patients a week would be fantastic,' says professor roberts. 'plasma is readily available, collected easily and given easily. it is a way people who have been ill themselves can contribute directly to helping others and saving lives.'  find out how to donate here: www.nhsbt.nhs.uk"
health,"advertisement  the uk coronavirus death toll rose by more than 400 yesterday as results of historic tests on people who died earlier in the pandemic came back positive and were added en masse, officials said.  the department for health said 111 people died on sunday, but the death total rose in all by 556 as the 445 extra fatalities appeared in figures for the first time.  these additional deaths are linked to cases that have been identified through testing that has been carried out by commercial partners, rather than testing that has been done in nhs and public health england laboratories.  meanwhile number 10 hit back at warnings from experts that easing the lockdown will cause a further spike in covid-19 cases, claiming the crucial coronavirus r-rate will stay below one if brits continue to adhere to the strict social distancing guidelines designed to halt the outbreak.  downing street said the scientific consensus is that it is 'unlikely' that the relaxation of guidelines in england will push the r rate - the number of people an infected patient passes the virus on to - past one, despite it already being between 0.7 and 0.9 and dangerously close to the threshold.  tories and top scientists have voiced alarm about the consequences of the tweaks in england - which include six people from different households being able to meet up in public places or gardens, primary schools starting to return, and more shops opening.  it comes as health chiefs today announced 111 more britons died after testing positive for coronavirus - the lowest daily toll since boris johnson imposed the lockdown on march 23. but death numbers released on sundays and mondays are always significantly smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend.  it comes as separate figures revealed yesterday - the first day of england's lockdown being eased - that almost half of nhs hospital trusts in england have reported no new fatalities in the past 48 hours. two experts who analysed the statistics also revealed 12 trusts in england (9.2 per cent) have recorded no coronavirus deaths in the past week.  in yesterday's downing street press conference, health secretary matt hancock also revealed 1,570 more brits have tested positive for the infection - the lowest number since the end of march. and he presented data that showed 479 patients were admitted to hospital with england on may 30, down 20 per cent in a week.  beaches and parks were swamped yesterday, with thousands of brits taking advantage of the scorching weather on the first day of lockdown being eased since the draconian measures were introduced 10 weeks ago. local public health directors today revealed they fear ministers have lifted too many restrictions, too quickly.  hitting back at the claims, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'we have worked to gradually and safely ease the lockdown measures, the consensus from the scientists is if test and trace is up and running and the public follow the social distancing guidance then it's unlikely the measures will push the r above one.'  in other developments to britain's coronavirus crisis yesterday:  some of the 2million pupils returning to primary school were turned away because headteachers 'weren't ready' for them;  britons were allowed to meet their friends for socially distant fun and games for the first time since march 23, with the easing of lockdown rules;  number 10 admitted the coronavirus alert level has still not been lowered, despite lockdown rules being eased in england;  ikea shoppers at one store formed a giant three hour queue as the diy furniture giant reopened 19 furniture sites across england;  nhs covid-19 contact tracers said the system is 'obviously not ready' and admitted they have nothing to do all day - despite being paid up to £27-an-hour;  the government's plan to allow more than 2million vulnerable people outside lacks any scientific rationale and amounts to a pr stunt, an expert warned.  scientists who analysed the statistics revealed 12 nhs hospital trusts in england (9.2 per cent) have recorded no coronavirus deaths in the past week, as well as 65 (49.6 per cent) who have registered none in the past 48 hours  where are the 65 trusts that have recorded no deaths in the last 48 hours? airedale nhs foundation trust  alder hey children's nhs foundation trust  ashford and st peter's hospitals nhs foundation trust  birmingham community healthcare nhs foundation trust  bolton nhs foundation trust  cambridge university hospitals nhs foundation trust  chelsea and westminster hospital nhs foundation trust  dartford and gravesham nhs trust  doncaster and bassetlaw teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust  dorset county hospital nhs foundation trust  east cheshire nhs trust  east lancashire hospitals nhs trust  east sussex healthcare nhs trust  frimley health nhs foundation trust  gateshead health nhs foundation trust  george eliot hospital nhs trust  gloucestershire hospitals nhs foundation trust  guy's and st thomas' nhs foundation trust  harrogate and district nhs foundation trust  homerton university hospital nhs foundation trust  imperial college healthcare nhs trust  isle of wight nhs trust  james paget university hospitals nhs foundation trust  medway nhs foundation trust  milton keynes university hospital nhs foundation trust  norfolk and norwich university hospitals nhs foundation trust  norfolk and suffolk nhs foundation trust  north bristol nhs trust  north cumbria integrated care nhs foundation trust  north middlesex university hospital nhs trust  northern devon healthcare nhs trust  oxford university hospitals nhs foundation trust  poole hospital nhs foundation trust  portsmouth hospitals nhs trust  royal cornwall hospitals nhs trust  royal devon and exeter nhs foundation trust  royal free london nhs foundation trust  royal surrey county hospital nhs foundation trust  royal united hospitals bath nhs foundation trust  salford royal nhs foundation trust  sandwell and west birmingham hospitals nhs trust  south tees hospitals nhs foundation trust  south warwickshire nhs foundation trust  southport and ormskirk hospital nhs trust  st george's university hospitals nhs foundation trust  st helens and knowsley teaching hospitals nhs trust  taunton and somerset nhs foundation trust  the dudley group nhs foundation trust  the hillingdon hospitals nhs foundation trust  the princess alexandra hospital nhs trust  the queen elizabeth hospital, king's lynn, nhs foundation trust  the royal bournemouth and christchurch hospitals nhs foundation trust  the royal wolverhampton nhs trust  torbay and south devon nhs foundation trust  university hospital southampton nhs foundation trust  university hospitals coventry and warwickshire nhs trust  university hospitals of leicester nhs trust  university hospitals plymouth nhs trust  west suffolk nhs foundation trust  weston area health nhs trust  whittington health nhs trust  worcestershire acute hospitals nhs trust  wye valley nhs trust  yeovil district hospital nhs foundation trust advertisement  the reproduction rate -

before the lockdown loosened. government advisers last week claimed the r range had dropped to 0.7-0.9, down from 0.7-1.  number 10's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance warned that the numbers are 'not coming down fast' in a downbeat update at friday's downing street press conference, and said the rate may be 'very close' to one in some areas.  the uk's deaths include 96 in england, nine in scotland, five in wales and one in northern ireland. yesterday officials announced 113 more covid-19 deaths, which was also the lowest daily toll since lockdown began on march 23 (74).  individual authorities have different cut-off points for records to be submitted, meaning the tallies added up for england, scotland, wales and northern ireland often don't match the final breakdown given by the dh.  nhs england recorded 108 more patients had died in hospitals. wales posted five new deaths across all settings, while scotland and northern ireland registered one each.  processes for recording people's deaths are known for slowing down and even stopping at the weekends and on bank holidays, meaning there is a dip every monday - or tuesday if it follows a bank holiday - followed by surges on tuesdays and wednesdays.  it comes as two experts today crunched the numbers reported by nhs england, and found that almost half of trusts - 65, or 49.6 per cent - have recorded no deaths in the past 48 hours.  professor carl heneghan and dr jason oke, from the centre for evidence-based medicine at oxford university, said: 'today’s reported figure is 108 deaths in hospitals in england: 79 (73 per cent) of these were in the last week.'  and they added that 12 trusts had registered no covid-19 deaths in the past week.  these were: alder hey children's nhs foundation trust (ft), gateshead health nhs ft, norfolk and suffolk nhs ft, north cumbria integrated care nhs ft, north middlesex university hospital nhs trust, oxford university hospitals nhs ft, poole hospital nhs ft, royal devon and exeter nhs ft, taunton and somerset nhs ft, the hillingdon hospitals nhs ft, weston area health nhs trust and whittington health nhs trust.  for comparison, that rate has barely changed since the academics began to analyse the figures on may 21. and the number of trusts not recording a death for 48 hours is the second-highest since the data collection began, down from 52.7 per cent yesterday.  restrictions across the country lifted today as outdoor markets reopened along with car showrooms. horse racing also resumed at newcastle racecourse but there will be no spectators present at the venue as mass gatherings remain banned. and vulnerable people who have until now been advised to stay indoors due to the coronavirus pandemic will be permitted to go outside.  it comes as up to two million pupils were due to return to primary school today. but it was revealed this morning that some were turned away because headteachers 'weren't ready' for them.  up to 1,500 primary schools in england are estimated to be defying the government's controversial plan to get all reception, year 1 and year 6 children back in the classroom from june 1.  teachers have admitted they were 'anxious' to work and unions demanded the date be pushed back to june 15 at the earliest, amid fears the virus is still spreading at high levels.  parents have revealed many schools will remain closed for at least another week or more, while some have not yet set a date at all.  at least two dozen councils have refused to reopen their schools or left it up to headteachers, who are trying to find ways to ensure social distancing and have enough teachers to teach 'bubbles' of up to ten children.  mailonline revealed there was confusion at several schools across london, with some parents arriving with their children only to be informed they couldn't come in and had to go home again.  in other developments, ministers are desperately trying to quell a backlash over easing lockdown today despite the coronavirus alert level not having been reduced.  with beaches and parks again swamped as people take advantage of scorching weather, business secretary alok sharma was forced to deny there is a 'dash' to get the country back up and running.  he insisted the new contact tracing system means measures can be tightened again in specific areas if there is a flare up.  but downing street was forced to admit the alert level has still not been reduced from level four to three, even though the guidance suggested easing of lockdown is not possible until it was reduced.  tories and top scientists have voiced alarm about the consequences of the tweaks in england - which include six people from different households being able to meet up in public places or gardens.  there are concerns it will be impossible to put the 'genie back in the bottle' if cases increase, with one mp telling mailonline the government had gone from 'baby steps to giant steps' with nothing in between.  in tonight's downing street press conference, health secretary matt hancock (pictured alongside testing coordinator professor john newton) also revealed 1,570 more brits have tested positive for the infection - the lowest number since the end of march  the government has frantically urged britons to act 'sensibly' as they enjoy a host of new freedoms, following crowded scenes across the country yesterday before the overhaul officially came into force.  it came as ikea stores across britain today were seeing giant queues form outside, with customers forming three-hour queues as lockdown restrictions were eased.  the car park at ikea in wembley, north london, which was until recently a coronavirus test centre, was full of cars this morning as the store opened for business for the first time since the lockdown was imposed.  is covid-19 becoming less potent? doctors in italy claim the coronavirus has weakened and become a shadow of the disease that rapidly spread around the world. italian medics say the infection - which has killed 370,000 worldwide - is much less lethal than it was and 'no longer clinically exists'. patients are showing much smaller amounts of the virus in their system, compared to samples taken during the peak of the crisis in march and april, they said. infections and deaths caused by covid-19 have been falling in italy for weeks. it was, at one point, the centre of europe's escalating outbreak. scientific theory suggests viruses may become weaker over time in a bid to survive - if they kill or cripple all their human hosts they will run out of road. but virologists have today cast doubt on the italian doctors' claims, saying there is no evidence the virus is losing potency anywhere. one called them 'bulls***'. viruses known to have mutated in this way, such as hiv and the common cold, have been around for decades and thousands of years, respectively, while the coronavirus was only spotted in humans in december last year. another scientist said it was possible that the coronavirus would mutate in this way but it was dangerous to assume it was happening simply from swab samples.  aerial photos show hundreds of customers queuing around the block in the stifling heat to get into the shops in nottingham, reading and essex, as the government urged the country to act 'sensibly' amid restrictions being eased.  massive lines of people could also be seen snaking around the car parks at the swedish furniture giant's branches in wednesbury, west midlands.  some eager shoppers had been queuing from as early as 5.30am - over four hours before the store was due to open at 10am today.  huge traffic jams were also reported in and around the areas as people flocked to their local branch following boris johnson's further easing of lockdown restrictions.  it comes after doctors in italy today claimed the coronavirus has weakened and become a shadow of the disease that rapidly spread around the world.  italian medics say the infection -

'if you no longer want to remain outdoors, you should go home.  'don’t go into garages, sheds or cabins – these are all indoor areas and where the risk of transmission is higher.'  can we have a barbecue and how will it work?  eople should not pass food or drinks to those not within their family groups and you should bring your own plates and utensils  barbecues and other al fresco eating like picnics are allowed, but with strict measures in place to avoid contamination.  you should bring your own garden chairs if possible, and if you cannot thoroughly clean the ones you sit on.  the advice is to 'stay alert'. people should not pass food or drinks to those not within their family groups and you should bring your own plates and utensils. and you should wash your hands frequently.  and in bad news for the hosts, it adds: 'if you are in someone else’s garden, you must not go inside to help the host carry the food out or to help with the washing up.'  what else can we do? can we get the paddling pool out for the kids?  paddling pools should not be shared by people who are not within the same family group. and the bad news extends to the mega rich who have swimming pools, the rules are the same for them.  i don't have a garden, can we all meet up somewhere else?  he rules allow separate family groups to travel to another location, as long as there is no overnight stay involved - so camping and weekends away are still banned  yes, the rules allow separate family groups to travel to another location, as long as there is no overnight stay involved - so camping and weekends away are still banned.  the guidance states: 'you can travel to outdoor open space irrespective of distance, as long as you can return the same night and do not put others at risk because of services you may need in the time you are away.'  this includes 'national parks or beaches' although it warns that some remain clised - like durdle door in dorset which was swamped with people at the weekend.  it also recommends you avoid public transport where possible, suggesting cycling or walking where possible.  so no overnight trips allowed?  not for leisure, no. holidays and visits to a second home are not allowed. the only exception is work travel.  the guidance states: 'premises such as hotels and bed and breakfasts will remain closed, except where providing accommodation for specific reasons set out in law, such as for critical workers where required for a reason relating to their work.  'hotels are also available to host those self-isolating after arriving in the uk (where no other accommodation is available).'  but i don't live with my partner, and i haven't seen them in months...  bad luck. the rules clearly state that conjugal visits are not allowed. in one of the more controversial moves, boris johnson's government has brought in a sex ban.  the guidance states: 'close contact with people from other households means a much higher risk of transmission, and according to the scientific advice, we cannot safely allow people to see people they don’t live with indoors without the risk that the virus will spread.  'we recognise how difficult this is for people – particularly those who live alone and we are keeping this under constant review.'  the rules created a lot of amusement - or horror - on social media, with legal blogger and writer the secret barrister pointing out (above) the guidance only applied to sex indoors.  but there is some confusion over how well the rule can be enforced.  downing street helpfully confirmed today that police will not be allowed to enter the homes of people they suspect are breaching the rule, with the prime minister's spokesman saying: 'the police will do as they have since the beginning of the health regulations being in place, by exercising their common sense and engaging with the public and only issuing fixed penalty notices when they believe it's a last resort.  'the police do not have the power to enter people's homes under the regulations ... they cannot enter your home unless they expect serious criminal activity is taking place there'.  can i take my mind off this with sports?  solo sports like tennis and golf are allowed in groups of up to six, with social distancing maintained and no sharing of equipment  the rules could also be seen to apply to other spots like kayaking or paddle-boarding where people keep their distance  yes, sports are permitted under the same gathering rules.  solo sports like tennis and golf are allowed in groups of up to six, with social distancing maintained and no sharing of equipment.  this includes doubles tennis 'as long as you remain two metres apart as far as possible'.  and training for team sports like football, rugby and hockey are also allowed.  the guidance notes: 'people who play team sports can meet to train together and do things like conditioning or fitness sessions but they must be in separate groups of no more than six and must be two metres apart at all times.  'while groups could practice ball skills like passing and kicking, equipment sharing should be kept to a minimum and strong hand hygiene practices should be in place before and after."
health,"advertisement  boris johnson's hopes of downgrading the coronavirus alert level from four to three last week were thwarted by chief medical officer chris whitty, it has emerged.  the prime minister had wanted to reduce the five-stage alert level after announcing the partial easing of lockdown restrictions, which came into force yesterday.  however, the threat level has stayed at four, after professor whitty insisted it couldn't be lowered despite plans to relax rules.  this has led to fears that the government is ignoring the science as it moves to ease restrictions, after mr johnson said in his roadmap, published on may 11, that the alert level would have to be downgraded before any relaxation of lockdown.  mr johnson instead said the level was 'moving towards three', as a raft of restrictions in england were eased on monday. primary schools were reopened for reception, year one and year six, outdoor markets were reopened, along with car showrooms, while horse racing became the first sport to resume, though without spectators.  people in the vulnerable 'shielding' group who have until now been advised to stay indoors are also now allowed to go outside for a walk.  also as of yesterday, groups of up to six people are allowed to meet outside and even in private gardens.  the government has yet to explain exactly what data leads to a change in alert level, or whether benchmarks like daily infections and deaths are considered.  however, the alert level remains at four - which the government previously said would mean restrictions remain in place - despite the lockdown being eased.  downing street said yesterday that professor whitty and the joint biosecurity centre - the body tasked with assessing the covid-19 alert level - had recently discussed the coronavirus alert level. the prime minister's official spokesman said that professor whitty and the centre 'worked together on this last week'.  however, an official accused the government of 'wrecking' the centre's credibility by partially lifting lockdown measures this week without jbc saying that the alert level had decreased.  the official told the times: 'the jbc, like jtac (joint terrorism analysis centre), is designed to remove critical national security decision-making from the political arena. jbc's value and credibility has fallen at the first hurdle.'  later on monday evening, health secretary matt hancock added to the confusion after admitting that the joint biosecurity centre was not yet up and running.  responding to a question about potential local lockdowns in future, mr hancock said: 'the joint biosecurity centre's role is a national one to provide the advice and the information that would then be acted on locally.  'so the way to think of it is that the joint biosecurity centre has the information, it advises the cmos of the uk, who in turn give advice to ministers and to local public health bodies through phe.  'so that architecture is now established. the jbc still formally needs to come into existence, but we are putting in place all of those data flows to augment the already significant work that public health england do in this space.'  directly asked about whether the joint biosecurity centre exists, mr hancock said: 'yes. we're getting it stood up, making sure that all the information flows come to it so it's able to analyse them and to make sure that it gets set up correctly. all that work's being done, being done as we speak.'  pressed on whether it exists yet, mr hancock replied: 'well, it's being formulated at the moment, it's being pulled together, yeah.'  the prime minister's official spokesman said earlier on monday: 'in terms of the changes i think we were always clear that we would need to be meeting our five tests and i believe that we are.  'in terms of the alert level it's moving down from four to three. we've obviously been in the process of setting up the new centre and making it fully operational, and i think we're only now getting to that point.'  in other developments to britain's coronavirus crisis today:  some of the 2million pupils returning to primary school were turned away because headteachers 'weren't ready' for them;  britons were allowed to meet their friends for socially distant fun and games for the first time since march 23, with the easing of lockdown rules;  ikea shoppers at one store formed a giant three hour queue as the diy furniture giant reopened 19 furniture sites across england;  nhs covid-19 contact tracers said the system is 'obviously not ready' and admitted they have nothing to do all day - despite being paid up to £27-an-hour;  the government's plan to allow more than 2million vulnerable people outside lacks any scientific rationale and amounts to a pr stunt, an expert warned.  despite the easing of lockdown restrictions from yesterday, the covid-19 alert level remains at four and has not been reduced to three  chief medical officer chris whitty reportedly blocked the prime minister's hopes of reducing the alert level ahead of the easing of restrictions  the prime minister had wanted to reduce the five-stage alert level after announcing the partial easing of lockdown restrictions, which came into force yesterday  it comes as it was revealed that coronavirus infection rates in the north of england are now nearly twice as high as those in london, according to new research.  using figures from the covid symptom study, which uses an app that has been downloaded by 3.7million people to track coronavirus infections, kings college london researchers were able to estimate infection rates across the country.  they found that the mid point of infections in london is 124 per million people, while in the north west it is 215 per million and in the north east and yorkshire it is 225 per million, laying bare the regional differences in the spread of coronavirus.  the data shows that london, the south east and the south west are believed to now have the lowest infection rates in the uk.  on the other hand, wales and northern ireland are believed to have the highest figures - possibly as high as 768 per million people a day.  the research also revealed that the uk's daily infection rate could be as high as 11,300, far above public health england's figure of 1,936.  the study - run alongside health science company zoe - does however suggest that the number of daily infections is falling, down 17 per cent since last week.  number 10 yesterday hit back at warnings from experts that easing the lockdown will cause a spike in covid-19 cases, claiming the crucial coronavirus r-rate will stay below one if brits continue to adhere to the strict social distancing guidelines designed to halt the outbreak.  downing street said the scientific consensus is that it is 'unlikely' that the relaxation of guidelines in england will push the r rate - the number of people an infected patient passes the virus on to - past one, despite it already being between 0.7 and 0.9 and dangerously close to the threshold.  tories and top scientists have voiced alarm about the consequences of the tweaks in england - which include six people from different households being able to meet up in public places or gardens, primary schools starting to return, and more shops opening.  health chiefs today announced 111 more britons have died after testing positive for coronavirus - the lowest daily toll since boris johnson imposed the lockdown on march 23. but death numbers released on sundays and mondays are always significantly smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend.  shock new data has laid bare the coronavirus regional divide in britain, with the north of england having almost twice the infection rate of london  the

65 (49.6 per cent) who have registered none in the past 48 hours  department of health figures show the official number of covid-19 victims has actually risen to 39,045, a jump of 556 on yesterday's tally of 38,489. the extra 445 are because of a new reporting process.  additional 445 deaths added to the uk's total from new reporting process an additional 445 people who died with covid-19 have been added to the uk total following the introduction of a new reporting process. the new cumulative total of 39,045 deaths, announced on june 1, now includes cases identified under 'pillar 2' of the government's testing strategy. - which deaths are included in the new reporting process? the additional deaths are linked to cases identified through testing carried out by commercial partners, rather than testing that has been done in nhs and public health england (phe) laboratories. these tests would have been undertaken in care homes or in the community, rather than in a hospital setting, and are available for the wider population, as opposed to just key workers. - who were the additional 445 deaths? public health england (phe) said 'nearly all' of the 445 deaths, which date back to april 26, were care home residents. the deaths were previously categorised as 'probable' coronavirus cases, but have now been redefined as 'confirmed' cases, phe said. they occurred over a month-long period and do not represent a new 'surge' in the number of deaths, phe added. instead, the 445 deaths were added to the historic data retrospectively. - why was this data not published sooner? phe said collating data from across the various sources is 'technically difficult and challenging', adding it is not possible to get daily death counts from every care home and residence in the country. it said the data quality from pillar 2 testing had improved sufficiently to allow it to trace individual deaths and integrate them into routine reporting. - how does phe record the number of deaths? the number of people who have died with coronavirus is reported daily by the government using phe data. phe combines data from four different sources: deaths occurring in hospitals, deaths notified to phe health protection teams, laboratory test reports linked to deaths from electronic hospital records and office for national statistics (ons) death registrations which can be linked to laboratory-confirmed positive tests. the data, which goes back to march 2, does not include deaths in people where covid-19 was suspected, but a laboratory test was not carried out. advertisement  it comes as separate figures revealed today - the first day of england's lockdown being eased - that almost half of nhs hospital trusts in england have reported no new fatalities in the past 48 hours. two experts who analysed the statistics also revealed 12 trusts in england (9.2 per cent) have recorded no coronavirus deaths in the past week.  in tonight's downing street press conference, health secretary matt hancock also revealed 1,570 more brits have tested positive for the infection - the lowest number since the end of march. and he presented data that showed 479 patients were admitted to hospital with england on may 30, down 20 per cent in a week.  beaches and parks were swamped today, with thousands of brits taking advantage of the scorching weather on the first day of lockdown being eased since the draconian measures were introduced 10 weeks ago. local public health directors today revealed they fear ministers have lifted too many restrictions, too quickly.  hitting back at the claims, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'we have worked to gradually and safely ease the lockdown measures, the consensus from the scientists is if test and trace is up and running and the public follow the social distancing guidance then it's unlikely the measures will push the r above one.'  the reproduction rate - which the government has put at the heart of its plans to ease britain out of lockdown - denotes the number of other people an infected patient will pass the sickness on to and it must stay at one or below or britain will face another crisis.  however, the way the r is calculated means it is out of date, and the latest calculation is based on data from around three weeks ago - before the lockdown loosened. government advisers last week claimed the r range had dropped to 0.7-0.9, down from 0.7-1.  number 10's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance warned that the numbers are 'not coming down fast' in a downbeat update at friday's downing street press conference, and said the rate may be 'very close' to one in some areas.  the uk's deaths include 96 in england, nine in scotland, five in wales and one in northern ireland. yesterday officials announced 113 more covid-19 deaths, which was also the lowest daily toll since lockdown began on march 23 (74).  individual authorities have different cut-off points for records to be submitted, meaning the tallies added up for england, scotland, wales and northern ireland often don't match the final breakdown given by the dh.  nhs england recorded 108 more patients had died in hospitals.  wales posted five new deaths across all settings, while scotland and northern ireland registered one each.  processes for recording people's deaths are known for slowing down and even stopping at the weekends and on bank holidays, meaning there is a dip every monday - or tuesday if it follows a bank holiday - followed by surges on tuesdays and wednesdays.  it comes as two experts today crunched the numbers reported by nhs england, and found that almost half of trusts - 65, or 49.6 per cent - have recorded no deaths in the past 48 hours.  professor carl heneghan and dr jason oke, from the centre for evidence-based medicine at oxford university, said: 'today's reported figure is 108 deaths in hospitals in england: 79 (73 per cent) of these were in the last week.'  and they added that 12 trusts had registered no covid-19 deaths in the past week.  these were: alder hey children's nhs foundation trust (ft), gateshead health nhs ft, norfolk and suffolk nhs ft, north cumbria integrated

number of trusts not recording a death for 48 hours is the second-highest since the data collection began, down from 52.7 per cent yesterday.  in tonight's downing street press conference, health

some were turned away because headteachers 'weren't ready' for them.  up to 1,500 primary schools in england are estimated to be defying the government's controversial plan to get all reception, year 1 and year 6 children back in the classroom from june 1.  teachers have admitted they were 'anxious' to work and unions demanded the date be pushed back to june 15 at the earliest, amid fears the virus is still spreading at high levels.  parents have revealed many schools will remain closed for at least another week or more, while some have not yet set a date at all.  at least two dozen councils have refused to reopen their schools or left it up to headteachers, who are trying to find ways to ensure social distancing and have enough teachers to teach 'bubbles' of up to ten children.  mailonline revealed there was confusion at several schools across london, with some parents arriving with their children only to be informed they couldn't come in and had to go home again.  in other developments, ministers are desperately trying to quell a backlash over easing lockdown today despite the coronavirus alert level not having been reduced.  with beaches and parks again swamped as people take advantage of scorching weather, business secretary alok sharma was forced to deny there is a 'dash' to get the country back up and running.  he insisted the new contact tracing system means measures can be tightened again in specific areas if there is a flare up.  but downing street was forced to admit the alert level has still not been reduced from level four to three, even though the guidance suggested easing of lockdown is not possible until it was reduced.  tories and top scientists have voiced alarm about the consequences of the tweaks in england - which include six people

health,"advertisement  coronavirus infection rates in the north of england are now nearly twice as high as those in london, according to new research.  using figures from the covid symptom study, which uses an app that has been downloaded by 3.7million people to track coronavirus infections, kings college london researchers were able to estimate infection rates across the country.  they found that the mid point of infections in london is 124 per million people, while in the north west it is 215 per million and in the north east and yorkshire it is 225 per million, laying bare the regional differences in the spread of coronavirus.  the data shows that london, the south east and the south west are believed to now have the lowest infection rates in the uk.  on the other hand, wales and northern ireland are believed to have the highest figures - possibly as high as 768 per million people a day.  the research also revealed that the uk's daily infection rate could be as high as 11,300, far above public health england's figure of 1,936.  the study - run alongside health science company zoe - does however suggest that the number of daily infections is falling, down 17 per cent since last week.  it comes as number 10 today hit back at warnings from experts that easing the lockdown will cause a spike in covid-19 cases, claiming the crucial coronavirus r-rate will stay below one if brits continue to adhere to the strict social distancing guidelines designed to halt the outbreak.  downing street said the scientific consensus is that it is 'unlikely' that the relaxation of guidelines in england will push the r rate - the number of people an infected patient passes the virus on to - past one, despite it already being between 0.7 and 0.9 and dangerously close to the threshold.  tories and top scientists have voiced alarm about the consequences of the tweaks in england - which include six people from different households being able to meet up in public places or gardens, primary schools starting to return, and more shops opening.  health chiefs today announced 111 more britons have died after testing positive for coronavirus - the lowest daily toll since boris johnson imposed the lockdown on march 23. but death numbers released on sundays and mondays are always significantly smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend.  in other developments to britain's coronavirus crisis today:  some of the 2million pupils returning to primary school were turned away because headteachers 'weren't ready' for them;  britons were allowed to meet their friends for socially distant fun and games for the first time since march 23, with the easing of lockdown rules;  number 10 admitted the coronavirus alert level has still not been lowered, despite lockdown rules being eased in england;  ikea shoppers at one store formed a giant three hour queue as the diy furniture giant reopened 19 furniture sites across england;  nhs covid-19 contact tracers said the system is 'obviously not ready' and admitted they have nothing to do all day - despite being paid up to £27-an-hour;  the government's plan to allow more than 2million vulnerable people outside lacks any scientific rationale and amounts to a pr stunt, an expert warned.  shock new data has laid bare the coronavirus regional divide in britain, with the north of england having

coronavirus deaths in the past week, as well as 65 (49.6 per cent) who have registered none in the past 48 hours  department of health figures show the official number of covid-19 victims has actually risen to 39,045, a jump of 556 on yesterday's tally of 38,489. the extra 445 are because of a new reporting process.  additional 445 deaths added to the uk's total from new reporting process an additional 445 people who died with covid-19 have been added to the uk total following the introduction of a new reporting process. the new cumulative total of 39,045 deaths, announced on june 1, now includes cases identified under 'pillar 2' of the government's testing strategy. - which deaths are included in the new reporting process? the additional deaths are linked to cases identified through testing carried out by commercial partners, rather than testing that has been done in nhs and public health england (phe) laboratories. these tests would have been undertaken in care homes or in the community, rather than in a hospital setting, and are available for the wider population, as opposed to just key workers. - who were the additional 445 deaths? public health england (phe) said 'nearly all' of the 445 deaths, which date back to april 26, were care home residents. the deaths were previously categorised as 'probable' coronavirus cases, but have now been redefined as 'confirmed' cases, phe said. they occurred over a month-long period and do not represent a new 'surge' in the number of deaths, phe added. instead, the 445 deaths were added to the historic data retrospectively. - why was this data not published sooner? phe said collating data from across the various sources is 'technically difficult and challenging', adding it is not possible to get daily death counts from every care home and residence in the country. it said the data quality from pillar 2 testing had improved sufficiently to allow it to trace individual deaths and integrate them into routine reporting. - how does phe record the number of deaths? the number of people who have died with coronavirus is reported daily by the government using phe data. phe combines data from four different sources: deaths occurring in hospitals, deaths notified to phe health protection teams, laboratory test reports linked to deaths from electronic hospital records and office for national statistics (ons) death registrations which can be linked to laboratory-confirmed positive tests. the data, which goes back to march 2, does not include deaths in people where covid-19 was suspected, but a laboratory test was not carried out. advertisement  it comes as separate figures revealed today - the first day of england's lockdown being eased - that almost half of nhs hospital trusts in england have reported no new fatalities in the past 48 hours. two experts who analysed the statistics also revealed 12 trusts in england (9.2 per cent) have recorded no coronavirus deaths in the past week.  in tonight's downing street press conference, health secretary matt hancock also revealed 1,570 more brits have tested positive for the infection - the lowest number since the end of march. and he presented data that showed 479 patients were admitted to hospital with england on may 30, down 20 per cent in a week.  beaches and parks were swamped today, with thousands of brits taking advantage of the scorching weather on the first day of lockdown being eased since the draconian measures were introduced 10 weeks ago. local public health directors today revealed they fear ministers have lifted too many restrictions, too quickly.  hitting back at the claims, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'we have worked to gradually and safely ease the lockdown measures, the consensus from the scientists is if test and trace is up and running and the public follow the social distancing guidance then it's unlikely the measures will push the r above one.'  the reproduction rate - which the government has put at the heart of its plans to ease britain out of lockdown - denotes the number of other people an infected patient will pass the sickness on to and it must stay at one or below or britain will face another crisis.  however, the way the r is calculated means it is out of date, and the latest calculation is based on data from around three weeks ago - before the lockdown loosened. government advisers last week claimed the r range had dropped to 0.7-0.9, down from 0.7-1.  number 10's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance warned that the numbers are 'not coming down fast' in a downbeat update at friday's downing street press conference, and said the rate may be 'very close' to one in some areas.  the uk's deaths include 96 in england, nine in scotland, five in wales and one in northern ireland. yesterday officials announced 113 more covid-19 deaths, which was also the lowest daily toll since lockdown began on march 23 (74).  individual authorities have different cut-off points for records to be submitted, meaning the tallies added up for england, scotland, wales and northern ireland often don't match the final breakdown given by the dh.  nhs england recorded 108 more patients had died in hospitals.  wales posted five new deaths across all settings, while scotland and northern ireland registered one each.  processes for recording people's deaths are known for slowing down and even stopping at the weekends and on bank holidays, meaning there is a dip every monday - or tuesday if it follows a bank holiday - followed by surges on tuesdays and wednesdays.  it comes as two experts today crunched the numbers reported by nhs england, and found that almost half of trusts - 65, or 49.6 per cent - have recorded no deaths in the past 48 hours.  professor carl heneghan and dr jason oke, from the centre for evidence-based medicine at oxford university, said: 'today's reported figure is 108 deaths in hospitals in england: 79 (73 per cent) of these were in the last week.'  and they added that 12 trusts had registered no covid-19 deaths in the past week.  these were: alder hey children's nhs foundation trust (ft), gateshead health nhs ft, norfolk and suffolk nhs ft, north cumbria integrated care nhs ft, north middlesex university hospital nhs trust, oxford university hospitals nhs ft, poole hospital nhs ft, royal devon and exeter nhs ft, taunton and somerset nhs ft, the hillingdon hospitals nhs ft, weston area health nhs trust and whittington health nhs trust.  for comparison, that rate has barely changed since the academics began to analyse the figures on may 21. and the number of trusts not recording a death for 48 hours is the second-highest since the data collection began, down from 52.7 per cent yesterday.  in tonight's downing street press conference, health secretary matt hancock (pictured alongside testing coordinator professor john newton) also revealed 1,570 more brits have tested positive for the infection - the lowest number since the end of march  restrictions across the country lifted today as outdoor markets reopened along with car showrooms. horse racing also resumed at newcastle racecourse but there will be no spectators present at the venue as mass gatherings remain banned. and vulnerable people who have until now been advised to stay indoors due to the coronavirus pandemic will be permitted to go outside.

some were turned away because headteachers 'weren't ready' for them.  up to 1,500 primary schools in england are estimated to be defying the government's controversial plan to get all reception, year 1 and year 6 children back in the classroom from june 1.  teachers have admitted they were 'anxious' to work and unions demanded the date be pushed back to june 15 at the earliest, amid fears the virus is still spreading at high levels.  parents have revealed many schools will remain closed for at least another week or more, while some have not yet set a date at all.  at least two dozen councils have refused to reopen their schools or left it up to headteachers, who are trying to find ways to ensure social distancing and have enough teachers to teach 'bubbles' of up to ten children.  mailonline revealed there was confusion at several schools across london, with some parents arriving with their children only to be informed they couldn't come in and had to go home again.  in other developments, ministers are desperately trying to quell a backlash over easing lockdown today despite the coronavirus alert level not having been reduced.  with beaches and parks again swamped as people take advantage of scorching weather, business secretary alok sharma was forced to deny there is a 'dash' to get the country back up and running.  he insisted the new contact tracing system means measures can be tightened again in specific areas if there is a flare up.  but downing street was forced to admit the alert level has still not been reduced from level four to three, even though the guidance suggested easing of lockdown is not possible until it was reduced.  tories and top scientists have voiced alarm about the consequences of the tweaks in england - which include six people

health,"contact tracers have warned the nhs system designed to curb the spread of covid-19 in britain is 'obviously not ready' - and revealed they are being paid up to £27-an-hour to do nothing.  health officials warned 'key bits' of the programme for england were not yet up-and-running when it went live on thursday, four days ahead of the billed start date of june 1.  scores of the 25,000 employees hired by the government have come forward to say they have had no positive cases allocated to them since the launch, with one even suggesting there was a fault with the system.  contact tracers say the system remains 'shambolic' and unfit for purpose as millions of pupils return to school today. workers last week also complained they hadn't had any training by the time it launched and had waited weeks for log-in details.  the tracing programme aims to halt the virus and control local flare-ups by asking anyone who has been in contact with a covid-19 positive case to self-isolate for 14 days.  but there are concerns britons will refuse to give friends or relatives details, and one call handler revealed two of the three potentially infected contacts she rang went straight to voicemail.  the goal is to rapidly test anyone who logs covid-19 symptoms - but antigen testing figures have barely budged in the past few days, and many brits have to wait days to get their swab results. around 8,000 brits have been diagnosed with the disease since the system was launched.  the head of the nhs test and trace has said test timings need to improve, and top experts say the system will only work if cases are turned around quickly - otherwise the virus will continue to spread.  the government has failed to reveal exactly how many people have been tested for eight days now, and has yet to provide information for how many people have been traced so far.  a government diagram explain how the nhs test and trace system will work  contact tracers say the system in england is 'obviously not ready' while admitting they are being paid up to £27 per hour to do nothing. pictured, operators in belgium  the government insisted yesterday that the system was running efficiently and had the capacity to handle 10,000 new cases per day. for comparison, statistics suggest fewer than 8,000 brits are being struck down each day.  boris johnson said the programme would be 'world beating' but evidence suggests the contact-tracing army has been left ill-prepared and, in many cases, workers have nothing to do – at a cost to the taxpayer of £1.6million per day.  one in ten britons will ignore self isolation rules at least 10 per cent of britons will ignore requests to self-isolate when contacted by nhs covid tracers, a health chief has warned. professor isabel oliver helped design the government's tracing app to track those who are at risk of being infected. the director of the field epidemiology service at public health england told the sunday telegraph that though most people are willing to comply, a minority will disobey instructions. it is thought that lockdown fatigue will cause people to ignore advice offered to them. 'this has been a very prolonged outbreak,' she said. 'invariably we find that everyone is very willing to help, but these are exceptional circumstances, with an outbreak that has been so prolonged and had such an extensive impact on the people's lives, so it is understanding that some people will be resistant. 'but having said that we are finding that lots of people are supportive and we are very grateful for that because for the programme to be successful in controlling the virus - we need that support from the nation as a whole.' test and trace launched in england on thursday and professor oliver's team immediately hit a wall of it problems. but she stressed that any delays to having tracers logged in was down to the fact that the app is run on a 'very secure system'. advertisement  on a public facebook group for clinical contact tracers, several reported spending most of their shifts waiting to be assigned cases through the system, called ctas.  it is supposed to show the patients assigned to a tracer along with unassigned cases that can be picked up.  one tracer said he had not had any cases on saturday, while another said two of three calls she made went straight to voicemail, the times reports.  one of the 3,000 clinical case workers hired by public health england said she had completed three four-hour shifts, at £27-an-hour, but hadn't made any calls yet. she told the times: 'i have had absolutely nothing to do.'  the nurse said she had seen 'zero cases' on the system throughout three shifts and felt 'tremendously guilty about doing the shifts and being paid and not having anything to do really'.  'it's very obviously not ready,' she said. 'something is not working between ctas and the test results that are coming in.'  another contact tracer said he was still waiting for login details to access training, and said the system had been 'chaotic'.  his job as a 'tier three' call handler should be to ring the contacts of positive cases and tell them to self-isolate and curb the potential spread of covid-19.  details of those who test positive are passed to a company called sitel, which is running the track and trace handling across the uk.  agents read from a prepared script when they are given the name and telephone number of a person who has been diagnosed with covid-19.  they ask for the details of friends and family the infected person has come into contact with during the previous two weeks.  the tracing agent then makes contact with those on their list and informs them they have to self-isolate.  one tracer said colleagues who were on shift were 'sitting there all day waiting and just refreshing their screens'. he said: 'they've got nothing to do.'  a department of health and social care spokesperson said the 'overwhelming majority' of workers have had no concerns and that the claims do not represent the 'huge amount of work already underway' for the service.  'all staff have been trained and are fully supported in their work following procedures designed by public health experts,' they said.  the public have not been given much confidence so far that they will not be phoned by a scammer and told to self-isolate.  when asked how members of the public can be sure a phone call is genuine, dr jenny harries, the deputy chief medical officer for england, said it was 'highly unlikely with all the confidentiality around the data systems that you will be contacted inappropriately by anyone'.  speaking at yesterday's downing street briefing, she said: 'i think it will be very obvious in the conversation you have with them that they are genuine in that regard.  'i think it will be very evident when somebody rings you these are professionally trained individuals and sitting over them are a group of senior clinical professionals.'  it followed a warning from a health official that at least 10 per cent of britons will ignore requests to self-isolate when contacted by nhs covid-19 tracers, due to lockdown fatigue or having to keep working.  professor isabel oliver, who helped design the government's tracing app, told the sunday telegraph that though most people are willing to comply, a minority will disobey instructions.    the government has so far refused to say exactly how many brits have been contact traced.  matt hancock claimed the 200,000-a-day coronavirus testing target had been met yesterday - but the number of people who have actually been tested has not come close to that figure.  the department of health said only 115,725 tests had been carried out yesterday. but it has not been giving out the number for how many individuals were actually tested for eight days now. some tests are carried out twice.  the health secretary said the uk had the 'capacity' for 205,634 tests daily as of yesterday, describing it as 'one of the greatest national mobilisations we have seen'.  but the level was also only reached by including 'capacity' to conduct 40,000 antibody tests - which tell if someone has previously had the infection, and not if they have it currently.  scientists have repeatedly said the contact tracing system will only work if testing is rapid because the aim is to find and isolate contacts of a positive case before they become infectious and spread the virus to others.  head of nhs test and trace baroness dido harding has said test timings have 'got to get better and better'.  the launch in england on thursday came as a shock to some workers who hadn't been told what to do. many contact tracers had no idea the system was launching that day. others hadn't completed basic training.  'people are panicking as there is no information on the websites/systems to make the calls,' wrote one test and trace caller at 9.39am, on the day test and trace went live, in an internal chat seen by the daily mail.  others reported being sent their link for training at 8pm the night before the launch, while a manager said the instructions for what to do would 'cascade' down from the top on the day of the launch while admitting the process had been 'frustrating'.  an internal chat seen by the daily mail says, 'people are also panicking as there is no information on the websites/systems for them to make the calls'  britain abandoned test and trace in march because it could only handle five new cases per week britain abandoned test and tracing for the coronavirus earlier in the pandemic because the system could only cope with five cases a week, it has emerged. official documents from the government's sage advisory committee reveal that the routine testing and tracing of contacts of people with the virus was stopped because public health england was facing a desperate shortage of capacity. since the first covid-19 cases were confirmed in york on january 31, 272,826 people in the uk have since tested positive for the virus. this week the government launched the nhs england's test and trace programme, with 25,000 contact tracing staff and the capacity to trace the 10,000 contacts per day. the decision to scrap routine testing for those displaying symptoms 12 weeks ago is now being seen as a major factor for how the uk has the fifth-highest total number of infections. sage documents show how, in a meeting on february 18, advisors said that public health england (phe) could only manage the contacts of five covid cases a week, hoping to possibly increase this to 50 people. minutes from the meeting say: 'currently phe can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).  some 10,000 call handlers were employed by serco, one of which approached the mail last week concerned that the system was catastrophically under-prepared.  'there's absolutely no chance it's ready,' the 38-year-old whistle-blower from manchester said.  'if it does happen [this week]… there will be catastrophic and continued failings from that day onwards. this is serious – it's a pandemic, and lives are at risk. i'm genuinely worried about how we are about to be set loose on the public.'  on thursday an ex-shop worker now paid £10-an-hour as an nhs coronavirus 'track and tracer' claimed she had nothing to do.  the call handler, who asked not to be named, told mailonline she had been paid to sit and do nothing, and warned there was 'nothing we can do' about infected brits who refuse to hand over the names and telephone numbers of people they came into close contact with.  she said: 'everything is voluntary and if they refuse to give us the names and telephone numbers there is nothing we can do,' said the track and trace agent.  'we work from a script and try to persuade the person to be co-operative but if they hang up we just move on to the next person. it seems a major flaw, but there is nothing we can really do about it.'  one contact tracer told lbc radio on friday it had been a 'complete shambles' so far, and they had not received their logon details for the site.  and before 11am, medical phone handlers reported that the system had crashed, and were greeted with the message that 'this has been reported as a critical incident'.  a department of health spokesman denied that the whole system had crashed.  'anyone in the country can log on and book a test if they have symptoms and we have tracers logged on to do their vital work to help stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives,' the spokesman said.  'as with all large scale operations of this kind, some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved.'  there are concerns about the fact the local aspect of the tracing system will not be ready until at least the end of june - as told to mps by baroness dido harding.  one of the contact tracers said she had not been told how to escalate cases, something she is required to do when there is a larger public health concern, such as if a covid-19 patient has visited a care home or school.  it comes as reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in england return to schools amid anxiety that the move has come too early.  several scientists have criticised major changes in the lockdown today, suggesting it is too early to lift restrictions and could cause infections to rapidly rise again.  so what do you need to know about the nhs test and trace system for england? and how will it affect you and your loved ones?  where do i get a coronavirus test?  anyone with coronavirus symptoms - a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste - can now apply to get tested for the infection through the nhs.  officials offer brits with tell-tale symptoms the chance to either test themselves at home, or to get swabbed at a drive-through centre.  the test involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud.  anyone going to get tested must drive themselves, or be taken to their local site by someone they live with to prevent unnecessarily spreading the virus.  the nhs says you can take up to three other people you live with to be tested at the same time.  home-tests - which involve you taking the swab yourself - are sent through the post and should arrive within 24 hours.  officials admit the test is best taken within five days of symptoms starting, and say that you may not get a test if you apply because of supply issues.  essential workers, such as nhs or social care staff, apply to be tested on a different government-run website.  how long will it be before i know if i have the coronavirus?  the aim of the scheme is to get all test results processed and returned within 24 hours but it is unlikely to hit that goal right at the start of the rollout.  that means some people could face lengthy waits to find out if they have tested positive, potentially delaying the tracing process and allowing the virus to spread.  baroness harding said of the test timings so far: 'yesterday, the turnaround time of our tests - we returned 84 per cent of all tests in our drive-in centres within 24 hours.  'and 95 per cent of all tests within 48 hours. i still don't think that's good enough. it's got to get better and better.'  can employers ask for proof someone has been quarantined?  for the first seven days, employees do not need to offer their bosses any proof that they are sick or self-isolating.  but workers who have placed themselves in quarantine need to follow their firm's usual sickness reporting policy, lawyers say.  employers can seek evidence that a member of staff has been quarantined after a week off work, the government says.  officials launched an nhs scheme that allows brits to get an isolation note, in case they are asked for proof of absence from their employer.  am i entitled to sick pay while i am self-isolating?  many brits who have no symptoms and can work from home will be expected to do so, if they are told to self-isolate.  but statutory sick pay (ssp) is available for people who are unable to carry out their job while they are self-isolating - either because they are sick or their job cannot be done at home.  the ssp - £95.85 a week - is available from the first day you are off and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. before coronavirus, ssp was only a legal requirement on the fourth day of absence.  many companies pay employees more than the ssp and have their own policies for how long this can be claimed for.  workers on zero-hour contracts must prove they earn at least £120 per week before they can claim ssp. those who earn under that threshold can access universal credit.  brits who are self-employed cannot claim ssp but can apply for an employment and support allowance (esa) if they are ill.  who is a 'close contact'?  a close contact is anyone who has been within two metres (6ft 6in) of the infected person for more than 15 minutes without protective equipment.  the government hopes the requirements of the system will focus the minds of the public on the importance of maintaining social distancing.  when the coronavirus app is up and running, the victim's mobile phone should automatically identify anyone they have come close to.  until that happens, patients will identify likely contacts via an online process.  what about scotland, wales and northern ireland?  scotland has announced its own system will start today.  wales' system is set to start in early june, while northern ireland has its own version of the nhs test and trace system up and running.  can i choose where to isolate if i have a small child?  the government is encouraging people not to follow the example of boris johnson's aide dominic cummings, who travelled to durham during lockdown.  officials want people to stay at home, while councils will offer support to parents who do not have relatives or friends who can help.  a mailonline chart explains how the new nhs test and trace system is expected to work  are there any pitfalls? if so, what are they?  yes there are pitfalls. this scheme has been cobbled together as quickly as possible by ministers and officials working under extreme pressure.  experts immediately said the complexity of the programme meant there could be 'several points of failure' while the government's political opponents said ministers should never have largely ditched contact tracing in the first place.  without the app, contact-tracking will be based on the say so of people who have tested positive. that means people will need to remember exactly where they have been and who they have been close in the days leading up to their positive test.  if people forget or remember inaccurately who they've seen, the virus could spread.  baroness harding told the downing street briefing: 'we have 25,000 contact tracers ready to start work tomorrow - that is easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown.'  she said data from the isle of wight suggests people have been within two metres of fewer than five others at the moment.  how important is contact tracing to beating coronavirus?  the royal society believes that contact tracing reduces infection by up to 15 per cent and will miss cases, but even a marginal effect could be crucial in bringing the r infection rate below one and as close to zero as possible.  however, world-leading experts from the prestigious scientific academy warned the scheme was 'not a silver bullet'.  they said if compliance is low and testing times don't come down, infection rates may only drop by 5 per cent.  what happens if people refuse to isolate? will they be fined?  the government has said that it is relying on the british public to voluntarily self-isolate if they display symptoms of covid-19.  but it has warned that it will impose penalties if people do not follow its orders. spot checks could be made to households and fines could be issued.  it is not known how much people would be fined if caught flouting self-isolation.  a spokesman for the department of health and social care told mailonline: 'we are confident that the public will want to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus to keep themselves, their families and communities safe and to protect the nhs. this means complying with advice to self-isolate.  'however, if we find that people are not complying with isolation instructions, we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're at home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house.'  at yesterday's press conference, health secretary matt hancock said the government is 'confident' that when told to self-isolate, people will, adding: 'now of course we could also mandate that, but in the first instance we're not going to.  'this will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing.  'but, we can quickly make it mandatory if that is what it takes. because, if we don't collectively make this work, then the only way forward is to keep the lockdown.'  could people end up having to self-isolate repeatedly?  yes. the government has discussed imposing 'local lockdowns' on whole towns if there are future regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases.  mr hancock said that the ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions will be part of the nhs test, track and trace system.  this could lead to local schools, businesses or workplaces being closed in areas with high prevalence of infection, according to the government's 'exit strategy'.  however, part of the rationale for the test and trace system is to allow local, small-scale action to be taken where there appears to be an outbreak.  will i have to self-isolate if i've already had a positive antibody test?  yes, even people who have tested positive for antibodies will have to adhere to the rules.  nhs and care homes workers have been receiving the tests, which scour the blood for the infection-fighting substances, over the past week.  thousands of private antibody tests were also being sold to britons on online pharmacies such as superdrug.  antibodies are substances produced by the immune system in response to an infection, and their presence is thought to provide some protection against the illness.  but scientists are still uncertain how long this immunity lasts, or how much protection the covid-19 antibodies provide.  private antibody tests are also not 100 per cent accurate, meaning there are some people who will test positive but have never actually had the disease.  this might give them false confidence that they cannot be infected and prompt them to take unnecessary risks.  will people who have had coronavirus be exempt from self-isolating if they come into contact with a new covid-19 sufferer?  no. even people who have had positive tests for coronavirus will have to stay at home for 14 days if they come into close contact with a new sufferer.  the government has said that the scientific advice remains that it is uncertain if people who have had the virus are immune to it.  what checks are in place to stop it being open to abuse, or pretending to have the disease as a joke?  the emphasis of the entire scheme is on testing people. so people claiming to have the disease will be tested. there will be very little wriggle room.  although if those who test positive fail or refuse to reveal who they have been in contact with, without the app there is very little the contact tracers can do to tell if people are telling the truth.  who is in charge of the operation where i am?  councils and public health officials will be tasked with cracking down on local outbreaks of covid-19, but it is not clear who will lead those efforts.  it is also not clear today how many staff members would be available to help or if local authorities will get extra funding and powers to act appropriately.  why not simply keep going the way we are?    though the government claims that lockdown has dramatically reduced covid-associated deaths, the national restrictions are destroying the economy.  millions of workers have been furloughed by small businesses and big companies since tough restrictions on movement were introduced by the government.  over half of the adult population of the uk is now being paid by the state in some capacity, whether in the public sector, on furlough, or benefits.  business and companies have received hundreds of billions of pounds in emergency loans to date from chancellor rishi sunak.  but this state of affairs cannot continue forever.  economists estimated in early april that lockdown, which began on march 23, is costing britain around £2.4billion per day.  the bank of england forecast that uk gdp contracted by two per cent in the first quarter, and is set to shrink by 30 per cent in the second quarter.  bank staff believe the economy could 'bounce' by around 15 per cent by the end of the year, meaning the uk would be around 15 per cent poorer than before lockdown.  faced with what the bank called the biggest economic nosedive in 300 years, the government is trying to restart the engines of uk plc.  the pm has committed himself to bringing britain out of lockdown safely by managing the risk to public health posed by coronavirus.  the nhs test and trace system is meant to help do just that.  mr hancock told the press briefing: 'until an effective treatment or vaccine comes through how can we get back to doing more of the things that make life worth living without risking safety or putting lives at risk? nhs test and trace is a big part - not the only part - but a big part of the answer to that question.'  what is this app people are talking about?  the nhs trace and test system is being launched without its nhs contact-tracing app centrepiece, prompting concerns that without the new technology the government could struggle to tackle the spread of covid-19.  experts believe the app will be crucial to the success of the programme because it can identify contacts much quicker than human contact tracers.  the smartphone app uses bluetooth to register other phones it has been near for a prolonged period of time. a date has not been set for the nationwide roll out of the app but without it contact tracing will not be as swift as it would be with it.  matt hancock said it is 'not technical problems' which are preventing the test and trace app from being rolled out nationwide.  he said: 'it is that one of the things we learnt about in the isle of wight is that rolling out the system where people are asked to isolate, even if they have no symptoms, starts better when it comes in human form from the contact tracers.'  mr hancock added that 'the app is working in the isle of wight', and said that when the government has 'successfully embedded' the new nhs test and trace system, 'then that is the time to bring the app to bear'.  he continued: 'because the app is a compliment to this system, even without it this system would be successful, but it is a compliment because there are some contacts that you don't know that you might have made.'  have other countries used contact tracing?  south korea has monitored credit card transactions, cctv footage and mobile phone locations, while singapore has used police investigations and detective work to piece together where people have been and who they've seen.  iceland saw 40 per cent of the population download its app, though its government says manual tracing is just as important.  austria introduced a decentralised app operated by the red cross, which users can manually control. it was the first to roll out this app.  how long will the contact tracing scheme run for?  ministers have not put a time limit on the programme, but it will likely remain in place in some form until a vaccine is developed - which might not be until 2021.  government scientists are studying how much immunity people have against coronavirus if they've previously been infected.  if it turns out that they are completely immune for months then people who have already had the disease may not have to adhere to the rules.  what class as symptoms of coronavirus?  anyone with a new, continuous cough, a high temperature or a change in their sense of smell or taste is asked to immediately book a test.  but researchers have linked 11 other symptoms to the virus, including fatigue, chest pain and diarrhoea.  experts have previously accused ministers of 'missing the ball' by only listing three official symptoms."
health,"a ground-breaking trial will examine the long-term damage inflicted by covid-19 on major organs.  while growing evidence suggests the virus attacks not only the lungs but other parts of the body, including the heart, liver and kidneys, the severity and prevalence of these injuries, the type of people most at risk and how they recover is as yet unknown.  now, a two-year study — the first of its kind in the uk — hopes to answer these questions, using scans of coronavirus patients.  the coverscan trial is recruiting 500 people who have recovered from confirmed covid-19 infection. they will be monitored for a year for signs of health changes triggered by the virus.  rehab support workers talk with morag ellison, 77, at the nhs seacole centre at headley court, surrey. the facility will help care for and support patients recovering from covid-19  patients will have an mri scan when they sign up, then another a year later. the researchers will look for liver inflammation, kidney swelling or shrinkage and loss of elasticity in the lungs, among other symptoms of damage. blood tests will be carried out to check for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol, which can also affect the health of organs.  the results will be compared with control samples taken from tens of thousands of volunteers long before the pandemic.  it is difficult to estimate accurately how common organ damage might be until the trial is completed. however, data from patients with sars — a disease caused by a virus which behaves in a similar way to the novel coronavirus — showed that nearly half had heart abnormalities 12 years after being diagnosed.  ‘depending on the trial outcome, early action would save patients and the health service from the potential long-term burden of covid-19 related disease,’ says dr matt kelly, a biomedical scientist who is involved in running the trial for perspectum, a spin-out company of the university of oxford and oxford university hospitals nhs trust.  rehab support workers talk with patient audrey buckland, 92, as the first patients are admitted to the nhs seacole centre at headley court, surrey, a disused military hospital  ‘it could mean the difference between having a heart attack or not; needing a liver transplant or reversing the damage.’  blood samples taken from patients in the trial will also be analysed for any gene variations that could help determine who is most susceptible to organ damage.  ‘early studies have suggested certain genes make some people more vulnerable to the virus getting into the lungs and cause lasting damage after they’ve recovered [from covid-19],’ says dr kelly.  ‘identifying who is most at risk could also help identify what treatments they need to protect them.’  nursing staff work in a ward where another drug testing trial, named tactic-r, is being carried out at addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge. thursday may 21, 2020  much remains unknown about exactly how the virus harms the body. but viruses similar to the one that causes covid-19 are known to invade organs.  in response, the body tries to fight back by releasing infection-attacking chemicals which cause swelling and inflammation. in extreme cases, healthy tissue is damaged in the process, leading to scarring, which makes organs stiff and unable to function healthily.  the patients selected for the coverscan trial will be monitored at mayo clinic healthcare in london, and at a mobile screening unit in oxford.  the results are for research purposes only — so participants won’t receive them. but any medically significant findings will be sent to their gp, who will discuss them with the patient.  for more information, write to coverscan@perspectum.com or visit coverscan.com"
health,"the government's plans to allow more than 2 million of england's most vulnerable people outside lacks any scientific rationale and amounts to a public relations exercise, a virus expert has said.  families will be able to see their elderly relatives again today as millions of those who have been 'shielding' due to a high risk of suffering severe coronavirus symptoms are allowed to spend time outdoors.  as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, 2.2 million of the country's most vulnerable will be able to go outside with members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines.  those who live alone will be able to meet outside with one other person from another household.  but dr stephen griffin, associate professor at the university of leeds' school of medicine, told the guardian the move 'seems to lack any obvious rationale other than to add to an ongoing ''good news'' narrative that appears to have little grounding in reality'.  an elderly woman wearing a protective face visor while out in notting hill today amid lockdown restrictions being lifted  a family reunite in the front garden of an east london home for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown was put in place  and in a response to health secretary matt hancock's tweet announcing the move, oxford-based palliative care expert dr rachel clarke said: 'why on earth would you announce this without first communicating with primary care teams? you know, the gps who actually look after these vulnerable patients.'  who is 'vulnerable' and who should have been 'shielding'? britain was told to follow social distancing guidelines as the country entered lockdown months ago. but those at higher risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus were instructed to 'shield', minimising contact with others as much as possible. those who are 'clinically vulnerable' includes everyone over 70. this group was not told to 'shield' but was still advised to take precautions. but the 'clinically extremely vulnerable', including those with severe health conditions, were contacted by the nhs and advised to 'shield'. advertisement  the tweet, which has been liked more than 12,000 times, added: 'do headlines mean more than best patient care?'  genevieve edwards, chief executive at bowel cancer uk, told mailonline: 'this move feels incredibly rushed, with a lack of clear scientific rationale outlined as yet.  'more than 42,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year, and many of those living with the disease – and their families - have been shielding for several weeks to avoid catching coronavirus.  'they will be rightly concerned at the seeming lack of evidence that says it's suddenly now safe for them to go out after taking such major steps to protect themselves.'  rob burley, director of campaigns at muscular dystrophy uk, said advice to shield people had already been confusing, but the dramatic announcement risked making the situation worse.  'we are now faced with further confusion about why the advice has changed so suddenly when only a few weeks ago the government's recovery strategy said shielding would have to remain in place for a further period,' he said.  head of policy at the ms society, phil anderson, said his organisation was very concerned that the news had come from nowhere, and the extremely vulnerable will 'rightly want to hear a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them'.  families will be able to see their elderly relatives again today as millions of those who have been 'shielding' due to a high risk of suffering severe coronavirus symptoms are allowed to spend time outdoors (pictured: nhs seacole centre at headley court, surrey on may 28)  as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, 2.2 million of the country's most vulnerable will be able to go outside with members of their household. pictured: judy gillingham (right) shows her dog to her friend dorothy saxby (left) during a drive-through visit at gracewell, a residential care home in adderbury, on may 28  it comes as figures show the number of deaths of patients with coronavirus nears 40,000  vivienne tickle has been shielding since receiving an official text on march 23, followed by a letter, due to her asthma being classed as severe because of the medication needed to control it.  she told mailonline: 'this sudden lifting seems so out of the blue, no explanation or real guide other than to say we can go out. i feel quite nervous i don't think we have everything in place, the daily death rate although considerably lower still remains in the hundreds.  'my sister died during the peak week, 300 miles away no visiting, no funeral attendance. does the government really have any idea how hard a death bed goodbye is with a nurse holding the phone, whilst you try to get some words out through your sorrow?  'my sister's cause of death - covid-19 pneumonia and asthma. so i think until we have more medical and scientific evidence as to why it's suddenly safe for us to go out today, i'll be treating it with caution. i sincerely hope there is evidence to back it up and isn't a pr exercise there are millions of lives at stake here.'  david blythe, 75, has copd, asthma and emphysema. he said: 'for the past 70 days my daughter-carer has protected me rigidly during my period of quarantine. today i am told i can go outside, but in my diary, my quarantine does not end until june 22.  'i feel the ending of my quarantine is not based on solid medical fact. i believe all the relaxing of lockdown regulations are the result of the government backing down in the face of public opinion. so the thought of catching covid-19, after being so well protected, is not worth the risk. i shall stay shielded until the 22nd, and look at the situation again then.'  jan potworowski said he only goes out for occasional walks in his local parks in streatham, south london  linda holland, 68, with emphysema, said she and her mother, 88, have both been shielding.  'i have told mum that we are still in lockdown until at least the end of june, possibly longer,' she said. 'seeing all the crowds on our local beaches is more than enough to make me feel we are far better off as we are. at home with our little dogs and safe.  'yes i have children and grandchildren but we are all aware that grandma and mum need to be safe.'  beth fryer, 51, got a letter telling her to shield because she is on strong immune suppressant medication to tackle crohns disease.  she said: 'i've only been out a handful of times since the lockdown and that was for short walks either early in the day or late at night when no one was around.  'it's been hard not seeing anyone for so long and i've gone a bit stir crazy, but i don't live alone, there's four other people in my household so i've not been lonely.  'you just have to manage as best you can and hope it doesn't go on for that long. i have been planning on coming out more anyway, it wasn't just due to the new advice.'  retired erica, 68, who is said although she has not been sent an official shielding letter, she has been staying indoors as much as possible  jan potworowski, who was a child when the nazis invaded his native poland and then lived through communist rule after world war two, said he only goes out for occasional walks in his local parks in streatham, south london.  the 90-year-old former maths professor at brunel university, said: 'i'm not strictly in the shielding group as i didn't get a letter from the government.  'but i don't go out much and haven't been to a shop this whole time due to my age and i've had cancer twice. usually my wife goes to the shop as she is younger and healthier.  'when i do go out i only go to the park and try and stay away from crowds.  'i go early in the morning when there is less people. i carry hand sanitizer and have a mask if i do go near any crowded areas.  'i was quite frightened when we were in the peak. sometimes i wondered if i would wake up or not.  'the new rules are so muddled people have been left confused. that lack of knowledge about what is actually going on is very frustrating.  'i'm sure if they waited another two weeks schools could have got themselves more ready.  'i'm just angry because i don't want us to have to go through it again if there is a second wave.  virginia munrow said although she has not been shielding, some of her neighbours in their 90s have still not left the house despite the relaxing of restrictions  'people like me are in the firing line and i've had quite enough of that in my life. i don't want to become terrorised by another peak.  'the good thing about it is people are getting to know their neighbours more and people who i haven't spoken to in years are getting in touch by email.  'i do miss my family, we can have zoom calls, but it's not the same as meeting in person.'  trevor tillman, 65, said he will still not be going out much due to his health problems, despite the most at risk groups being allowed to outside from today.  he said: 'i've got bad asthma and diabetes so although i've not had an official letter i have been shielding.  'i only go to the quiet areas of the park, i don't go to the shops, i either get food delivered or my daughter goes for me.  'i don't wear a mask because i never go anywhere where there's many people and i dont go out for that long.  'i'll still be doing the same things now, it doesn't matter what government say, it's still not completely safe yet. the government just make it up as they go along anyway.'  retired erica, 68, who is said although she has not been sent an official shielding letter, she has been staying indoors as much as possible.  she said: 'i've not been going into the shops much, only when i have to go myself, apart from that i've not been at much.  'i carry hand sanitizer and have bought some face masks, i've not used them yet and will probably only use them if i go to crowded places or on public transport.  'i think it's very difficult for the government to judge because if you live in a big city and they have got a diverse population with different economic groups you probably have to be quite tough on everyone to protect the majority of people.  'i think they have got it about right.'  virginia munrow said although she has not been shielding, some of her neighbours in their 90s have still not left the house despite the relaxing of restrictions on the at risk group.  the 58-year-old said: 'i've got uncles who have been shielding, one due to having a pacemaker, and a neighbour in her 90s who has not been outside.  over the weekend boris johnson hailed the 'resilience' of those who have been shielding since march, with many having no face-to-face contact since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic  'she has been totally locked away except for going in her garden. my uncle still hasn't been outside, not even to post a letter, except for in his communal garden.  'i think it's a shame the government didn't wait a couple of weeks to let the infection rate drop lower before easing some of the restrictions. people will have felt a bit safer that way.  'but then it is nice to be able to see friends and relatives and as long as it's safe to do so.'  over the weekend boris johnson hailed the 'resilience' of those who have been shielding since march, with many having no face-to-face contact since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.  he spoke after england's deputy chief medical officer pleaded with britons 'not to tear the pants out of' the loosened lockdown when more freedoms are granted on monday.  professor jonathan van-tam warned that abusing new liberties would fuel the spread of infection and said that the lifting of curbs should be treated as if gently lifting the lid on a coiled spring - 'painstakingly' slow.  the top scientific adviser said the country was at a 'very dangerous moment' in the crisis and gave his colourful instruction to the public as thousands of sun-seekers packed on to beaches to bask in scorching weather.  the president of the association of directors of public health has said experts are concerned ministers are lifting the coronavirus lockdown too quickly, claiming the government's own five tests have not been met.  dr jeanelle de gruchy told bbc radio 4's today programme: 'in terms of the r (rate of infection), it's 0.7 to 0.9 in the latest government assessment.  'it is below one but it's a very limited room for manoeuvre isn't it and we know how quickly this virus can spread and it's difficult to predict then with quite a lot of the measures being eased at once what the impact that will have on the r value.  'we're also concerned about meeting all the other operational challenges ready to meet a potential rise in infections.'  the president of the association of directors of public health has said experts are concerned ministers are lifting the coronavirus lockdown too quickly, claiming the government's own five tests have not been met (pictured: two girls, aged 3 and 1, visiting their great-grandparents in norfolk)  official mobility data shows the number of people venturing out to parks has increased far above pre-lockdown levels as people look to socialise in outdoor spaces (pictured: victoria park, london, may 30)  she said the national testing programme and the test and trace scheme must be 'robust and ready', and that personal protective equipment (ppe) supply must be adequate.  'we're not feeling just yet that we're confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures,' she added.  gps have said 'extreme caution' is needed, in particular for those battling cancer and other serious long-term conditions.  it comes as official mobility data shows the number of people venturing out to parks has increased far above pre-lockdown levels as people look to socialise in outdoor spaces.  the warning also came as crowds flocked to beaches and parks in defiance of the lockdown rules that remained in force over the weekend.  they were tempted by temperatures that soared to 80f (27c) with the country enjoying the sunniest spring since records began and the driest may since 1862."
health,"thousands of americans left their homes and took to the streets to protest across the country after the death of george floyd.  the 46-year-old black man died in minneapolis, minnesota, on memorial day after a white police officer arrested him for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 and knelt on his neck for eight minutes while floyd gasped: 'i cant' breathe!'  with demonstrations taking place in los angeles, new york city and washington, dc, there are concerns that the mass gatherings could trigger a second wave of coronavirus infections.  many protestors have been seen ignoring social distancing guidelines and not wearing protective gear such as masks.  however, one expert has warned that the shouting and running around that occurs at many demonstrations could lead to even greater virus transmission.  experts say not following social distancing guidelines and not wearing masks at protests over george floyd's death could increase the risk of coronavirus transmission. pictured: activists take part in a black lives matter protest after the floyd's death, june 1  shouting and running around could raise the risk of infected droplets being spewed into the air and others inhaling them. pictured: demonstrators during a protest in new york, may 31  dr william schaffer, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the vanderbilt university medical center, told dailymail.com there are several reasons one may become infected at a protest.  there's the fact that demonstrations are large congregant events - which are currently discouraged - a lack of social distancing and people not wearing masks.  however, he adds that a lot of shouting is also likely to increase the risk of virus spread.  'there is a lot of shouting and running around, which is exertional, which will make people breathe more deeply and exhale more,' schaffner said.  this means more potentially infected droplets in the air and a greater chance of a non-infected person breathing them in and falling ill.  additionally, many people attending these protests are people of color, minorities who have been disproportionately affected by covid.  'that puts those populations at greater risk and those people can bring the virus home with them,' schaffner said.  'there's no doubt that we are concerned that this may contribute to spikes of increased infections here and there because it comes at the time when we are all ""opening our society"" as we are going out.'  on saturday, in los angeles, mayor eric garcetti, warned the protests could become 'super-spreading events' if people don't practice social distancing or take other preventive measures such as wearing masks.  these events occur when a single person, who sheds a great deal of the virus for unknown reasons, infects several people at one time.  schaffner says there have been 'super-spreading' events during the pandemic after large groups of people have come together.  one example is in south korea, where a woman went to china, came back infected and then attended a large event at her church.  'there was a huge are gathering at this religious service where social distancing was not observed even though it was already recommended,' he said.  'and she was indeed a super-spreader and spread it to a large number of people, creating the first major introduction of covid into south korea.'  shouting and running around could raise the risk of infected droplets being spewed into the air and others inhaling them. pictured: protesters rally against the death of george floyd in portland, oregon, may 31  one expert fears the distrust in authority after floyd's death will also lead to a distrust in health authorities who are contact tracing. pictured: nypd anti-riot police are seen preparing to disperse protestors, may 31  in another instance in washington state, after someone ill attended choir practice, 52 of the 61 people there became sick.  according to skagit county public health, 32 were confirmed to have covid-19 and 20 had symptoms consistent with the virus.  schaffner says a super-spreader might not know they're infected and think their coughing is from the protest.  'if you suddenly start coughing, and you've been exposed to tear gas and pepper spray, you may just ascribe your cough to those kinds of exposures rather than attributing them to perhaps covid infection,' he said.  'so they could easily put themselves in a position where they infect a large number of people.'  he also fears than an unintended consequence of floyd's death and the protests will be a distrust of authorities that spills into contact tracing.  contact tracing is considered to be one of the most important measures needed to safely reopen the economy.  all covid-19 positive patients are asked to remember everyone they came into contact with while possibly contagious, and then those people are asked to self-quarantine for two weeks.  'contact tracing only works if there is trust,' schaffner explained.  'a total stranger calls you up, you're positive, explains they're from the health department, wants to contact everyone with whom you've had contact with in the previous week.  'unless you trust that person and believe that they were trying do good for your community and your friends, you won’t give up that information.  schaffner says 'if one wishes to demonstrate', remember to socially distance from others, always wear a mask covering the nose and mouth and bring hand sanitizer.  he also advises to go home during the evening.  'because it would appear that all the rambunctiousness occurs once it gets dark and obviously with all the running around and congregating then, that's when the risk increases,' he added."
health,"***have you been contacted by a covid-19 nhs tracer? email stephen.matthews@mailonline.co.uk or ring 020 361 51181***  prime minister's spokesman refused to reveal how many people contacted so far  there are 25,000 contact tracers who have been hired across the uk  some report being unable to get through basic training because of glitches  staff unable to start work say they have been told they 'will be paid anyway'  the government's coronavirus test and trace system remains in chaos today with staff battling against a failing operating system and unable to start work.  people working in the system, which was supposed to be fully operational by june 1, say they have not contacted anyone in the two weeks since they started work.  and employees say they are having to repeat training they have already done because glitches in the system mean they cannot register that they have completed it already.  those keen to get started say they have been sat twiddling their thumbs and they have been stuck in queues of over 350 people waiting for technical help.  sent laughing emojis by bosses who can't help them, contact tracers say the system remains 'shambolic' and unfit for purpose as millions of pupils return to school today.  other lockdown rules have lifted this week, and people are now allowed to meet outdoors in groups of up to six people and outdoor businesses may reopen.  but there are concerns the test and trace won't work if britons refuse to give friends or relatives' details, and one call handler revealed two of the three potentially infected contacts she rang went straight to voicemail.  one source, who has been employed by sitel since may 13 was today still waiting to make their first call while earning £75-a-day for doing nothing.  experts say the success of the project is crucial to banishing the virus from our lives and a 25,000-strong army of 'test and trace' call-handlers have been recruited by companies like sitel and serco for the task.  the source, who is based in the west midlands, said: 'each day we login and it's the same thing over and over again. we ask what we are going to be doing today only to be told to hold tight and chill out and, ""you're still getting paid"".'  it is the latest development in a string of mis-steps over the past week as the system has been set up, with some staff saying they were only told the night before that it would start.  the prime minister's spokesman this afternoon refused to reveal how many people the programme had contacted so far, but said it would be 'published shortly'.  in a chat where staff discussed technical problems one of the senior moderators said 'surprise surprise, another technical glitch', accompanied by laughing face emojis  staff report having to wait in queues of hundreds to get technical support for an operating system that doesn't work  the contact tracer, who declined to be named, said: 'it is so chaotic. you complete the online training but that doesn't register on the system.  'you can have a problem with a log-in to one of the many different systems we are using and you are put in a queue with upwards of 300 people for help.  'i like to be productive when i'm supposed to be in work but the various technical situations have prevented it.  'we had to complete online training but when we completed it, the system didn't register that we had done it.'  text messages seen by mailonline show the frustration being felt.  in one a group moderator writes: 'no seriously, i know its crazy but if you have done all the training then there isn't much more you can do at the moment until they give you more training.  'so use this time to chill, your still getting payed so cant complain. you wont have this chilled time when we go live so enjoy (smiley face).'  in another message the same moderator says: 'guys, i understand the frustration but may (sic) of the systems are currently down. kronos being one of them so many people cannot log in, i appreciate this is very annoying. they have told me that clients will be payed (sic) anyway even if you cannot log into kronos to stamp your time.'  one in ten britons will ignore self isolation rules at least 10 per cent of britons will ignore requests to self-isolate when contacted by nhs covid tracers, a health chief has warned. professor isabel oliver helped design the government's tracing app to track those who are at risk of being infected. the director of the field epidemiology service at public health england told the sunday telegraph that though most people are willing to comply, a minority will disobey instructions. it is thought that lockdown fatigue will cause people to ignore advice offered to them. 'this has been a very prolonged outbreak,' she said. 'invariably we find that everyone is very willing to help, but these are exceptional circumstances, with an outbreak that has been so prolonged and had such an extensive impact on the people's lives, so it is understanding that some people will be resistant. 'but having said that we are finding that lots of people are supportive and we are very grateful for that because for the programme to be successful in controlling the virus - we need that support from the nation as a whole.' test and trace launched in england on thursday and professor oliver's team immediately hit a wall of it problems. but she stressed that any delays to having tracers logged in was down to the fact that the app is run on a 'very secure system'. advertisement  responding to staff saying they have completed their training but it is not being acknowledged by the system, the moderator replies: 'don't worry. ive heard its coming up like that for everyone. surprise, surprise another tech glitch (4 laughing faces).'  warnings have had to be issued to bored staff telling them not to use the calling software to make personal calls.  they were warned: 'it is worthwhile mentioning that 100 per cent of calls are monitored through a speech analytics software system. absolutely nothing can fall through the net in that regard.  'i cannot begin to advise what sort of conversations we have listened to since this programme started but needless to say they are not all appropriate.'  the source went on: 'now most of us have been cleared to make calls but are finding there is no data on the system or if they do get through it's to a person who has already been contacted multiple times.  'meanwhile our bosses have told us to expect things to get 'very busy' if a second peak of the virus occurs.'  when the calls start in earnest, the handlers, paid around £9-an-hour will read from a script designed to enforce the government's measures.  these mean that anyone listed as a recent 'contact' of someone who has tested positive for the virus must immediately self-isolate for 14 days.  but those receiving the calls are not obliged to co-operate and if they refuse, staff must attempt to read out a statement: 'following up contacts will enable us to check that the individuals are well, to provide them with advice if they are unwell or if they become unwell and will also help us to protect your friends, family, the community and nhs by containing the spread of the virus.  'thank you for taking the time to speak to me. if you need any further information, please visit our website at www.gov.uk/coronavirus.'  the script, seen by mailonline, takes staff through various scenarios they may face when trying to make telephone contact with someone needing to self-isolate.  if they obtain consent for the call, they take the 'contact' through a questionnaire concerning their personal and contact details as well as their state of health.  people are not obliged to give over these details although it is explained that it can help to divert them to local support services.  the key message is that they must, 'immediately self-isolate at home for 14 days from the date of their last contact' with the infected person.  they will then have the message reiterated: 'stay at home for 14 days. do not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis.'  if they develop symptoms they should arrange for a test online if possible or by ringing the nhs on 119.  other people sharing a house with those contacted do not have to self-isolate unless the contact is already showing symptoms in which case they must.  things are more difficult if you live with somebody who is shielding having received a letter from the government.  in that scenario you will be told: 'where possible, move anyone who is clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of your home isolation period.  'if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible.'  an internal chat seen by the daily mail says, 'people are also panicking as there is no information on the websites/systems for them to make the calls'  if the person being asked to isolate lives on their own then the caller asks if they will need help with provisions. if they have internet access, they are told to visit their local authority website and if they don't the caller finds a number for local support and passes it on.  but before any of these messages can be delivered, call handlers must first sensitively plot their way to a consensual call with the correct person, knowing that they are powerless should those on the end of the line object.  britain abandoned test and trace in march because it could only handle five new cases per week britain abandoned test and tracing for the coronavirus earlier in the pandemic because the system could only cope with five cases a week, it has emerged. official documents from the government's sage advisory committee reveal that the routine testing and tracing of contacts of people with the virus was stopped because public health england was facing a desperate shortage of capacity. since the first covid-19 cases were confirmed in york on january 31, 272,826 people in the uk have since tested positive for the virus. this week the government launched the nhs england's test and trace programme, with 25,000 contact tracing staff and the capacity to trace the 10,000 contacts per day. the decision to scrap routine testing for those displaying symptoms 12 weeks ago is now being seen as a major factor for how the uk has the fifth-highest total number of infections. sage documents show how, in a meeting on february 18, advisors said that public health england (phe) could only manage the contacts of five covid cases a week, hoping to possibly increase this to 50 people. minutes from the meeting say: 'currently phe can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).  barriers include a contact who can't speak english, concerns over the authenticity of the call, concerns over privacy and data and an answerphone.  the script tells the call-handlers how to handle each situation, something many of them are sadly yet to experience.  the government insisted yesterday that the system was running efficiently and had the capacity to handle 10,000 new cases per day.  for comparison, statistics suggest fewer than 8,000 brits are being struck down each day.  boris johnson said the programme would be 'world beating' but evidence suggests the contact-tracing army has been left ill-prepared and, in many cases, workers have nothing to do – at a cost to the taxpayer of £1.6million per day.  on a public facebook group for clinical contact tracers, several reported spending most of their shifts waiting to be assigned cases through the system, called ctas.  it is supposed to show the patients assigned to a tracer along with unassigned cases that can be picked up.  one tracer said he had not had any cases on saturday, while another said two of three calls she made went straight to voicemail, the times reports.  one of the 3,000 clinical case workers hired by public health england said she had completed three four-hour shifts, at £27-an-hour, but hadn't made any calls yet. she told the times: 'i have had absolutely nothing to do.'  the nurse said she had seen 'zero cases' on the system throughout three shifts and felt 'tremendously guilty about doing the shifts and being paid and not having anything to do really'.  'it's very obviously not ready,' she said. 'something is not working between ctas and the test results that are coming in.'  another contact tracer said he was still waiting for login details to access training, and said the system had been 'chaotic'.  his job as a 'tier three' call handler should be to ring the contacts of positive cases and tell them to self-isolate and curb the potential spread of covid-19.  details of those who test positive are passed to a company called sitel, which is running the track and trace handling across the uk.  agents read from a prepared script when they are given the name and telephone number of a person who has been diagnosed with covid-19.  they ask for the details of friends and family the infected person has come into contact with during the previous two weeks.  the tracing agent then makes contact with those on their list and informs them they have to self-isolate.  one tracer said colleagues who were on shift were 'sitting there all day waiting and just refreshing their screens'. he said: 'they've got nothing to do.'  mailonline has contacted the department of health for comment."
health,"having sex could spread the coronavirus - and only abstinence or masturbating are low risk, scientists have warned.  doctors at harvard university in boston have ranked different sexual scenarios based on how likely someone is to catch the coronavirus.  the most risky was having multiple sexual partners from different households, while the least risky was avoiding sex until the virus has disappeared.  they admitted that abstaining from sex was 'not feasible for many' and that doctors should be prepared to discuss how to minimise the risk of patients catching covid-19 during sex.  avoiding kissing, wearing masks, and showering before and after sex could reduce the risk of catching the virus, they said.  while phone sex or sexting could be suitable for adults, the researchers warned it could lead to other problems such as blackmail, and that online sexual predation had increased during the pandemic.  in their study, published in the journal annals of internal medicine, the team ranked sexual scenarios in the following order of risk:  abstinence - no sexual contact of any kind. behaviour adds no risk of infection, 'though unfeasible for many'. masturbation - 'low risk for infection'. sexual activity on digital platforms - low risk for infection but potential for online abuse, legal complications arising from screenshots, not suitable for minors because of the potential for abuse or illegality. sex with people within household - high risk of infection if partner catches the virus outside of the home. sex with people from other households - high risk of infection, especially if there are multiple partners.  the uk government, as it lifted some strict lockdown rules today, clarified that any physical contact - including sex - with someone who you don't live with is still against the rules.  and a study of 900 adults in britain found only four out of 10 have had sex since the start of lockdown, with young married couples most likely to have done so.  lockdown rules in britain prevent anyone from having sex with someone who doesn't live in their home. a survey found only four out of 10 british adults have been sexually active since the lockdown started in may (stock image)  researchers at harvard university in boston said abstinence (no sex) or masturbation were the lowest risk option, but that there were measures couples could take to try and prevent the spread of the virus, including wearing masks and avoiding kissing  guidance issued by british officials today said: 'close contact with people from other households means a much higher risk of transmission, and according to the scientific advice, we cannot safely allow people to see people they don't live with indoors without the risk that the virus will spread.  'we recognise how difficult this is for people - particularly those who live alone and we are keeping this under constant review.'  some users on twitter joked that the rule seems only to apply to sex indoors - not outdoors.  but people are still prohibited from coming within two metres (6'6"") of anyone who doesn't live in their household.  researchers do not know yet whether the coronavirus can infect people from semen or vaginal fluids if someone has sex with a person infected with the virus. no studies have managed to prove the virus is present and infectious in sexual fluids.  the close contact inevitable in sex, however, means people would be at high risk of catching the virus when it was airborne or on a surface which both people touched.  swiss brothels can reopen after sex workers list 'safe' positions that won't spread covid swiss brothels have been given the green light to open on june 6 as the country exits lockdown, with strict health rules including keeping your faces 'one forearm length apart' during sex. doggy style and reverse cowgirl are the two positions which would comply with the new rule - but threesomes are out and 'anal practices' will require gloves. anonymity is also a thing of the past because clients' personal details will have to be kept for four weeks in case they are needed for contact tracing. rules drawn up by a sex workers' group also call for masks to be worn if possible and bed sheets to be washed after each client departs to stop the spread of coronavirus. prostitution has been legal in switzerland since 1942 and industry group prokore has been lobbying the government to let it restart as soon as possible. their wish was granted when the swiss health ministry put 'erotic business' on a list of activities which could resume on june 6. prokore has already drawn up an exhaustive list of rules to be distributed to individual brothels and agreed with sex workers. 'during sex, positions should be used in which the transmission of droplets is low,' the guidelines say, referring to the small particles thought to spread the virus. 'there will be no services with close facial contact. there must be a distance of at least one forearm length between the two people.' the rules continue: 'services involving two or more clients will not be offered. 'wearing a mouth and nose covering is recommended for all services. anal practices will only take place with gloves.' the rules also say that rooms used by prostitutes should be aired for at least 15 minutes between each encounter. bed sheets should be washed at 140f (60c) after each client has finished, and both the client and sex worker should ideally have a shower before and afterwards. in addition, 'all clients are made aware that contact details will be recorded and kept for four weeks for the purpose of contact tracing'. the guidelines also apply to cars, which could have their numberplates recorded in order to ensure that infected clients can be tracked down later. advertisement  harvard experts, led by dr jack turban, said in a paper aimed at doctors: 'patient[s] should be counseled on the risk for infection from partners.'  admitting that telling people not to have any sex was unlikely to work, the team suggested risk-reducing measures.  these measures included avoiding a partner if they had coronavirus symptoms, no kissing, or activities that involved contact with faeces, urine or semen.  they suggested couples could consider wearing masks, showering before and after sex, and disinfecting the area where they had sex afterwards.    dr jack turban and colleagues said: 'data are lacking regarding routes of sexual transmission.  'two small studies of sars-cov-2–infected people did not detect virus in semen or vaginal secretions...  'moreover, these data are moot, given that any in-person contact results in substantial risk for disease transmission owing to the virus' stability on common surfaces and propensity to propagate in the [throat] and respiratory tract.'  they said studies had suggested urine and faeces could be contaminated by the coronavirus but it wasn't clear if they were infectious.  dr turban and his colleagues said the public was almost certain not to follow a rule that tried to stop them from having sex.  they said: 'for the population at large, a recommendation of long-term sexual abstinence is unlikely to be effective, given the well-documented failures of abstinence-based public health interventions and their likelihood to promote shame.'  a survey by scientists at the universities of anglia ruskin, in cambridge, and ulster in northern ireland, found that only 39.9 per cent of brits say they have been sexually active during lockdown.  the research showed six out of 10 people in the uk have not had sex for more than two months, since the strict social distancing rules were imposed.  partners who do not live together have been driven apart by the rules, not allowed within 2m of one another unless they hastily moved in together after the announcement.  younger married couples were the group most likely to still be sexually active, the study found.  the scientists said it was a concern because regular sex can improve people's heart and brain health, as well as their mental wellbeing.  dr lee smith said: 'when starting this research we expected there to be a high level of sexual activity while social isolating at home, but interestingly we found a very low level.  'this low level of sexual activity could be explained by people currently feeling anxious and stressed owing to the pandemic and not being in the mood to engage in the act.  'moreover, those who are not married or cohabiting may not currently be able to meet up with their sexual partners and similarly those who use online apps to facilitate casual sex will currently not be able to do this.  'a lot of my previous research has shown that a frequent and trouble-free sex life is important for higher levels of enjoyment of life and general mental health, and this is particularly true for older adults.  'however, this study showed that older adults were less likely than younger adults to engage in sexual activity.'  dr lee's study was published in the journal of sexual medicine."
health,"coronavirus patients could be left short of breath for months after their battle with the disease, according to government scientists.  sage, a panel of exerts who advise number 10 in emergencies, also warned covid-19 survivors may endure weeks of fatigue.  concerns about the lasting effects of the illness were discussed in a sage meeting which took place on may 7.  boris johnson raised fears for his health in his first downing street briefing after he was discharged from intensive care following his bout of covid-19.  the prime minister leaned on his lectern with both arms and his opening remarks on april 30 were punctuated by strained inhalations.  other brits who have fought off the virus have revealed throughout the outbreak that they have been wiped of energy and left struggling to walk up the stairs.  boris johnson was bereft of his characteristic ebullience on april 30, during a strained first downing street briefing since his period of intensive care for coronavirus  scientists are currently clueless as to how long it takes infected patients to fully recover from covid-19, which has killed 370,000 people worldwide.  the more serious someone's illness is, the longer it takes, and those who end up in intensive care may be left with permanent damage to their lungs and liver.  physiotherapists also warn patients can suffer a loss of mobility, if they are stuck on hospital wards for weeks, or endure flashbacks and emotional distress.  scientists think it is likely people become immune to the virus in at least the short term, meaning they won't catch it twice, but they are not certain.  sage called for studies to investigate the lasting effects of the illness, which some experts have branded 'post-covid disability' and likened to polio.  how long does it take to recover from coronavirus? doctors say it's unclear how long it takes people to truly recover from covid-19, however anecdotal evidence suggests it can take months. indeed, when the prime minister was rushed to intensive care, experts issued grave warnings about how long he would be out of action for. one medical precept holds that for every week a patient is in intensive care, there will require double that time to fully recover once discharged. the more serious someone's illness is, the longer it takes, and those who end up in intensive care may be left with permanent damage to their lungs and liver. scientists think it is likely people become immune to the virus in at least the short term, meaning they won't catch it twice, but they are not certain. covid-19 is caused by a virus which mainly attaches to and attacks cells in the lining of the airways and the lungs, which is why sufferers find it so difficult to breathe. the body's immune reaction is what causes symptoms - swelling in the areas where the virus is attacking makes the airways close up and make it hard to breathe, and patients cough to try and expel the viruses and dead lung tissue from their bodies. the immune system also causes a high temperature and aches and pains as it tries to make the body too hostile for it to survive. and patients become exhausted as the virus makes the lungs unable to get enough oxygen into the blood, depleting muscles' energy supplies. while the vast majority of people who catch the coronavirus survive - some with medical help, but many without - the effects of it can linger on for weeks afterwards. advertisement  officials published a trove of meetings and scientific papers on friday, laying bare the advice ministers were given during the crisis.  minutes from the meeting on may 7 read: 'sage also noted the existence of longer-term health sequelae.'  this, the team said, included the 'persistence of extreme tiredness and shortness of breath for several months'.  advisers also warned of rare symptoms such as strokes and kidney disease, both of which have been linked to covid-19.  one scientific advisor to the government told the telegraph 'a very high proportion' of covid-19 survivors 'cannot get back to a normal life'.  the meeting was attended 50 people, including sir patrick vallance and professor chris whitty - number 10's most senior advisers.  seven observers and government officials also attended - but the names of four of them were hidden.  the boss of nhs england last week warned the uk was seeing a 'substantial new need for rehab and aftercare'.  sir simon stevens revealed some patients need psychological treatment for 'post-intensive care syndrome'.  his comments came as the nhs launched its first hospital to help patients recover from the long-term effects of the illness.  more than 100 staff were recruited to work at the seacole centre in leatherhead, surrey, which opened its doors on friday.  physiotherapists fear a 'tsunami of demand' in the wake of the pandemic, with one group saying it was 'incredibly worried' about a post-covid spike.  sage met for the first time in january as a 'precautionary' measure, 22 days after the virus was reported in china.  the committee noted testing capacity in wuhan was already 'overwhelmed' and said there is evidence of person-to-person transmission.  they also talked about the then lack of evidence on whether patients can spread the virus before showing symptoms and what the viral incubation period is."
health,"a blood thinning drug and experimental cancer treatment pill are among five drugs which will be trialled on covid-19 patients in nhs hospitals.  the medications are part of the first wave to be selected from a list of 200 potential candidates, and will each be tested on dozens of hospitalised patients.  if proven to be effective, officials will fast-track them into larger coronavirus trials in the uk involving thousands of brits infected with coronavirus.  one of the drugs is heparin, a blood-thinner used to treat heart attacks and hoped to stop blood-clotting observed in critically-ill covid-19 patients.  scientists also hope zilucoplan, produced by belgian firm ucb, will reduce damage to healthy lung tissue caused by the virus.  the department of health had already revealed compounds bemcetinib, medi3506 and acalabrutinib were involved in the trial.  a total of six drugs will initially enter the programme - but the sixth drug has not yet been revealed.  british-norwegian biopharma company bergenbio's bemcentinib was the first drug to be selected to go into phase 2 studies  heparin, a blood-thinning agent used on the nhs in products such as fragmin, will be given to covid-19 patients for the first time next month  thirty nhs hospitals across britain will be involved in the accord study, which was approved to begin at the end of april.  the university of southampton-led trial aims to give an early indication of whether a drug is effective in treating hospitalised coronavirus patients.  once proven successful, the drugs can enter larger clinical trials such as recovery - currently the world's largest randomised trial run by oxford scientists.  calquence is a medication for a type of non-hodgkin lymphoma known as mantle cell lymphoma but has the potential to dampen the body's aggressive immune response to covid-19  'we are looking for a signal of both safety and efficacy, something that could reduce the severity of the disease, shorten its duration and prevent patients going into the intensive care environment,' tom wilkinson, accord's academic lead told the guardian.  the respiratory medicine professor and consultant, from the nihr southampton biomedical research centre, said: 'these are small, rapidly deliverable studies if we get patients in so we’re looking only to achieve around 60 patients for each arm of the trial to receive one of the drugs compared to usual standard of care.'  nhs hospitals that have signed up include st thomas’ and guy's in london - where boris johnson was treated - and major hospitals in liverpool, manchester, leeds, leicester and glasgow.  british-norwegian biopharma company bergenbio's bemcentinib was the first drug to be selected to go into the phase two study – the stage of a clinical trial focused on the testing of a drug on patients to assess how effective it is and side effects.  the once-a-day pill, originally developed for cancer, is hoped to defend against coronavirus by stopping it from entering cells and preventing it 'switching off' one of the body’s most important antiviral defence mechanisms.  bergenbio chief executive richard godfrey told the mail on sunday that he was ‘extremely optimistic’ the pill would save lives. ‘i think there’s an 80 per cent probability of it working and being of benefit to patients,’ he said.  the results of a trial of 120 patients at southampton general hospital are expected at the end of june.  laboratory studies by the university of iowa found the pill could boost immune response and switch off axl receptors, which when turned on, allow the virus to enter and multiply in lung cells.  the department of health revealed one of the others being looked at is acalabrutinib, the generic name for calquence, produced by astrazeneca.  what other drugs are being tested? only limited numbers of people can be enrolled in trials and only certain people - usually otherwise healthy patients - are eligible for them. for those who do make it onto trials there is often still a 50/50 chance that they get a placebo - a fake drug - anyway. these are some of the medicines being trialled on covid-19 patients in the uk: lopinavir-ritonavir (normally used to treat hiv)  dexamethasone (a steroid)  azithromycin (pneumonia; lyme disease; chlamydia)  tocilizumab (rheumatoid arthritis)  hydroxychloroquine (malaria prevention; lupus; rheumatoid arthritis)  convalescent plasma (blood from a recovered patient) advertisement  calquence is a medication for a type of non-hodgkin lymphoma known as mantle cell lymphoma but has the potential to dampen the body's aggressive immune response to covid-19.  a small study of the drug at the walter reed general hospital in washington showed 'some clinical benefit' against covid-19.  jose baselga, of astrazeneca, the company which will produce billions of doses of oxford university's experimental vaccine, told forbes the effects of calquence 'are clear'.  officials have revealed medi3506, also produced by medimmune, a subsidiary of cambridge-based astrazeneca, will be involved in the accord trial.  it has been dished out in early trials for eczema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) - a crippling lung condition.  it works by dampening down an over-reaction of the immune system, which can be prompted by the body reacting to the coronavirus.  heparin, a blood-thinning agent used on the nhs, will be given to covid-19 patients for the first time next month, the guardian reported.  dr wilkinson claimed that it can have a 'dramatic effect in the lung' as the 'big sticky molecules can attach to viruses and stop them from entering cells'.  the compound, used in drugs such as fragmin to prevent blood clots, may also be useful for critically ill covid-19 patients who are at risk of blockages.  doctors say blood clots are responsible for a large amount of coronavirus deaths - even after a patient is discharged from hospital.  other studies have shown abnormal blood-clotting in covid-19 patients results in a significantly increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.  experts hope a fifth drug, called zilucoplan, will stop the overreaction of the immune system, which can lead to the death of healthy lung tissue.  'a lot of the damage is focused on the blood cells and the very small blood vessels in the lung,' dr wilkinson said.  ucb's drug - originally given to treat a skeleto-muscular disorder called myasthenia gravis - is injected under the skin.  mailonline has contacted the department of health and social care for details of the sixth drug that is being tested.  british scientists are hoping hundreds of patients will sing up for trials of medicines which will speed up the race for a cure.  it comes just days after global studies - including britain's landmark recovery trial - of hydroxychloroquine were halted.  concerns about the donald trump-touted medicine were raised in a scientific paper published in the lancet, that found it raised the risk of death and had no benefit.  recovery also looks at antibiotic azithromycin, steroid dexamethasone, hiv drug lopinavir-ritonavir, and an anti-inflammatory called tocilizumab."
health,"protestors involved in the backlash against the death of american man george floyd risk catching coronavirus while demonstrating in the street, officials fear.  as the us yesterday went through another day of violent rioting and protests broke out in london, manchester and cardiff, there are concerns the mass gatherings could trigger new waves of covid-19.  many places where protests have emerged are still under covid-19 lockdown rules banning large crowds but police have been unable to contain them.  the coronavirus spreads fastest when people are in close contact with one another and politicians have urged those taking part to try and keep social distancing, to wash their hands and to get tested for the virus afterwards.  many protestors have been photographed ignoring social distancing rules and not wearing any protective gear such as masks or goggles - but a scientist has warned that shouting is likely to increase the risk of virus transmission even more.  demonstrations are also attracting large numbers of black and ethnic minority people, who are dying of covid-19 in greater numbers than white people.  officials in the us warned people to protect themselves and others and said they fear a surge in cases and deaths in a couple of weeks' time.  the protests, now happening all over the world, were triggered after a white policeman in minnesota killed george floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest after mr floyd allegedly used counterfeit money. the 46-year-old was heard gasping 'i can't breathe' before his death.  trafalgar square, london: hundreds of demonstrators packed into trafalgar square on sunday, chanting 'i can't breathe,' the words floyd was heard gasping as a white police officer knelt on his neck in minneapolis. government rules still prohibit people from deliberately gathering in groups larger than six people, and stipulate people must stay 2m away from others at all times  london's metropolitan police warned on twitter yesterday that 'government restrictions to control the spread of coronavirus remain in place'  why are crowds a coronavirus risk? social distancing is arguably the world's greatest weapon against the coronavirus because of the way it spreads. the virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets - that means it piggy-backs on drops of moisture that are carried on someone's breath. they break free into the air when someone infected with covid-19 exhales, coughs, sneezes, spits or wipes their nose. the closer an uninfected person is to the source of these droplets, the more likely they are to get infected. in a crowd, a single infected person can infect many others just because them come into close contact with them so rapidly. protests may carry extra risk because shouting can carry more droplets out of someone's mouth. dr saskia popescu, an infectious disease expert at george mason university in fairfax, virginia, told the washington post: 'shouting and screaming, as some studies have shown with singing, can project droplets farther, which makes the use of masks [and eye protection] that much more important.' scientists are divided over how well banning mass gatherings prevents the spread of the virus. in a paper presented to sage, the british government's scientific advisory committee, experts said that mass gatherings may be a smaller risk than pubs and restaurants because people attend them infrequently and generally don't directly interact with many people. advertisement  statistics last week showed that around 8,000 people per day are still catching the coronavirus in britain - some 54,000 people each week.  scientists have voiced concerns about the government's plans to start easing lockdown this week, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet.  they say the virus is still circulating at dangerous levels in the community and too much social freedom could trigger another outbreak.  huge crowds like those which formed in london, manchester and cardiff over the weekend could be a fertile breeding ground for the coronavirus if people attending are carrying the bug.  london's metropolitan police warned on twitter yesterday: 'government restrictions to control the spread of coronavirus remain in place.  'police are encouraging our communities to comply with the regulations to keep everyone as safe as possible.'  protesting might have a particularly strong effect on raising the risk of virus spreading between people there, if they are infected, one scientist said.  dr saskia popescu, an infectious disease expert at george mason university in fairfax, virginia, told the washington post: 'crowded protests, like any large gathering of people in a close space, can help facilitate the spread of covid-19, which is why it’s so important participants wear masks, eye protection and bring hand-gel.  'shouting and screaming, as some studies have shown with singing, can project droplets farther, which makes the use of masks [and eye protection] that much more important.'  public figures in the us, where protesting is much more widespread and more than 100,000 people have died of covid-19 this year, have directly warned protestors.  the mayor of washington dc, where fires have been lit outside of the white house, said people ignoring social distancing risk 'compounding' the impact of the virus.  mayor muriel bowser said: 'i'm concerned that we had mass gatherings on our streets when we just lifted a stay at home order and what that could mean for spikes in coronavirus cases later.  'in fact, i'm so concerned about it that i'm urging everybody to consider their exposure — if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested — because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve.'  london, england: people carrying banners gather during a protest over the death of george floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white police officer in usa  downing street, london, england: armed police officers guard the gates of downing street where hundreds of protesters were seen holding placards, as well as an antifa (anti-fascist) flag  she added: 'and while i saw some people with masks last night, others didn't,' nbc reports.  'i saw some people social distancing, other people were right on top of each other.  'so we don't want to compound this deadly virus and the impact it's had on our community.'  governor of maryland, larry hogan, said: 'there's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets, is — it's not healthy.  he added: 'two weeks from now across america, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.'  ethnic minority patients make up disproportionate covid-19 deaths in uk in nhs hospitals in england, black people have so far made up a disproportionate of covid-19 victims. scientists do not understand why, whether there are biological reasons such as higher rates of diabetes, or whether more bame people have caught the virus because they are more likely to live and work in densely populated cities. white people account for 76% of all coronavirus deaths in nhs england hospitals, while they make up 86% of the population. people of asian ethnicity - which includes south asian countries such as india, bangladesh and pakistan - make up 7% of the covid-19 deaths and 7.5% of the population. b lack people have accounted for 5% of all coronavirus deaths but just 3.3% of the general population. mixed race people, meanwhile, account for 1% of deaths and 2.2% of the population. sources: nhs england/gov.uk  data shows that black people and those of asian ethnicity are dying of covid-19 at a faster rate than white people.  nhs england data shows that 14 per cent of all people who have died with the coronavirus in its hospitals have been black or asian.  but they only make up around 11 per cent of the population of the country, showing they are dying at a disproportionate rate.  white people, however, compose 76 per cent of deaths but 86 per cent of the population.  and data from the us shows that african-american people are dying are more than double the rate of white people.  the apm research lab published findings in may showing that, nationwide, black americans were dying of the coronavirus at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people, the guardian reported.  white people were dying a significantly lower rate - 20.7 per 100,000 - and the rates for latin americans and those of asian ethnicity were 22.9 and 22.7, respectively.  more than 20,000 black americans had died by the time the statistics were released and some individual states had even greater differences between ethnicities.  in kansas black people were dying at seven times the rate of whites, while the ratio was six-to-one in washington and five-to-one in michigan and missouri.  this is of concern because the george floyd protests - linked to the black lives matter movement - are attracting large numbers of people from ethnic minorities.  the protests hinge on the treatment of black crime suspects by white police officers in the us.  minneapolis police officer derek chauvin has been charged with the murder of george floyd after kneeling on his neck and ignoring the man's desperate pleas for help as he said he couldn't breathe.  mr floyd had been arrested for allegedly using counterfeit money and then refusing to hand back the cigarettes he'd bought when asked by the shopkeeper, the bbc reported.  the mayor of atlanta, georgia, where more than half of the population is black, said: 'if you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a covid test this week.  'there is still a pandemic in america that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.'"
health,"as lockdown gradually begins to ease, we are now at increased risk of picking up the virus and bringing it into our homes, so it's never been more important to take steps to ensure your home is kept meticulously virus-free to minimise your chance of spreading infection among other members of your household. from filling your fridge with immunity bolstering foods to throwing open windows and regularly wiping your mobile phone, we show you how to ensure that your home remains a safe, covid-free zone.  kitchen  cleaning  disinfect surfaces which are touched frequently (door handles and kitchen counters).  you can wipe down with a diluted bleachbased disinfectant, but an alcoholbased cleaner or soapy water can be as effective because soap breaks down and destroys the virus's outer shell.  cleaning cloths and sponges are not likely to be covid-carriers, but they are the biggest reservoir of microbes in your whole house. so wash them in a bleach-based disinfectant.  from filling your fridge with immunity bolstering foods to throwing open windows and regularly wiping your mobile phone, we show you how to ensure that your home remains a safe, covid-free zone  shopping  ordering a food delivery is a safer option than going to a supermarket — but it's not entirely risk-free.  if the person who collected your order has contaminated hands, the virus could transfer on to your food packaging.  however, the coronavirus does not replicate outside the body, so by the time your food is delivered, it is likely to have become less infectious.  we also have good evidence that just ten minutes in the sunshine kills most viruses on most surfaces, so you might want to leave packages in the sun for a short while.  if you do go to a supermarket, wear a mask.  try to avoid touching your face as you shop and, if you are driving, give your hands a wipe when you leave the shop.  disinfect surfaces which are touched frequently (door handles and kitchen counters)  cups & plates  if someone in your household becomes ill, keep a separate set of plates and cutlery for them and wash these separately.  washing clothes  the virus can survive for two to three days, indoors, on plastic and stainless steel, but it doesn't live anything like as long on porous fabric surfaces (such as clothes and furnishings).  the holes in textiles trap the coronavirus and prevent it being transferred so easily.  even so, hygiene experts i've spoken to recommend washing clothes more than we normally would.  if you are concerned you might have been in contact with an infected person, then wash your clothes at 60c.  be careful not to shake the clothes before putting them in the machine as this could disperse virus particles.  if someone in your household becomes ill, keep a separate set of plates and cutlery for them and wash these separately  disposable masks should be binned after use, and home-made masks put in the wash after every use.  fridge  make sure to empty your fridge of tempting sugary snacks which contribute to weight gain.  being overweight significantly increases your risk of complications if you do get covid-19.  instead, top it up with immunity-bolstering foods.  our favourites include red peppers, which contain three times as much vitamin c as an orange. also try live yoghurt and oily fish.  the virus can, theoretically, last 24 hours on cardboard, but post and packages are not considered a high-risk route of transmission  entrance hall  outdoor clothes  if you do a high-risk job, such as nursing, or you are a taxi driver, you might want to put a box by your front door for outdoor shoes and jackets.  this means you can remove potentially infected outer clothing as soon as you return home.  post  the virus can, theoretically, last 24 hours on cardboard, but post and packages are not considered a high-risk route of transmission.  ask the person delivering them to keep their distance, wash your hands after opening, and then throw packaging away.  mobiles  unlike hands — which are, hopefully, regularly washed — almost three-quarters of people have never cleaned their phone.  a study in the journal of travel medicine and infectious disease found that 68 per cent of mobile phones are contaminated with viruses and bacteria, including some phones that were harbouring antibiotic-resistant bugs.  unlike hands — which are, hopefully, regularly washed — almost three-quarters of people have never cleaned their phone  the report concluded that our mobile phones could be having a 'large and largely unacknowledged impact on spreading infection in the community'.  apple recommends clorox disinfecting wipes, but anything that contains more than 70 per cent alcohol will be fine. do not use water or bleach.  bags  keep your bag on your lap when using public transport.  wipe down your purse or wallet regularly with an alcohol-based wipe, and wash or sanitise your hands before applying lip balm or make-up on the move to avoid introducing germs that may have settled on those items into your eyes or mouth.  keep any food in a bag or sealed box, and wash or sanitise hands before eating.  although the risk of picking up or transferring the virus on a bank card is low, it's a good idea to wipe cards once a week.  wipe down your purse or wallet regularly with an alcohol-based wipe, and wash or sanitise your hands before applying lip balm or make-up on the move to avoid introducing germs that may have settled on those items into your eyes or mouth  downstairs loo  now we can entertain outside, there may be the need for family or friends to use the loo.  wipe all surfaces, including flush levers and taps, with bleach solution or disinfectant spray before guests arrive and change the hand towel.  do the same again when they leave, washing hand towels at 60c. there's no need to clean the loo each time it's used.  bedroom  windows  open windows/doors whenever possible. government advice says the virus is less likely to be passed on in well-ventilated buildings and outdoors.  now it is warmer, leave windows and doors open.  virus droplets quickly disperse in fresh air, and smaller particles which float in the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed will dry more quickly if there's a breeze.  rubbish  if someone in your house is ill, ask them to put any tissues or wipes in a rubbish bag and tie the top. keep this separate from other waste for 72 hours before putting in the household waste bin.  sweeter dreams  wash sheets regularly at 60c (90c for whites).  if someone in your house has symptoms, ask them to put dirty bed linen and towels in a bag and wait 72 hours before washing it.  leave clean linen outside their room. wash hands after touching items from their room  sitting room  tv remotes  just like your mobile phone, a tv remote and gaming handsets can harbour bugs, so give them an occasional wipe with disinfectant.  house plants  i love having house plants around and there is evidence that they can improve the quality of air in any room.  there's even a hit list of top 'air cleaning' plants devised by scientists at nasa who found that house plants are not only good at absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, but can remove volatile organic pollutants from the air, such as benzene and xylene, found in furnishings, cleaning products and air fresheners.  just like your mobile phone, a tv remote and gaming handsets can harbour bugs, so give them an occasional wipe with disinfectant  english (or common) ivy, snake plants, aloe vera and broadleaf lady palms all made it onto the list. if you have breathing problems, plants are great humidity regulators for our dry, centrally heated homes.  whether the air is dry, or your room tends to be damp, plants help to balance out moisture levels. humidity and good indoor air circulation have been shown to help prevent the spread of viruses.  home office  keyboards and shared laptops and tablets are a potential source of cross-infection, so give them an occasional wipe down. use an alcohol-based wipe or a dry cloth with disinfectant spray.  books, magazines & newspapers  the virus cannot be transmitted on newspapers, but avoid licking a finger when you turn the pages (in case you transfer virus particles that you might have picked up elsewhere into your mouth).  glasses of wine  the odd glass of wine is fine, but drinking too much will impact your immunity (alcohol abuse is connected with an increased incidence of infectious diseases).  the odd glass of wine is fine, but drinking too much will impact your immunity  bathroom  washing hands  the key to protecting your home and your loved ones is to wash your hands thoroughly when you return from being outside.  i'm sure you know the drill by now, but in case you don't, you should lather your hands, rubbing the backs and between fingers, 'scratching' each palm with the nails of the other hand to get soap under the nails.  keep going for 20 seconds (or as long as it takes to sing happy birthday twice). then rinse your hands under clean running water.  i make a point of washing my hands regularly throughout the day (after every trip to the lavatory,

can tell if your weight is creeping up. as well as longterm health problems, being overweight increases your risk of complications from covid19. it's far easier to bring any dietary slips back into line if you monitor your weight.  shower/bath  the virus doesn't cling well to hair, so there's no need to wash your hair after you've been out and about, but do tie back long hair so you're less inclined to touch your face.  shower daily, as normal, but ensure that everyone in the house has their own towel, which is washed regularly at 60c.  if someone in your family contracts the virus, try to confine them to their own bathroom if possible, or be vigilant about wiping all surfaces including taps and the toilet flush with a bleach solution.  as well as longterm health problems, being overweight increases your risk of complications from covid19  be vigilant about wiping all surfaces including taps and the toilet flush with a bleach solution if someone in your family contracts the virus  ... and outside  your car  keep a bottle of hand sanitiser in your glove compartment for on-the-move clean-ups.  a pack of disinfecting wipes is also handy so you can wipe the gear stick and steering wheel, door handles and any commonly used buttons when you return to the car after being out if you or a member of your family might have been in contact with the virus.  this will stop any particles transferring from your hands to the car interior, and being potentially brought into your house with you when you get home.  ideally, don't share a car journey with anyone outside of your close family group unless you absolutely have to.  if you do have to travel with someone else, use a face mask and keep a window open when driving.  according to the office for national statistics, security guards and taxi drivers are the workers most at risk of dying from covid-19. it is hard to keep a safe distance in a car.  a pack of disinfecting wipes is also handy so you can wipe the gear

wearing suntan lotion, it is the best way to top up your vitamin d levels, which are likely to be depleted after a long winter.  vitamin d is important for building and regulating your immune system.  getting a blast of uv light in the morning is also a great way to set your circadian clock, which ensures good restorative sleep.  sunlight, as i mentioned before, is a great way to kill any of the virus that happens to be hanging around on packages or other surfaces, mainly because the ultraviolet end of the light spectrum breaks up its vulnerable genetic material.  so do enjoy the sun, safely, this summer!"
health,"almost 2.5million patients have missed out on vital cancer tests and treatment because of the pandemic.  the nhs faces the shocking backlog of cases as it tries to return to normal – and also cope with new victims of the disease.  cancer research uk says 2.1million patients are awaiting crucial screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer.  another 290,000 have missed out on urgent referrals to confirm or rule out tumours.  and at least 21,600 patients have had surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy postponed in the past nine weeks.  some of these procedures would have saved lives or extended them, granting precious extra time with loved ones.  it is also thought patients with warning signs of cancer have avoided seeking help because they are worried about contracting coronavirus in a surgery or hospital.  with the lockdown being eased today to allow friends and family to meet up, for some shops to reopen and pupils to return to school:  ministers stressed primaries are safe amid fears some pupils will be kept away;  britons were urged to remain sensible and not overdo interactions with others;  police were forced to issue dispersal orders to crowds on beaches in bude, north cornwall, after social-distancing rules were flouted;  up to two million vulnerable patients who have been shielding will be allowed outside for the first time in two months;  a further 113 virus deaths were reported yesterday, the lowest figure during lockdown;  some scientists warned restrictions were being eased too early with infections and deaths still high;  a poll suggested the conservative lead over labour had crashed by eight points following the dominic cummings saga.  the numbers awaiting cancer treatment are extremely worrying, according to sarah woolnough, policy chief at cancer research uk.  she added: ‘we’re going to have this huge backlog to clear. it’s a massive backlog of services and treatment to deliver. it’s absolutely huge, it’s thousands and thousands and thousands.’  i’m at risk after crucial drugs had to be stopped for three years joanna addis has received cutting-edge drugs to keep her breast cancer from growing. but in april the 54-year-old was told her treatment was to be paused for three months. her treatment – a combination of the drugs palbociclib and letrozole – was thought to be too dangerous to take during the pandemic because it depresses the immune system. fears: joanna addis lives with her husband volky in stockport mrs addis, who lives in stockport with husband volky, had been taking the treatment since 2017 after surgery failed to control her cancer. ‘i try not to think about what will happen over the next two months, but i do worry about what my scan in june will show,’ she said. ‘if my disease was to progress, i’d feel like i had wasted a treatment option and the time it could have given me. ‘striking off such a valuable treatment not because of my cancer becoming unresponsive, but because of the risk of the virus, doesn’t seem fair. i ended up in hospital soon after i came off palbociclib as pain in my right hip became so severe that i couldn’t walk, which felt like too much of a coincidence at the time. ‘thankfully, no cancer progression was found, but i do really worry what may happen if i need to stay off the treatment for even longer. ‘everything just feels so out of my control at the moment, which is really difficult.’ advertisement  professor charles swanton, the charity’s chief clinician, said: ‘my colleagues and i have seen the devastating impact of this pandemic on both patients and nhs staff. delays to diagnosis and treatment could mean that some cancers will become inoperable.’  the longer a patient waits to be diagnosed and treated for cancer, the greater the likelihood their tumours will spread to other tissues and organs to the extent they become inoperable.  cancer research’s data shows that across the uk, 12,800 patients have missed out on surgery, 6,000 on chemotherapy and another 2,800 on radiotherapy.  the figures for surgery are particularly worrying because these procedures would otherwise remove tumours that may now have grown or spread.  almost 2.5million patients have missed out on vital cancer tests and treatment because of the pandemic [file photo]  many hospitals have delayed chemotherapy, radiotherapy or operations to remove tumours to enable them to cope with a surge in virus cases, as well as to cut cancer patients’ risk of becoming infected when they come in.  at the same time, patients with worrying symptoms, including lumps on their breasts or frequent urination, which could be a sign of prostate cancer, have been reluctant to make appointments with gps.  some family doctors have not been sending patients to hospital for certain diagnostic tests as they have also been halted, particularly procedures to detect bowel cancer.  routine screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer has been suspended in most areas over the past two months despite being crucial for detecting early stage tumours.  lynda thomas of macmillan cancer support said: ‘long before the pandemic hit, cancer waiting times were at their worst. since the coronavirus outbreak, it is has become even harder for people with cancer to get the care and support they need and their anxieties have multiplied.’  two months on, and still waiting for vital surgery a father with terminal cancer is still waiting for surgery two months after it was cancelled the day before it was due to take place. glynne pugh, 68, has bowel cancer and was given 12 months to live last november. he was due to have an operation at st james’s university hospital in leeds on march 23. his family were told the postponement was due to the closure of the operating theatre for coronavirus training. mr pugh’s son bradley, 32, said at the time: ‘it was just devastating – mum and dad were completely in shock and obviously tearful. as a family we understand how much pressure the nhs is under, but we feel that, as dad’s operation is life or death, the cancer might spread. there is only about six months left, that’s the problem.’ glynne pugh, 68, pictured above with his son brad, has bowel cancer and was given 12 months to live last november. he was due to have an operation at st james’s university hospital in leeds on march 23 his father has survived cancer twice before and his family insist he is strong enough to endure treatment again, but the operation remains vital. ‘there was hope there for the whole family, which was everyone was holding out for,’ said bradley, of stroud, gloucestershire. ‘what the nhs must be going through is absolutely terrible. they are all doing a fantastic job, but we still feel dad deserves the operation because he is our hero. this is a man who has worked extremely hard all his life.’ mr pugh worked as an engineer from the age of 18.  baroness delyth morgan of the charity breast cancer now said: ‘it’s extremely concerning to hear of the major impacts the pandemic continues to have on thousands of people affected by cancer. the outbreak has led to many people’s cancer treatment being paused or delayed, an extremely worrying drop in the number of people being referred to see a cancer specialist, thousands of screening appointments being cancelled and some clinical trials being paused.’  figures from cancer research uk in april showed 2,700 cases were being missed a week, partly because patients were shunning their gps and missing out on screening.  the charity says that – thanks in part to a daily mail front page on april 22 – the numbers contacting family doctors with warning signs has begun to increase, although many are still staying at home.  a more recent estimate of missed cases from macmillan put the number at 2,000 a week. but officials are now anxious that the nhs will be unable to cope with the huge surge in patients who will start coming through the system for diagnosis or treatment once the pandemic abates.  even before the virus took off in the uk in march, cancer waiting times were at their worst since records began in 2010 with understaffed hospitals struggling to cope.  this means that patients who have already waited months for a cancer diagnosis or treatment will face a ‘bottleneck’ in accessing care.  hospitals will be further constrained by strict infection control measures that mean only limited numbers can have ct or mri scans each day as machines will have to be thoroughly cleaned. chemotherapy will also be restricted to a few patients at a time due to social-distancing rules.  cancer research uk is also calling on the government and the nhs to dramatically increase testing for staff and patients within specialist treatment centres to ensure they are covid-free.  the nhs launched these centres last month in private hospitals and nhs hospitals as a means of providing safe areas for cancer patients to undergo diagnosis and treatment far away from virus wards.  but the charity says that unless patients are tested every time they come for treatment, with staff also being tested very frequently, they cannot be reassured that these centres are clear of coronavirus.  an nhs spokesman said: ‘even though more people than ever started nhs cancer treatment in march, coronavirus has turned millions of lives upside down. cancer services are largely now open, ready and able to receive all patients who need care, so the critical point is that anyone who is concerned about a possible cancer symptom should contact their gp practice and come forward for a check-up.’  plight of mother in limbo after clinical trials paused karen hilton was due to marry alistair, her partner of ten years, in april but the lockdown scuppered their plans karen hilton was due to marry alistair, her partner of ten years, in april but the lockdown scuppered their plans. the decision to cancel the event was all the more galling as the 48-year-old fears she may be running out of time to treat her breast cancer. after first being diagnosed in may 2016 and then again in 2017, miss hilton, from dalkeith in scotland, was found to be suffering from secondary cancer in september 2018 after noticing lumps on her collarbone. miss hilton, a former senior consultant for hsbc, is having chemotherapy but fears she may have to stop if it compromises her health. she said: ‘i’ve been on my current treatment for a few weeks now, but it could compromise my blood count and if it drops too low, i may have to stop.’ she had hoped to take part in clinical trials for new drugs, but many of these are on hold due to the outbreak. miss hilton, who has a 13-year-old son, said: ‘i want to see my son grow up and it’s heartbreaking to think that might not happen. unfortunately, i only have so many options left, and those options include trials for new treatments.’ she added: ‘they could be the thing that keep me alive but at the moment due to covid-19 i’m not getting access and i don’t know how long it’s going to take for clinical trials to come back. ‘while it’s a frightening situation, i’m also living with hope that i will get the treatment i need.’  a truly terrible toll for those left to suffer in silence at home  analysis by sue reid for the daily mail  patients with cancer, heart problems and other life-threatening ailments are feared to have died at home as the nhs turned its focus to the pandemic.  alarmingly, delays in cancer surgery alone will cost more lives than the number of virus patients saved in hospitals, predicts britain’s institute of cancer research, one of the world’s most-respected health bodies.  the wake-up call, in an institute report, warns a three-month delay in operations on the most common adult cancers risks 5,000 extra deaths. a six-month delay would push those excess fatalities up to 11,000.  the nhs waiting list already stretches to many millions and now faces one of the steepest backlog of cases in its history. the british medical association says that for doctors and all healthcare workers, this is a daunting prospect [file photo]  the disturbing report follows shocking new figures released by cancer research uk that more than two million patients have missed out on vital cancer tests and treatment during the pandemic. last week, macmillan cancer support warned that nearly 2,000 cases of cancer are going undiagnosed every week due to the crisis.  the mail revealed the unfolding tragedy of untreated patients last month. by the end of april, just a few weeks after the nhs switched its attention to covid-19 sufferers, hospital referrals for cancer treatment in england had dropped by nearly 70 per cent.  under 100 organ transplants were carried out in april, the lowest for 36 years, according to nhs figures. on a day in april, only six of its 24 liver transplant centres were open.  professor peter friend, director of the oxford transplant centre, says that liver, kidney, and heart patients were already dying on lengthy waiting lists before the pandemic. ‘the effect of doing fewer transplants means that this mortality rate must increase,’ he has warned.  the ordinary public seems to think that hospitals are dangerous places to be right now. one allergy specialist told the mail that in his north of england clinic, only the most seriously ill risk being infected by the virus [file photo]  cardiac specialists have reported a 60 per cent decline in hospital admissions for heart attacks, a condition which the nhs says requires ‘immediate’ treatment in casualty.  meanwhile, a death certificate count by the office for national statistics shows almost 13,000 more people than expected have died in england and wales since mid-march from causes other than coronavirus.  statisticians at oxford and cambridge are now calling for a national inquiry into the extra deaths amid fears that a lack of medical care is responsible.  professor sir david spiegelhalter, chairman of the winton centre for risk and evidence communication at the university of cambridge, explained: ‘there’s a huge spike in non-covid deaths at home very quickly into the epidemic.  ‘it’s important to know how many might have been at least delayed if the normal (nhs) healthcare system had existed.’ visits to england’s accident and emergency departments have halved since the outbreak, tumbling to the lowest since records began.  it means people displaying the early signs of serious diseases have stayed away in their thousands. a nurse and mail reader has sent us reports with photos showing how many people were at four main casualty departments on a recent monday afternoon.  the waiting rooms at the finest flagship hospitals in london – chelsea and westminster, st thomas’ in westminster, st mary’s paddington and the royal london in the east end – had just a handful of patients.  the wake-up call, in an institute report, warns a three-month delay in operations on the most common adult cancers risks 5,000 extra deaths. a six-month delay would push those excess fatalities up to 11,000 [file photo]  it suggests people are afraid of going to casualty in case they break lockdown rules or catch the virus while there. the ordinary public seems to think that hospitals are dangerous places to be right now.  one allergy specialist told the mail that in his north of england clinic, only the most seriously ill risk being infected by the virus.  ‘these are people who are desperate for help. they will take a risk. others are afraid of coming to my clinic and could lose their lives because of that.’  nhs england has produced a complex ‘road map’ for opening up hospitals to all patients. those accepted for treatment or operations will have to isolate for 14 days and be clear of any symptoms before admission. inevitably it will mean more delays.  significantly, there will be tests on patients before they arrive to make sure they are covid-19 free to ‘protect’ others working and being cared for in the hospitals.  but when the virus is defeated, children are back to school, shops reopened, and cities no longer in lockdown, what will happen to the countless numbers who are seriously ill and whose treatment has been delayed?  the nhs waiting list already stretches to many millions and now faces one of the steepest backlog of cases in its history.  the british medical association says that for doctors and all healthcare workers, this is a daunting prospect.  a spokesman said: ‘they want nothing more than to provide the best care for their patients and avoid delays in essential treatment for diseases.’  one has to wonder whether the doctors’ goodwill will really be enough."
health,"families were given advice on how to pronounce a death themselves if medics were not available during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, outraging coroners.  the government says a relative could 'verify' the death of a loved one in their own home with the help of a gp on the phone.  it links to emergency guidance drawn up by the british medical association (bma) and royal college of general practitioners for anyone without medical training to refer to.  a checklist asks if the body is stiff and if light has gone from the eyes using a mobile phone torch. if the person is classified as dead, the undertakers can be contacted.  the guidance, which will remain in place until a review at the end of the pandemic, has been put in place to 'speed up' the process of verifying deaths.  services have been overwhelmed, particularly during the height of the crisis in april. and the bma urged against calling doctors from the frontline.  but coroners blasted the advice and said it was 'inappropriate for a person who is not suitably trained to recognise death'.  they warned it could lead to families reporting that patients were dead when they were still alive because their breathing was very shallow.  health chiefs have said family members can pronounce a death during the coronavirus pandemic using controversial guidelines (stock)  a checklist, drawn up by the british medical association (bma) and royal college of general practitioners, asks if the body is stiff and if light has gone from the eyes using a mobile phone torch. if the person is classified as dead, the undertakers can be contacted  there are four processes to go through when someone dies, the first of which is 'verification of death'.  there is no law which says only a doctor or trained professional, such as a paramedic must verify the death of someone.  anyone who is 'competent' is allowed, but there has been debate over what this means, especially during the pandemic.  since the coronavirus act 2020 was passed, emergency legislation means anyone can pronounce a death if they feel comfortable to.  government guidance, published publicly on may 5, 'provides a framework for safe verification of death in this coronavirus (covid-19) emergency period' for anyone without medical training.  the relaxation of rules - which has been faced with criticism - means care workers and family members can verify a death outside of hospital without a doctor present.  'this helps avoid long delays in waiting for verification before the deceased person can be moved when medical practitioners are unavailable, which can be distressing for their families and those close to them,' the guidance says.  the department of health and social care endorse a set of steps drawn up by the bma and rcogps, which say there is no need for a gp to be present for the verification of a death.  it says anyone who is present at an 'expected death' can take it upon themselves to check the deceased while on the phone to a gp if they are comfortable with it.  the document, designed mostly to support care workers, asks: 'is rigor mortis present (is the body stiff)?' - if yes, the person notes down the time.  if no, the person has to carry out three more checks. they are told: 'check pupils are dilated and do not respond to light in both eyes from mobile phone torch.  'check no chest wall movements for three minutes by observing the chest (exposing the chest may be necessary).  'locate site of cartoid pulse (using video advice from guiding clinician if required) and check that pulse is absent for at least one minute.  'absent heartbeat using a stethoscope may provide further confirmation.'  the process must be repeated after ten minutes to confirm a death before funeral directors are contacted.  the department of health and social care endorse a set of guidelines drawn up by the bma and rcogps. it says non-medical professionals - which includes family members - can verify a death if they feel comfortable to while on the phone to a gp  the document said: 'during the covid-19 pandemic the processes in relation to death registration have been changing to... minimise delays and distress for families and to protect public health.  vulnerable people can leave lockdown families across england will finally be able to see their elderly relatives again tomorrow, as millions of vulnerable people ‘shielding’ are allowed to spend time outdoors. as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, 2.2 million vulnerable people will be able to go outside with members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. those who live alone will be able to meet outside with one other person from another household, in a move that will bring joy to thousands. some groups of people are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness with coronavirus and had been asked to strictly follow shielding measures. according to nhs inform, this 'extremely clinically vulnerable' group includes people who have specific cancers, are organ transplant recipients, are on immunosuppressant drugs, or have severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe copd. boris johnson last night hailed the ‘resilience’ of those who have been shielding since march, with many having no face-to-face contact since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. the prime minister said: ‘i want to thank everyone who has followed the shielding guidance – it is because of your patience and sacrifice that thousands of lives have been saved. i do not underestimate just how difficult it has been for you, staying at home for the last ten weeks, and i want to pay tribute to your resilience.' the announcement came alongside a relaxing of rules to allow groups of up to six people from different households to exercise together from tomorrow. but four members of the government’s scientific advisory group on emergencies (sage) have criticised the moves, saying they are coming too soon and risk worsening the pandemic. advertisement  'this guidance is designed to provide remote support by people (such as care workers) who have not had training in verifying death so that the verification process can be completed by a clinician safely and speedily.  'if relatives/friends of the deceased wish to support the process before the undertaker arrives, care needs to be taken to ensure this is appropriate and conducted sensitively – no person should be asked to do anything they are uncomfortable with.'  but the guidelines, also endorsed by the care quality commission, were slammed by eight london coroners as inappropriate.  in a letter to the bma dated april 14, they said: 'we do not consider that it is an acceptable position for untrained funeral directors or family members to verify life extinct.  'diagnosis of death is a clinical one undertaken by a competent adult with the appropriate skills and training.  'it is, in our view, inappropriate for a person who is not suitably trained to recognise death.'  the coroners warned a person who does not have medical training may wrongly announce a death when someone is actually still alive.  they even claimed that it could lead to families reporting that patients were dead when they were still alive.  they wrote: 'there are some clinical conditions whereby patients are deeply unconscious, with very shallow irregular respirations.  'the checks set out in the guidance may fail to correctly diagnose these patients.'  the coroners also disagree with separate protocols drawn up by lmcs (local medical services). guidance to gps in london reportedly say: 'anyone can verify death. absolutely anyone. there is no need for any special training despite what some may say.'  dr bharat pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at exeter university, said the guidance is devoid of any emotion.  he told the sun: '[it] does sound very distressing. the language used is stark and clinical and devoid of emotion, maybe it should be communicated in a softer, gentler way.'  a district nurse added: 'families are already grief-stricken and now in some cases they are being asked to verify the death because some doctors don't want to come out (to the home) as they are worried about coronavirus.  'imagine being asked to make these checks. it doesn't bear thinking about.'  dr rosie benneyworth, of the cqc, admitted the process can be 'emotionally testing' for someone who has not done it before.  but the bma responded to the london coroners and said their stance was 'disappointing in the extreme' and in opposition to other coroners.  it could indirectly cause excess deaths because doctors would be unnecessarily pulled away from the coronavirus frontline.  if community services fail, the letter said, 'hospitals will be flooded and quickly overwhelmed', which will 'result in excess deaths'.  'our workforce is severely limited, hence the need for government to bring back into harness thousands of retired doctors.'  dr mark sanford-wood, deputy chair of gpc england at the bma, said today: 'covid-19 has created huge challenges to the health service around the manner in which we care for the deceased and their families, which is why the bma felt it necessary to form guidance about how best to ensure safe and accurate death verification during this difficult time.  'english law allows that any competent adult may verify that someone has passed away. some organisations have interpreted this in different ways leading to some uncertainty about the correct approach to take in these circumstances.  'this has led to doctors being asked to attend these cases in person, creating unnecessary risk for their other patients, those who were caring for the deceased, and themselves.  'to address this, the bma and the rcgp have developed a protocol for providing help and guidance to a competent adult – not necessarily a family member, but a community health worker - via video link.  'the timely and efficient verification of death is always an emotionally difficult time, but important in the current crisis, and we would hope that all will play their part, where they are able and content to do so, in assisting in this.  'we have worked with nhse and cqc during the development of these guidelines and they are endorsed across the system. we are also pleased that many coroners are now supportive of this approach.  'these are truly unprecedented times, and we understand the significant distress this subject matter can bring to the loved ones of someone taken during this horrific pandemic. our guidance is therefore, based on the principle that all participants in the system must be conscious of this and conduct themselves in a manner that does not add to the already immense emotional suffering of families.'"
health,"advertisement  the first five months of sage meeting notes have revealed how scientists and health officials initially wrote-off coronavirus as another swine flu before realising their error and desperately trying to catch up.  the minutes, which cover 34 meetings held by the country's top scientists and used in the government's daily response to covid, were published for the first time on friday.  the scientific advisory group for emergencies is split between independent experts and government officials, and meeting notes reveal that members had to contend with incorrect assessments in the early days of the crisis.  they also detail how the group's changing focus on the need for testing and surveillance of the virus as more and more information emerged from wuhan, in china.  the documents also reveal members beliefs that the coronavirus pandemic could have no more of an impact on the world than the 2009 swine flu pandemic.  evidence gathering and analysis, during these early staged, appeared to have been prioritised over taking immediate action.  the world health organisation's health emergencies programme director dr mike ryan told the daily telegraph: 'if you need to be right before you move, you will never win.'  but the documents do show that sage caught-up quickly and changed tack when the committee believed evidence required a new course of action.  minutes show how sage was able to quickly publicise and make the case for lockdown on march 23.  january 22: nine days before first uk case, committee says people arriving from wuhan should not be isolated  sage met for the first time in january as a 'precautionary' measure, 22 days after the virus was reported in china and nine days before the first case is identified in the uk.  the committee noted testing capacity in wuhan has already been 'overwhelmed' and says there is evidence of person-to-person transmission.  in a relaxed tone it also talked about the then lack of evidence on whether individuals are infectious before showing symptoms and what the viral incubation period is.  drawing on knowledge from sars epidemic, they say individuals arriving in the uk from wuhan 'are no longer at risk if they show no symptoms for 14 days' but says port of entry screening is 'not advised'.  closing in a calm fashion, they said: 'the uk currently has good centralised diagnostic capacity for wn-cov - and is days away from a specific test, which is scale-able across the uk in weeks.'  on january 31, 83 uk citizens were repatriated on a flight out of wuhan, which had been arrange by the uk government.  the evacuees were immediately sent to arrowe park hospital in the wirral, where they underwent a 14-day quarantine.  january 22: the first sage meeting focusing on the virus, which then appeared to have been cornered in china, ended with a positive and upbeat tone  on january 31, 83 uk citizens were repatriated on a flight out of wuhan. the evacuees were immediately sent to arrowe park hospital in the wirral, where they underwent a 14-day quarantine  a health worker wearing protective gear pictured in wuhan, the original epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak  february: restrictions on transport will buy, at most, 15 days before an epidemic hits - but the nhs needs a month to prepare  three days after the first case is identified on british soil, sage starts warning of a fast approaching epidemic.  it predicts the number of cases are doubling every four to five days, while the number of cases in china could be as high as 300,000.  turning to transport restrictions, however, they said that even reducing the number of imported infections by 90 per cent would only buy an estimated 15 days.  'only a month of additional preparation time for the nhs would be meaningful,' they said. 'to prevent imported infections along these lines would require draconian and coordinated measures, because direct flights from china are not the only route for infected individuals to enter the uk.'  january 28: sage's early understanding of the virus based on data coming out of china is listed above  february 3: sage warns restrictions can only buy up to 15 days - falling short of the month the nhs will need to prepare  as britain dithered china got to work building hospitals from scratch. pictured is a hospital for around 2,000 medical workers to treat patients in leishanshan or thunder god hospital, which occupies 14 acres and has 1,600 beds  sage found that restrictions on transport will buy, at most, 15 days before an epidemic hits. pictured are staff in hazmat suits boarding a flight at heathrow on february 14, amid fears a malaysian family on board had coronavirus  by february 13, the first 83 patients ate arrowe park hospital were able to leave, matt raw, 38, held his fist in the air and shouted 'we're free,' as he emerged from quarantine  it warns that travel restrictions at this point, even targeting only wuhan, would have a limited impact as the virus could also arrive from other countries.  the committee meets nine times during this month.  on february 11 they said the government should keep working using 'influenza pandemic assumptions', saying an epidemic could peak around two to three months from then.  'it is expected that all parts of the uk would be impacted at about the same time,' they said, 'with only small delays between regions'.  'when there is sustained transmission in the uk, contact tracing will no longer be useful,' they said.  more brits were arriving on government-chartered flights and being sent to arrowe park  by february 13, the first 83 patients to arrive were able to leave, matt raw, 38, held his fist in the air and shouted 'we're free,' as he emerged from quarantine.  february 11: sage shifts away from sars and suggests that the government should work on the assumption coronavirus is going to behave like an influenza pandemic  february 25: lockdown is mentioned for the first time  sage suddenly switches its tone on february 25 to warn that interventions should seek to 'contain, delay and reduce the peak' of coronavirus 'in that order'.  'sage discussed a paper modelling four non-pharmaceutical interventions: university and school closures, home isolation, household quarantine and social distancing, with use of interventions in combination,' they said.  'all measures require implementation for a significant duration in order to be effective.'  despite the mention it was still almost a month before the uk introduced a lockdown as ministers considered alternative outcomes.  february 25: sage switches its tone to lockdown for the first time, reflecting growing concern  lockdown was mentioned for the first time in february, though it wouldn't be imposed for another month. pictured is county oak medical centre in brighton which was shut down, sealed off and cleaned by a team in hazmat suits in february  march: uk has 10,000 cases at least and is four to five weeks behind italy, meaning testing is 'now a priority'  as early as march 3 sage began to warn that an agreement on 'optimal timing' for behavioural and social interventions will be needed.  the committee also starts to discuss social distancing for the over 65s which it says will 'have a significant effect on overall deaths and peak demand fro critical care beds, but will not significantly reduce overall transmission'.  proposing a timeline on march 5, they suggest symptomatic individuals should start isolating with their families to delay the virus' spread, with isolation for the over 65s to be implemented two weeks later.  on the same day, a woman in her 70s from reading was the first covid-19 death to be reported, two days later a man in his 80s from milton keynes died.  sage warned that the uk was tracking italy's trajectory as early as march in bergamo, italy  march 5: sage warns that there are no scientific grounds to move away from a containment focus in the uk  march 10: uk is predicted to have thousands of cases. at the time only 373 had been identified  march 10: phe is asked to work out how it will get more tests, seen to be a key measure  march 13: sage warns that the virus may be moving across the uk faster than expected  thousands of people attended cheltenham festival in gloucestershire, pictured above on march 13, despite concerns that the uk had around 10,000 coronavirus cases at the time and calls for social distancing to be implemented  on march 10 they suggest the uk has around 10,000 cases with 'transmission underway'. at this time the country had only identified 373 cases officially.  there is also a sense of growing fury with phe, as it's recommended more tests are 'now the priority'.  'a test for frontline diagnostics may come from the private sector,' they said, and recommended phe should immediately assess how it could scale up testing from 1,00 to 10,000 a week.  adding to mounting concern, they said: 'the uk is considered to be four to five weeks behind italy but on a similar curve (six to eight weeks behind if interventions are applied)'.  on the same day the cheltenham festival goes ahead as planned, with thousands of people in attendance.  around 150,000 people attended the four-day event.  on march 13 they warn the uk has 'more cases... than sage previously expected at this point, and we may therefore be further ahead on the epidemic curve'.  they call for social distancing measures to be implemented 'soon', and say they are keen to make their modelling available 'to the public and fellow scientists'.  march 16: calls for social distancing 'as soon as possible'  the sage committee, already stating the virus is accelerating faster than previously thought, calls for social distancing measures to be implemented 'as soon as possible'.  'these additional measures will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in testing and the availability of near real-time data flows to understand their impacts,' they said.  the number of cases has also been ramped up to an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 new infections a day, with the total number doubling every five to six days.  by march 16 the uk had identified 1,543 cases and recorded 40 deaths due to coronavirus  march 16: sage advises that social distancing measures are introduced 'as soon as possible'  march 16: they also forecast there are up to 10,000 new cases a day in the country, with the total number doubling every five to six days  march 16: the committee also piled pressure on to phe to find a way to ramp up testing  two days later the committee recommends schools should be closed 'as soon as practicable' to prevent nhs intensive care capacity being exceeded.  discussing the closure of restaurants, bars, cafes and offices, they said: 'if interventions are required, it would be better to act early'.  despite the warning the government did not ask bars, restaurants, cafes and gyms to close until march 20, and did not begin a lockdown until march 23.  the lockdown came a day after mother's day, when parks and beaches were filled with families before the country was plunged into an unprecedented clampdown on socialising.  march 23: uk announces nationwide lockdown  sage also held a meeting on this day where it warned there is a 'higher reproduction number' of coronavirus in the country than previously anticipated.  some measures had already been brought in and while they indicated 'significant changes', they said there is still 'room for improvement in compliance rates'.  noting changes in london, the then epicentre, they said footfall in the capital's transport hubs had dropped by 90 per cent but had not decreased as much at retail and food outlets.  the number of people in parks had also trebled, they said.  boris johnson told the uk to lockdown on march 23 (pictured). he was admitted to hospital with the virus on april 5  march 23: the day the lockdown is announced sage urges more action on testing, and says they aim to get tests to 110,000 by mid-april, 15 days before matt hancocks lower target of 100,000 tests  they also began targeting 110,000 coronavirus tests a day by mid-april, more than 15 days ahead of matt hanock's may 1 target.  'nhs testing capacity in the uk is currently at around 5,000 a day, to be increased to 15,000 a day by mid-april,' they said.  'a platform in partnership with the private sector has been established to aim to increase capacity to 110,000 a day by mid-april.  two days before lockdown was announced, military planners and nhs bosses met at the excel london.  the exhibition centre was being considered as britain's first nightingale hospital - a temporary treatment centre for covid-19 cases. it would open within weeks of the visit.  april: preventing a second wave with vaccines and social distancing  with lockdown in place, sage turned its attention to working to avoid a second wave so that the damaging measures do not need to be re-imposed.  they noted that therapeutics and a vaccine would both play a 'critical role' in the permanent lifting of restrictions.  the committee also began to discuss whether face masks could work - first saying that despite 'weak evidence' the virus may be able to survive on them for up to seven days.  on april 3 nhs nightingale hospital london opens with 500 beds at the excel centre in east london.  it opens with potential for 4,000 patients should london's hospitals be overwhelmed with covid-19 patients - the first patients arrive on april 5.  on april 30 they also advised for 'comprehensive availability and deployment' of the seasonal flu vaccine this winter.  april 7: as lockdown takes effect sage reports that covid-19s spread appears to be slowing  april 7: they also begin to consider a possible exit strategy which will not cause a second wave  they also continued to advise ministers on the lockdown, continuously noting that case numbers had first been arrested before beginning to fall.  'relatively small changes to social distancing measures could push r back above one in the community,' they said in early april, 'it is therefore too early to recommend releasing any measures'.  by april 7 they had already noted transmission 'may be slowing' and, two days later that the virus could have 'reached its peak' with hospital admissions 'stabilising' and the number of people in icu 'flattening'.  by april 30 they said: 'hospital admissions are declining consistently across the country'.  sage also noted that it welcomed the government's decision to release the names of the committee.  prime minister boris johnson was admitted to hospital was the virus on april 5.  at this point sage continued to say that cases were stabalising. pictured is the excel centre in london, which was transformed into an nhs nightingale hospital  april 30: vaccines are considered crucial to finding a way out of the pandemic. sage also advised that stocks of seasonal flu vaccine should be prepared  april 23: warning about care homes  sage notes for the first time a 'small but significant' portion of deaths are related to care homes, rather than hospitals.  on april 30 they added, 'understanding the causes of transmission in care homes is more challenging' before listing limiting factors.  the advisory board's comments came on the same day boris johnson said britain was 'past the peak' of the covid-19 outbreak.  at the time, britain's death toll stood at 26,771.  april 23: sage warns that there is a growing number of deaths in the uk's care homes  nine people - including a nurse - died in 10 days at a dundee care home as sage scientists realised the horrific scale of the virus spread in care homes for the first time  may: schools should only re-open if 'effective measures are in place to monitor the effects and to respond to cases'  minutes published by the government revealed that sage continued to discuss how to ease lockdown restrictions without causing a second wave in early may.  a large portion of this focused on schools, and whether or not they should be asked to unbolt their gates to pupils again.  sage advised that, for this to happen, 'effective measures should be in place to monitor the effects of any change in schools, and to respond to cases within schools.'  schools are set to return on monday with social distancing measures in place. pictured is grove road primary school in tring, hertfordshire  may 11: sage releases its advice on bringing back schools to the government, saying effective monitoring measures will be needed. pupils are set to return on june 1 despite ongoing alleged problems with the track and trace system  'indirect effects of re-opening schools (regardless of which option is taken) are likely to have a greater impact on transmission than schools themselves (e.g. work-related reopening, behaviour changes),' they said.  'for a variety of reasons re-opening options relating to younger children are lower risk than those related to older children'.  they also note previous work which showed young children may be less susceptible to infection, up to the age of 13, although it is not clear whether transmissibility by children is lower in adults.  the government has asked pupils in reception, four and five years old, year one, five and six years old, and year six, aged nine to ten years old, to go back to school on monday.  as schools prepare to return to work thousands flock to the coast. pictured: visitors and sunbathers flock to durdle door at lulworth in dorset on a scorching hot sunny day  however, this is being done against a backdrop of issues getting the contact-tracing system up and running, which appears to be against sage guidance.  sage has said that for this system to be effective it must catch at least 80 per cent of contacts and isolate those with covid-19 within 48 hours, meaning a rapid test turnaround is needed.  in a meeting on may 7 they also criticised the government's idea of 'bubbles', stating they pose 'potential unforseen risks' and could lead to the establishment of transmission networks.  'as steps are taken to ease the lockdown,' they said, 'each needs to be accompanied by very clear communication of the continued public health justification for remaining restrictions.'  on may 5 britain reached the grim milestone of the highest death toll in europe, when the number of brits to die from covid-19 reached 29,427, passing italy.  foreign secretary dominic raab said the figure was ""a massive tragedy"".  may 11: boris johnson announces the first easing of lockdown restrictions  the prime minister announced the first moves to ease lockdown.  he said anyone who can't work from home is encouraged to go back to work, allowed the public unlimited outdoor exercise and gave permission to drive to other destinations.  however, as minutes have only been published up to may 7, we cannot see what scientific advice was followed.  mr johnson's announcement was met with confusion however, after england's stay at home message changed to stay alert. scotland and wales however extended their own lockdowns.  the announcement caused traffic to return to london's roads in particular, with tube passengers also on the rise.  the sudden spike in commuters led to calls for public transport services to be run at pre-lockdown levels so passengers could follow social distancing rules properly."
health,"starting today — and continuing all this week — dr michael mosley unveils his health revolution to help you stay one step ahead of coronavirus as the lockdown eases. in exclusive extracts from his new book covid-19, he will help you get in the best shape to fight the virus and unveil a blueprint to bolster your immune system as well as measures to keep you and your family safe.  as many of us venture out into the world once more after so many weeks of lockdown, it can be tough to balance that heady mix of excitement to get back to some kind of normal, with an undercurrent of fear that the covid-19 virus is still out there.  once we start working and socialising, even tentatively, we inevitably put ourselves at some risk.  social distancing and diligent handwashing will help, but if you want to increase the chances of being one of the lucky few who experience mild symptoms — or even no symptoms at all — you're going to have to ensure your immune system is working at its absolute optimum.  if you do come into contact with the virus, a well-functioning immune system could be enough to stop its progression into your lungs, and dramatically reduce your chance of complications.  your immune system faces a tricky balancing act. it has to respond to threats, but not go too far  the worst covid complications — the ones that send people to intensive care — are often caused by an immune system which initially responds ineffectively, then completely overcompensates in its attempts to control the viral invader.  your immune system faces a tricky balancing act. it has to respond to threats, but not go too far.  one of the reasons older people are dying in such large numbers is because the immune system tends to become less efficient as we age.  it fails to react when it should, then overreacts and causes extensive collateral damage.  but the good news is there are simple lifestyle changes you can make that can not only keep your immune system in good shape, but may even turn back the clock so that it operates like the immune system of someone quite a bit younger!  today and all this week, in extracts from my new book covid-19, i'll be sharing my blueprint for shoring up your defences so you are in the best shape to fight this virus.  your immune system is a complex army of cells that works hard on your behalf to identify and destroy any potentially dangerous invaders such as bacteria and viruses.  a typical covid-19 infection begins when you inhale viral particles from someone who is infected, or you pick up some particles on your fingers by touching a surface where droplets have fallen.  if you don't wash your hands, then the next time you touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus gets in.  these viral particles will, most likely, start by infecting your upper throat.  that is why one of the early signs is often a dry, persistent covid cough.  in 'covid-19, what you need to know about the coronavirus and the race for the vaccine' by dr michael mosley, he tells you how to defend yourself  what makes viruses like this so dangerous is that once they get into the cells that line your throat, they hijack the mechanism of those cells to make lots more copies of themselves.  it is like a rogue robot taking over a factory and using it to produce endless versions of itself before going off to another factory to do the same.  once the virus is in, the race is on between the virus, which will try to replicate as fast as possible, and your immune system, which will try to destroy it, before it can really take hold.  the trouble is, since your body has never seen this sort of virus before, it will take time to mount an adequate immune response.  and in some people the response will come too weakly and too late.  people like me, who are over 60, tend to have weaker, less efficient immune systems and, initially, may be slower to mount an adequate response.  it is shocking to see how badly an attack of covid-19 can impact people who are obese  then, when it comes, the response is too strong and uncoordinated, leading to extensive damage as your immune system attacks healthy cells, as well as those infected by the virus.  other people who are at risk are those who are significantly overweight (like boris johnson was) or who have pre-existing conditions such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes.  that's partly because covid-19 can make your blood clot, and if your blood vessels are already damaged through long-term raised blood sugar levels or too much fat in the blood, then this can put you at risk of heart attack or stroke.  it is shocking to see how badly an attack of covid-19 can impact people who are obese.  one reason is the more overweight you are, the lower your lung capacity.  so if covid-19 attacks your lungs, then you are more likely to end up in intensive care.  being fit and active will promote good blood circulation and help your immune system to do its job properly  people with excess fat also tend to have a less efficient immune response, which is why adopting a healthy diet and slimming down is a key step in the right direction.  good sleep is important, too. it's essential for the production and release of key components of your immune system and there is strong evidence that getting a good night's rest is a great way to keep infections at bay.  we all know that regular physical activity is good for your heart, your bones and your muscles.  it can also improve your mood. but what i find particularly encouraging right now is evidence that just 20 minutes a day is enough to give your immune system a good workout as well.  being fit and active will promote good blood circulation and help your immune system to do its job properly.  good sleep is important, too. it's essential for the production and release of key components of your immune system  being confined to your home should certainly not be an excuse for not exercising, and in friday's unmissable pullout i will share with you exercise routines you can do at home.  there's no doubt that these are horribly stressful times and we know that chronic stress has a direct and damaging effect on your immune function.  any increase in the stress hormone, cortisol, decreases the ability of our immune system to respond effectively to infections.  while it's hard to avoid everyday stress altogether, all the lifestyle tips i've just described, from losing weight to becoming more active and eating a ­mediterranean-style diet, are great ways to reduce stress.  i'll show you how to try to strike a balance.  knowing the danger zones when you are outside of your house, you are most likely to pick up the virus in a confined space, such as in a lift, or on public transport. you catch it from droplets, which come out in a fine spray when someone with the virus coughs, sings or shouts. you can also inhale viral particles when someone talks, particularly if you are up close and personal. you are much less likely to get the virus from someone you walk past on the street because your risk of infection depends on how close you are to an infected person when they cough or sneeze, and also how long you spend in their company. outdoor encounters with strangers are usually brief and any virus particles will be easily damaged by exposure to ultraviolet light even on an overcast day. now that we are allowed to socialise again in small groups, it's safest to do so outside because any airborne virus particles will be carried off by the breeze. but remain meticulous with your hand-washing all the same. advertisement  one of the clear differences between countries that controlled the initial spread of the virus, such as china, south korea and taiwan, and countries that didn't was the fact that, in the former, people were actively encouraged to wear masks outdoors  when should you wear a mask?  we are being advised to wear a face covering when using public transport, but you might want to get into the habit of wearing a simple home-made mask whenever you're in a busy public area.  one of the clear differences between countries that controlled the initial spread of the virus, such as china, south korea and taiwan, and countries that didn't was the fact that, in the former, people were actively encouraged to wear masks outdoors.  one study suggested that if 80 per cent of people wear masks that are only 60 per cent effective then that alone could stop the pandemic.  the reason that wearing simple, homemade masks has such a big impact on transmission of the virus is not so much because they will protect the wearer (though they might, particularly if someone coughs directly in your face), but more because they will dramatically reduce the amount of droplets someone who is infected will spray around if they happen to have covid-19 — particularly if they are asymptomatic and are infected with the virus but show no symptoms at all.  a key superpower this virus possesses is its ability to infect your throat and turn you into a 'superspreader' long before you even realise you are infected.  what wearing a mask out in public does is dramatically reduce that risk.  if you have covid-19 and cough on someone from eight inches away, wearing a cotton mask will reduce the amount of virus you transmit to that person by 36 times.  so if you wear a mask there is a chance that you will be saving a lot of lives.  your mask doesn't have to be sophisticated or medical grade to be effective.  a basic mask made out of an old t-shirt combined with a liner of kitchen paper would be good enough.  but you will only stand the best chance of protecting yourself if you use the mask properly.  that means making sure you wash your hands thoroughly before you put it on, then resisting all temptation to touch, fiddle with or adjust it while the mask is in place.  as soon as you get home, first wash your hands, then carefully remove the mask and put it in the wash (ideally at 60c), and wash your hands again.  if you are out (at work or in the car), sanitise your hands before and after removing the mask, and put it in a sealed bag until you can get home to wash it.  from filling your fridge with immunity bolstering foods to throwing open windows and regularly wiping your mobile phone, we show you how to ensure that your home remains a safe, covid-free zone  as lockdown gradually begins to ease, we are now at increased risk of picking up the virus and bringing it into our homes, so it's never been more important to take steps to ensure your home is kept meticulously virus-free to minimise your chance of spreading infection among other members of your household. from filling your fridge with immunity bolstering foods to throwing open windows and regularly wiping your mobile phone, we show you how to ensure that your home remains a safe, covid-free zone.  kitchen  cleaning  disinfect surfaces which are touched frequently (door handles and kitchen counters).  you can wipe down with a diluted bleachbased disinfectant, but an alcoholbased cleaner or soapy water can be as effective because soap breaks down and destroys the virus's outer shell.  cleaning cloths and sponges are not likely to be covid-carriers, but they are the biggest reservoir of microbes in your whole house. so wash them in a bleach-based disinfectant.  shopping  ordering a food delivery is a safer option than going to a supermarket — but it's not entirely risk-free.  if the person who collected your order has contaminated hands, the virus could transfer on to your food packaging.  however, the coronavirus does not replicate outside the body, so by the time your food is delivered, it is likely to have become less infectious.  we also have good evidence that just ten minutes in the sunshine kills most viruses on most surfaces, so you might want to leave packages in the sun for a short while.  if you do go to a supermarket, wear a mask.  try to avoid touching your face as you shop and, if you are driving, give your hands a wipe when you leave the shop.  cups & plates  if someone in your household becomes ill, keep a separate set of plates and cutlery for them and wash these separately.  washing clothes  the virus can survive for two to three days, indoors, on plastic and stainless steel, but it doesn't live anything like as long on porous fabric surfaces (such as clothes and furnishings).  the holes in textiles trap the coronavirus and prevent it being transferred so easily.  even so, hygiene experts i've spoken to recommend washing clothes more than we normally would.  if you are concerned you might have been in contact with an infected person, then wash your clothes at 60c.  be careful not to shake the clothes before putting them in the machine as this could disperse virus particles.  disposable masks should be binned after use, and home-made masks put in the wash after every use.  fridge  make sure to empty your fridge of tempting sugary snacks which contribute to weight gain.  being overweight significantly increases your risk of complications if you do get covid-19.  instead, top it up with immunity-bolstering foods.  our favourites include red peppers, which contain three times as much vitamin c as an orange. also try live yoghurt and oily fish.  entrance hall  outdoor clothes  if you do a high-risk job, such as nursing, or you are a taxi driver, you might want to put a box by your front door for outdoor shoes and jackets.  this means you can remove potentially infected outer clothing as soon as you return home.  post  the virus can, theoretically, last 24 hours on cardboard, but post and packages are not considered a high-risk route of transmission.  ask the person delivering them to keep their distance, wash your hands after opening, and then throw packaging away.  mobiles  unlike hands — which are, hopefully, regularly washed — almost three-quarters of people have never cleaned their phone.  a study in the journal of travel medicine and infectious disease found that 68 per cent of mobile phones are contaminated with viruses and bacteria, including some phones that were harbouring antibiotic-resistant bugs.  the report concluded that our mobile phones could be having a 'large and largely unacknowledged impact on spreading infection in the community'.  apple recommends clorox disinfecting wipes, but anything that contains more than 70 per cent alcohol will be fine. do not use water or bleach.  bags  keep your bag on your lap when using public transport.  wipe down your purse or wallet regularly with an alcohol-based wipe, and wash or sanitise your hands before applying lip balm or make-up on the move to avoid introducing germs that may have settled on those items into your eyes or mouth.  keep any food in a bag or sealed box, and wash or sanitise hands before eating.  although the risk of picking up or transferring the virus on a bank card is low, it's a good idea to wipe cards once a week.  wipe down your purse or wallet regularly with an alcohol-based wipe, and wash or sanitise your hands before applying lip balm or make-up on the move to avoid introducing germs that may have settled on those items into your eyes or mouth  downstairs loo  now we can entertain outside, there may be the need for family or friends to use the loo.  wipe all surfaces, including flush levers and taps, with bleach solution or disinfectant spray before guests arrive and change the hand towel.  do the same again when they leave, washing hand towels at 60c. there's no need to clean the loo each time it's used.  bedroom  windows  open windows/doors whenever possible. government advice says the virus is less likely to be passed on in well-ventilated buildings and outdoors.  now it is warmer, leave windows and doors open.  virus droplets quickly disperse in fresh air, and smaller particles which float in the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed will dry more quickly if there's a breeze.  rubbish  if someone in your house is ill, ask them to put any tissues or wipes in a rubbish bag and tie the top. keep this separate from other waste for 72 hours before putting in the household waste bin.  sweeter dreams  wash sheets regularly at 60c (90c for whites).  if someone in your house has symptoms, ask them to put dirty bed linen and towels in a bag and wait 72 hours before washing it.  leave clean linen outside their room. wash hands after touching items from their room  sitting room  tv remotes  just like your mobile phone, a tv remote and gaming handsets can harbour bugs, so give them an occasional wipe with disinfectant.  house plants  i love having house plants around and there is evidence that they can improve the quality of air in any room.  there's even a hit list of top 'air cleaning' plants devised by scientists at nasa who found that house plants are not only good at absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, but can remove volatile organic pollutants from the air, such as benzene and xylene, found in furnishings, cleaning products and air fresheners.  english (or common) ivy, snake plants, aloe vera and broadleaf lady palms all made it onto the list. if you have breathing problems, plants are great humidity regulators for our dry, centrally heated homes.  whether the air is dry, or your room tends to be damp, plants help to balance out moisture levels. humidity and good indoor air circulation have been shown to help prevent the spread of viruses.  home office  keyboards and shared laptops and tablets are a potential source of cross-infection, so give them an occasional wipe down. use an alcohol-based wipe or a dry cloth with disinfectant spray.  books, magazines & newspapers  the virus cannot be transmitted on newspapers, but avoid licking a finger when you turn the pages (in case you transfer virus particles that you might have picked up elsewhere into your mouth).  glasses of wine  the odd glass of wine is fine, but drinking too much will impact your immunity (alcohol abuse is connected with an increased incidence of infectious diseases).  bathroom  washing hands  the key to protecting your home and your loved ones is to wash your hands thoroughly when you return from being outside.  i'm sure you know the drill by now, but in case you don't, you should lather your hands, rubbing the backs and between fingers, 'scratching' each palm with the nails of the other hand to get soap under the nails.  keep going for 20 seconds (or as long as it takes to sing happy birthday twice). then rinse your hands under clean running water.  i make a point of washing my hands regularly throughout the day (after every trip to the lavatory, before cooking, before eating, and after wearing a face mask). it a good habit to get in to.  bathroom scales  weigh yourself every week so you can tell if your weight is creeping up. as well as longterm health problems, being overweight increases your risk of complications from covid19. it's far easier to bring any dietary slips back into line if you monitor your weight.  shower/bath  the virus doesn't cling well to hair, so there's no need to wash your hair after you've been out and about, but do tie back long hair so you're less inclined to touch your face.  shower daily, as normal, but ensure that everyone in the house has their own towel, which is washed regularly at 60c.  if someone in your family contracts the virus, try to confine them to their own bathroom if possible, or be vigilant about wiping all surfaces including taps and the toilet flush with a bleach solution.  ... and outside  your car  keep a bottle of hand sanitiser in your glove compartment for on-the-move clean-ups.  a pack of disinfecting wipes is also handy so you can wipe the gear stick and steering wheel, door handles and any commonly used buttons when you return to the car after being out if you or a member of your family might have been in contact with the virus.  this will stop any particles transferring from your hands to the car interior, and being potentially brought into your house with you when you get home.  ideally, don't share a car journey with anyone outside of your close family group unless you absolutely have to.  if you do have to travel with someone else, use a face mask and keep a window open when driving.  according to the office for national statistics, security guards and taxi drivers are the workers most at risk of dying from covid-19. it is hard to keep a safe distance in a car.  garden & patio  if you are lucky enough to have a garden, do take the opportunity to soak up some sunshine.  even if you are wearing suntan lotion, it is the best way to top up your vitamin d levels, which are likely to be depleted after a long winter.  vitamin d is important for building and regulating your immune system.  getting a blast of uv light in the morning is also a great way to set your circadian clock, which ensures good restorative sleep.  sunlight, as i mentioned before, is a great way to kill any of the virus that happens to be hanging around on packages or other surfaces, mainly because the ultraviolet end of the light spectrum breaks up its vulnerable genetic material.  so do enjoy the sun, safely, this summer!  but such is the demand for a covid-19 jab that more than 100 vaccines have gone into development in record time, and several are already being tested on humans  race for a vaccine  with a deadly new virus stalking the planet, the race for a safe, effective vaccine is like nothing ever seen before. in normal times, the process would take at least five years due to rigorous testing and regulation — 95 per cent of potential vaccines fail.  but such is the demand for a covid-19 jab that more than 100 vaccines have gone into development in record time, and several are already being tested on humans.  the good news is that with so many vaccines against covid-19 in development, and with so much money behind them, it is possible that at least one will come through the scrupulous testing required, if not by the end of 2020, certainly by 2021.  but there are huge challenges for the laboratories to overcome.  some of these vaccines are quite traditional, based on the principle of using a dead or weakened strain of the virus to give the immune system advance warning so it is better prepared when it comes face to face with the actual disease.  but other groups are going down a fascinatingly different route.  the imperial approach  professor robin shattock works in the department of infectious disease at imperial college london.  for many years he has worked on aids, pioneering the use of drugs and passive antibodies to treat and prevent hiv transmission.  robin and his team began by identifying the genetic sequence of the spikes that cover the surface of the virus.  it is these crown-like spikes which give the virus its name (corona = crown) and which make it so successful at latching on to cells in our body.  they have created a vaccine made of genetic material which, when injected into animals, makes their cells churn out viral spikes.  robin and his team hope the presence of the spikes (without the virus) in the body will be enough to alert the immune system and prepare it to face a real virus covered in the same barbs.  'the great advantage of this approach is it tricks the immune system into thinking it has seen the whole virus,' explains robin.  when they injected their vaccine into mice it worked even better than expected, encouraging the mice to develop antibodies to fight covid-19 within two weeks.  the experts are now awaiting the results of studies done in monkeys and hope to begin human trials this month.  other laboratories around the world are using a similar approach. one of the current leaders, a company called ­moderna, has teamed up with the vaccine research center at the national institutes of health in the u.s.  they were very quick off the blocks and began a small human trial with their vaccine on march 15. early results look promising.  the vaccine seems to be safe (none of the volunteers suffered side-effects).  it is also clearly having an effect, as the first eight volunteers tested were producing decent levels of antibodies which bind to viruses in the blood and stop them infecting more cells.  it is early days, but moderna plans to hold bigger human trials this month.  dreaming spires to the rescue  another major research group is based at oxford university's jenner institute, led by sarah gilbert, professor of vaccinology.  this vaccine also uses the covid-19 spikes, to spark an immune reaction against the real virus.  this vaccine is, however, based on a harmless common cold virus, which has been genetically modified to produce covid-19's distinctive viral spikes.  in a 2019 study, the team showed that their genetically modified virus was safe and could induce a good immune response to mers (middle east respiratory syndrome, a deadly infection that is also caused by a coronavirus) and human trials began in saudi arabia last december.  they swiftly modified their existing vaccine so it would work against covid-19 and by march were ready to test on monkeys.  six were given a single shot of the oxford vaccine and mounted a good immune response, remaining healthy after being exposed to a heavy dose of the virus. encouraged, the oxford group began human trials with more than 1,000 volunteers in april.  they await confirmation that the vaccine is safe and that the volunteers produced antibodies to the virus.  professor gilbert is confident it will work and the group has linked up with biopharmaceutical giant astrazeneca to prepare for the manufacture of tens of millions of doses when the trials are complete.  what are the next steps?  once it has been established that a vaccine is safe (with few, or no side-effects) and triggers a good immune response, the crucial test is to see if it works.  this is difficult because self-isolating means there is not much covid-19 about, so they are also testing it on health workers, who are more likely to get exposed.  they might even need to trial it in another country where the virus is more active.  or volunteers could be vaccinated, then deliberately exposed to covid-19 to see if the vaccine protects them.  to minimise the risk, they would have to be young and healthy, and at low risk of complications if they did get the virus.  they would also have to be closely monitored and get the best possible care if something did go wrong. ideally, drugs that could help would be to hand (many antiviral drugs are currently undergoing trials).  finally, volunteers could be recruited from a group likely to become exposed to the virus anyway, such as frontline medical workers.  we already expect them to risk themselves by treating patients with covid-19. is this really that different?  when i was a medical student i took part in studies when healthy volunteers were needed to test for potential side effects of new drugs.  if i was in my 20s, i would certainly volunteer.  how long would a vaccine last?  although the vaccine might not give lifelong immunity, there are good reasons to hope its effects will last for at least a year.  a chinese study of 176 people who got sars, which is caused by a related coronavirus, found they maintained good levels of antibody against the virus for a couple of years, and some for up to 14 years.  5 of the best for immunity green leafy veg (spinach or kale) a good source of iron — vital for building your red blood cells that carry oxygen in the blood to other organs in your body. it also plays a vital role in building your white cells, which are a key part of your immune system. green vegetables are packed with vitamins and fibre which your gut bacteria uses to regulate your immune response. peppers red or yellow, these have — weight for weight — three times as much vitamin c as oranges. vitamin c is an antioxidant which also plays a vital role in launching an effective immune response, plus it also helps by aiding the absorption of iron from your food. brazil nuts the best source of the mineral selenium. this is a powerful antioxidant, which reduces chronic inflammation and enhances immunity. many brits are low on selenium, which can put you at risk of infection. however, a handful of nuts a few times a week will give you all you need. mushrooms research shows that people low inlevels of vitamin d could be at more risk of covid complications. we get most of our vitamin d from sunshine, but if you put any mushrooms (fresh, dried, whole or sliced) on a sunny windowsill for a few hours before eating, that will really boost their vitamin d levels. salmon oily fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids that have powerful anti-inflammatory effects, which help dampen down an overactive immune response. if you do not like fish, then nibble on some seaweed snacks instead (fish get their omega-3 from seaweed).  adapted by louise atkinson from covid-19, what you need to know about the coronavirus and the race for the vaccine by dr michael mosley, published by short books at £6.99. © 2020 michael mosley"
health,"the uk has announced 113 more covid-19 deaths today, the lowest since lockdown began, taking the official count to 38,489.  today the department of health reported the lowest figure in almost ten weeks - 74 people died on march 23, after which the crisis spiralled out of control.  however, the weekends always see a significant drop in deaths due to a lag in reporting. last sunday health officials declared 118 deaths, which was a 30 per cent drop from the week before.  today has not seen such a dramatic reduction from the week before. but deaths are still declining from the peak in mid-april when the worst day saw 1,172 people die.  dr jenny harries, the deputy chief medical officer for england, warned it was a 'critical time' for following social distancing rules as england moves into the next phase of the lockdown from tomorrow.  already thousands have flocked to crowded beaches and beauty spots this weekend to enjoy the hot weather ahead of the rule changes.  dr harries admitted it was worrying that people may be 'cramming into cars' sharing cutlery on the beach and being very close together, amid scientists' warnings the relaxation of measures will 'inevitably' cause cases to surge.  the next step will also allow more than two million extremely vulnerable people in england who have been shielding for weeks to spend time outside, the communities secretary robert jenrick confirmed today.  speaking at the downing street briefing, mr jenrick said from tomorrow those people will be able to see a relative again or go for a walk, as long as they socially distance.  dr jenny harries, the deputy chief medical officer for england, admitted it was worrying that people may be 'cramming into cars' sharing cutlery on the beach and being very close together this weekend, after the hot weather drew crowds to beauty spots  in other coronavirus developments today:  robert jenrick pledged 6,000 new homes will be made available to rough sleepers to protect them from the virus;  the department of health said testing capacity in the uk had reached 200,000, but just 112,000 of those are for people with symptoms;  nicola sturgeon accused england of under-reporting deaths in care homes, saying that is why scotland's figures look worse;  the pm has praised the public's 'resilience' as families across england will finally be able to see their elderly relatives again tomorrow, with millions of vulnerable people 'shielding' are given the green light to spend time outdoors;  chief science officer patrick vallance insisted ministers make final decisions on policy as he defended his sage advisory group from rising criticism;  chancellor rishi sunak is drawing up an emergency budget for july amid fears that the economy is descending into meltdown;  police and local authorities have seen beaches, parks and beauty spots crammed today, despite government advisers appealing for people not to 'knock the pants out' of new rules;  unions dismissed the idea that school summer holidays should be cancelled to allow pupils to catch up, saying teachers deserved time off after working 'flat out' during lockdown.  how is the lockdown being eased in england from monday? what's changing? from monday, people can meet outside in groups of up to six as long as those from different households continue to socially distance. - can i visit family and friends? yes . this means that family groups of no more than six can meet in parks and private gardens for chats and even barbecues. - how far am i allowed to travel? there are no mileage limits set for how far you are allowed to drive to visit family and friends in england, northern ireland and scotland, but the general advice is to remain in your local area as much as possible. however, people in wales will still not be allowed to travel more than five miles from their home for any reason except work or to purchase essentials. great, can we hug? sadly no. you still cannot risk infection by being too close. the same goes for handshakes or kissing. if young children from different households are part of the group, they must not share paddling pools, climbing frames, slides or anything that would encourage them to be closer than two metres to each other. can i stay overnight? staying overnight at someone else's home will still not be allowed anywhere in the uk, while even going indoors for any other reason than to access a garden or use the bathroom is prohibited. however scottish first minister nicola sturgeon has advised that if the distance travelled to meet someone means that you have to use their bathroom, then 'perhaps you shouldn't be doing it'. can we barbecue? yes, but you must wash your hands, be careful about passing food or plates and keep 6ft apart. how about entering their house? only if there is no other way of getting to the back of the property. what about using the toilet? you can, but you must thoroughly clean any surfaces you touch. to be extra safe, you could even use a paper towel to open and close bathroom doors and perhaps consider using a kitchen roll to dry hands rather than a towel. so what if it rains? you will have to stand under an umbrella or leave. you cannot shelter in someone else's home. can we camp in the garden? no, boris johnson said he did not want you to stay overnight. do i only have to see the same group? no, you can meet different people at different times, but try not to see too many in quick succession. can those shielding take part? no, they must continue to shield if they're in the clinically extremely vulnerable group and have had a letter from their gp. what about the over-70s? if they are not in the shielding group. we are a family of six – can we meet anyone else? no. the guidelines say you can meet only up to six people at any one time. can we visit a relative in a care home garden? it would depend on circumstances and the care home's management. - what else will i be allowed to do under the new measures? in england, monday's lockdown easing will signal the reopening of schools to allow students in nurseries, early-years settings, and reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class. some shops are also set to reopen, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations. - when might restrictions be eased further? boris johnson has flagged that more restrictions will be eased on june 15, beginning with the reopening of other non-essential retail shops such as fashion or homeware retail. other businesses, such as pubs, hairdressers and cinemas will have to wait until july before they can reopen, the government has previously said. advertisement  despite the death toll reaching 38,489, back-dated data from death certificates shows more than 46,000 people had been killed by the virus by may 15, 36 per cent more than the official toll given by the department of health (33,998) at that time.  if the same mathematical sum was applied to today's official count of 38,489, it would suggest the true death toll currently is around the 51,000 mark.  there have been 274,762 positive test results since the crisis began. but this is a tiny fraction of the millions who would have been infected and never got a test.  department of health said that testing capacity reached the prime minister's 200,000 target yesterday, despite only 115,700 tests being conducted.  officials said the 200,000 includes the ability to do only around 112,000 diagnostic tests, including home testing kits, drive-through sites, and mobile testing units dealt with by laboratories, per day.  it's unclear how the marginal increase (12,000 since the end of april) will support the new contact tracing system which launched on friday.  dr harries said at this afternoon's press briefing: 'we have testing capacity up to 200,000, so we have lots of available use as we move into our test and track system.'  when boris johnson pledged to run 200,000 tests per day by june on may 6, downing street said hours later the figure referred to testing capacity rather than the actual number of tests completed.  the government was accused of ‘bending the rules’ to reach its initial coronavirus testing target of 100,000 per day by the end of april by including home testing kits that had been sent out, but not processed.  testing continues to fall short of the pm’s own promise as long ago as 25 march that test numbers would 'very soon' reach 250,000 per day.  there are still 54,000 new infections happening each week - down from 61,000 per week at the start of may - and 133,000 people are thought to currently have the virus. this means one in 1,000 people are still catching it.  the prime minister says the government's five tests have been met and it is safe to start relaxing restrictions from tomorrow. but the alert level remains at four - which suggests they should stay in place.  from tomorrow, up to six people from six different households permitted to meet up in public places or gardens, putting exercise classes and barbecues back on the agenda.  crowds have flocked to beaches and parks this weekend in defiance of the lockdown rules that remain in place until monday.  they were tempted by temperatures that soared to 80f (27c) with the country enjoying the sunniest spring since records began and the driest may since 1862.  official mobility data shows the number of people venturing out to parks has increased far above pre-lockdown levels as people look to socialise in outdoor spaces.  mr jenrick was asked how worried he is having seen pictures this weekend where social distancing has been difficult or impossible at the downing street briefing today.  he said: 'we're reasonably confident that the steps we've taken and will be taking on monday are manageable but we have to all continue to play our part in that because the rate of infection remains somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9 and the room for manoeuvre is quite limited.  'we'll obviously keep this under very close scrutiny as we move into this next phase and as we approach the next decision point on june 15.'  when asked why lockdown rules are being relaxed ahead of the uk reaching the green level 3 of the covid alert system, mr jenrick said the latest steps are 'cautious, modest ones entirely consistent with the message the prime minister delivered'.  mr jenrick said: 'the alert level is changing. we are still at level 4 but we're transitioning to level 3 and that does enable us to very cautiously open some businesses and aspects of our daily lives.'  dr harries added that despite the easing in restrictions, 'the public really, really need to stick to those messages' of social distancing and limiting exposure to other people.  from tomorrow, families across england will finally be able to see their relatives or friends who have been ‘shielding’ for months, mr jenrick confirmed this afternoon.  as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, 2.2million vulnerable people will be take 'small changes' after spending weeks inside.  guidelines will say they can go outside and meet one other members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines.  those being shielded are warned they still remain at risk and are advised to leave the house only once a day. they should not go to work or the shops and avoid crowded places.  mr jenrick said the relaxation of shielding will have a 'huge impact' on people's mental health and wellbeing, while ensuring face-to-face contact is kept to a minimum.  dr harries emphasised that the shielding guidance is 'very much advice' that doesn't need to be followed, and that 'nothing will ever be 100 per cent safe'.  dominic raab also played down criticism that the curbs are being downgraded despite the government's own coronavirus alert system level remaining at four - which suggests they should stay in place  apple mobility tracker also shows a surge in the amount of travel across the uk as the lockdown begins to be eased  a series of experts have raised concern about the move to ease lockdown from westminster - which has not been replicated in scotland or wales.  thousands of new homes for rough sleepers communities secretary robert jenrick pledged to build thousands of new homes to shelter rough sleepers. at this afternoon's downing street briefing, mr jenrick said ministers were looking at the next steps after the pandemic, having been able to offer accommodation to over 90 per cent of the homeless since the start of the crisis. mr jenrick said: 'some people will need help to return to the private rental sector, but others will need accommodation to be provided so that they can start to rebuild their lives. 'that's why 6,000 new supported homes will be made available for rough sleepers, providing safe accommodation for people we've helped off the streets during the pandemic.' the government will back the initiative and give £433million to fast track securing safe accommodation. mr jenrick said 3,300 of the 'homes' will become available in the next 12 months, and £160million will be spent to deliver that. 'but rough sleeping is as much a health issue, as it is a housing issue. it's a crisis of addiction and mental health as well,' he said. 'so we will provide specialist support staff for rough sleepers in this new accommodation to ensure that they can continue to receive the health support that they will need to transform their lives and fulfil their potential.' head of the covid-19 rough sleeping taskforce dame louise casey warned that 'the pandemic is not over' and vulnerable people must still be protected. 'for homeless people the task was to bring as many people in off the streets and out of communal shelters,' she told the downing street press conference. 'the goal was to protect rough sleepers from the virus, give them the chance to self-isolate and ultimately therefore do the best we can to save their lives.'  it will be around two or three weeks before the effects of the latest easing of restrictions is known, but prof devi sridhar, who has been advising the scottish government, warned it looks 'inevitable' that cases will rise again in england.  'i'm very sorry to say that i think it is right now inevitable looking at the numbers,' she told sky.  'if your objective is to contain the virus, to drive numbers down and to try to in a sense get rid of it so no-one is exposed to it, then it is not the right measure right now to open up.  'it's a big risk and gamble for exiting lockdown with a larger number of deaths than we did when we actually entered lockdown months back.'  prof sridhar said there was now a clear divide between government and some scientists, but added that ultimately decisions will be made by politicians.  she said: 'i think what they should be saying is they consider the science, and hopefully they listen to it but the decision, and who actually has the accountability, are the politicians and leaders.'  professor peter openshaw, who sits on the the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (nervtag) to the government, said people must proceed with 'great caution' as the lockdown is eased.  he told the bbc's andrew marr programme: 'at the moment, we still have quite a large number of cases out there in the community and i think unlocking too fast carries a great risk that all the good work that's been put in by everyone, to try to reduce transmission may be lost. so we do need to proceed with great, great care at this point.'  asked if the government is going too fast, he said: 'i think there is a pretty unanimous message now that we need to take this slowly and go step by step. we need to evaluate the effect of each step before we move to the next one.'  england's deputy chief medical officer yesterday pleaded with britons 'not to tear the pants out of' the loosened lockdown when more freedoms are granted on monday.  professor jonathan van-tam warned that abusing new liberties would fuel the spread of infection and said that the lifting of curbs should be treated as if gently lifting the lid on a coiled spring - 'painstakingly' slow.  the top scientific adviser said the country was at a 'very dangerous moment' in the crisis, as thousands of sun-seekers packed on to beaches to bask in scorching weather.  professor john edmunds, an epidemiologist at the school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said the prime minister had 'clearly made a political decision' because the threat of a second peak remains high.  two other sage experts lined up behind professor edmunds on saturday to caution that measures were being relaxed when the infection rate was still not low enough.  but the chair of the government's sage board has said it is for the government to decide when to ease lockdown measures.  dr jenny harries, the deputy chief medical officer for england, warned it was a 'critical time' to not 'over do it' when it comes to relaxing social distancing. pictured: people enjoying the weather at ruislip lido in london today  england is set to move into the next phase of the lockdown from tomorrow, with up to six people able to meet, despite scientists' fears it will cause a second wave of infections. pictured: people at three shires head on the river dane, derbyshire  as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, 2.2 million vulnerable people will be able to go outside with members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. pictured: visitors and sunbathers flock to durdle door at lulworth in dorset on a scorching hot sunny day  people in england have been urged not to 'tear the pants out' of new looser lockdown rules. pictured,sunseekers in parsons green, fulham yesterday evening  uk must 'improve' it's coronavirus situation before holidaying to spain brits' hopes of holidaying abroad have been dashed as spain's tourism minister says the uk must 'improve' its situation with coronavirus before tourists are allowed back. maria reyes maroto said british tourists will not be among those participating in a proposed trial-run for allowing tourists back into the country. the first tourism test-run is due to take place in two weeks, ahead of the reopening of spanish borders to holidaymakers from july 1. the news comes after the government has faced increasing pressure to scrap its scheme forcing all travellers arriving in the uk to spend 14 days in quarantine. tourism and aviation industries have warned the measures could scupper any hopes of economic recovery and there is now a growing number of ministers and tory mps demanding home secretary priti patel rethink the plans. instead, she said tourists from germany and the nordic countries were the most likely to be permitted entry for the trial. the tourism minister said the spanish and regional government were in talks with holiday providers tui and jet2holidays about the prospect of brits returning to the country. the mirror reported she told spanish media the likelihood of holidaymakers from the uk being the first to visit spain were slim: 'there the health situation still has to improve. 'for us it is important to guarantee that people arrive healthy and leave healthy.'  writing in the sunday telegraph, sir patrick vallance, who heads up the advisory board of scientists guiding the government through this pandemic, explained sage was only there to advise politicians, who have the final say on what to do with evidence presented to them.  sir patrick, the chief scientific adviser to the government since march 2018, wrote: 'science advice to cobr and to ministers needs to be direct and given without fear or favour. but it is advice. ministers must decide and have to take many other factors into consideration.'  dominic raab has also come to the government's defense on easing coronavirus lockdown in england, despite a chorus of warnings about a second spike. but he admitted that curbs will have to be tightened again if there is an 'uptick' in cases.  asked whether the lockdown will be tightened again if infection rates increase, mr raab told sky's ridge on sunday: 'we will target, if there is any uptick, and it could be in a locality, it could be in a particular setting, we will target very carefully measures that would apply to it so that we can take these steps but also keep control of the virus.'  the foreign secretary acknowledged the loosening that takes effect tomorrow is a 'sensitive moment', but insisted the government was making sensible changes to get the country back up and running.  'we can't just stay in lockdown forever. we have got to transition,' he said.  mr raab played down fears that the curbs are being downgraded even though the government's own coronavirus alert system level remains at four.  nicola sturgeon has stressed she is being more 'cautious' and the virus can still 'run out of control'.  asked on sky news whether she thought that the pm was loosening the lockdown in england too quickly, ms sturgeon insisted she did not want to 'criticise other politicians' and they were all 'trying to do the right things'.  but she pointedly said that in scotland they were being 'very cautious'. 'this virus has not gone away,' she said. 'that is why in scotland we are moving very slowly.'  she also today accused england of under-reporting care home deaths as she swiped at mr johnson for easing lockdown too early.  the scottish first minister said the apparent higher proportion of victims in care homes north of the border was due to the way they are recorded.  she insisted that people who died of stroke and 'happened' to have coronavirus were counted in the numbers in scotland - whereas they were not in england, meaning that there was 'under-reporting'.  britain abandoned test and trace in march because it could only handle five new cases per week britain abandoned test and tracing for the coronavirus earlier in the pandemic because the system could only cope with five cases a week, it has emerged. official documents from the government's sage advisory committee reveal that the routine testing and tracing of contacts of people with the virus was stopped because public health england was facing a desperate shortage of capacity. since the first covid-19 cases were confirmed in york on january 31, 272,826 people in the uk have since tested positive for the virus. this week the government launched the nhs england's test and trace programme, with 25,000 contact tracing staff and the capacity to trace the 10,000 contacts per day. the decision to scrap routine testing for those displaying symptoms 12 weeks ago is now being seen as a major factor for how the uk has the fifth-highest total number of infections. sage documents show how, in a meeting on february 18, advisors said that public health england (phe) could only manage the contacts of five covid cases a week, hoping to possibly increase this to 50 people. minutes from the meeting say: 'currently phe can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).  on the eve of year 1 and year 6 pupils returning to school, ministers are being put under pressure to massively speed up coronavirus testing.  the contact tracing programme was put into motion on friday, with a website launching so anyone with symptoms can record it with health chiefs.  an approach that was abandoned in the second week of march when officials realised the virus was out of control, test and trace will make sure everyone with symptoms gets tested and, if they test positive, government employees will track down everyone they have been in contact with and tell them to self-isolate for two weeks.  on friday, the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) said tracers should aim to have contacts of confirmed cases isolating within 48 to 72 hours of a test taking place.  any delay beyond that would have a ‘significant impact’ on the ability to stem the virus, they said.  but currently almost half of test results are failing to come back within 48 hours, leaving the new army of 25,000 contact tracers racing to get in touch with contacts of newly confirmed cases in time.  delays can mean chains of infection could quickly spread – thwarting plans to ease lockdown restrictions.  but experts last night said long delays for test results were still the norm, meaning efforts to trace contacts would come far too late as these individuals could already have passed the virus on to others by then.  it comes as a health chief warned at least 10 per cent of britons will ignore requests to self-isolate when contacted by nhs covid tracers.  professor isabel oliver, who helped design the government's tracing app to track those who are at risk of being infected, told the sunday telegraph: 'this has been a very prolonged outbreak.  one in ten britons will ignore self isolation rules at least 10 per cent of britons will ignore requests to self-isolate when contacted by nhs covid tracers, a health chief has warned. professor isabel oliver helped design the government's tracing app to track those who are at risk of being infected. the director of the field epidemiology service at public health england told the sunday telegraph that though most people are willing to comply, a minority will disobey instructions. it is thought that lockdown fatigue will cause people to ignore advice offered to them. 'this has been a very prolonged outbreak,' she said. 'invariably we find that everyone is very willing to help, but these are exceptional circumstances, with an outbreak that has been so prolonged and had such an extensive impact on the people's lives, so it is understanding that some people will be resistant. 'but having said that we are finding that lots of people are supportive and we are very grateful for that because for the programme to be successful in controlling the virus - we need that support from the nation as a whole.' test and trace launched in england on thursday and professor oliver's team immediately hit a wall of it problems. but she stressed that any delays to having tracers logged in was down to the fact that the app is run on a 'very secure system'.  'invariably we find that everyone is very willing to help, but these are exceptional circumstances, with an outbreak that has been so prolonged and had such an extensive impact on the people's lives, so it is understanding that some people will be resistant.  'but having said that we are finding that lots of people are supportive and we are very grateful for that because for the programme to be successful in controlling the virus - we need that support from the nation as a whole.'  the concerns come amid reports that scammers are falsely alerting people that they have coronavirus in a bid to steal their data.  the government today said that it was unable to say how many people have been tracked and traced using the software.  professor edmunds has warned that, even if the 'untested' contact tracing scheme goes smoothly, the country could still suffer 80 deaths a day until a vaccine is developed.  former world health organisation director professor anthony costello has predicted a resurgence of the virus without adequate contact tracing.  in a scathing tweet on saturday, professor costello said: 'we have 8,000 cases daily, a private testing system set up without connection to primary care, call-centre tracing that appears a fiasco, and no digital app. after 4 months. unless the population has hidden (t cell?) immunity, we're heading for resurgence.'  it could be another month before the scheme is workable at a local level - which has been regarded as crucial for managing outbreaks locally."
health,"a simple blood test could help flag when men with prostate cancer are not responding to treatment or are more likely to relapse.  the 'liquid biopsy' was evaluated for efficiency on more than 1,000 blood samples from 216 men with advanced prostate cancer who were having treatment.  researchers led by the institute of cancer research (icr) in london found the test can detect traces of cancer dna in the bloodstream.  high levels predicted the disease would progress more rapidly, while large reductions over time suggested treatment was working.  it could lead to tailored treatment for those in the advanced stages of the disease and help doctors decide when to stop drug that aren't working as well.  liquid biopsies are also a less painful and less invasive method than commonly-used tissue biopsies.  a simple blood test could help flag when men with prostate cancer are not responding to treatment or are more likely to relapse (stock)  the study looked at blood samples from men who were part of a clinical trial of the targeted drug abiraterone with or without an experimental drug, ipatasertib.  the results showed that men with high levels of tumour dna at the start of treatment had a significantly worse outcome.  their disease progressed two and a half months earlier than those negative for 'ctdna' at the start of treatment.  the team looked at blood samples over the course of the treatment with repeated tests, and found those who responded to treatment had the greatest fall in the amount of cancer dna in their bloodstream.  cancer dna dropped by 23 per cent - while those who partially responded to treatment had a reduction of 16 per cent.  men whose prostate cancer continued to get worse or stayed the same only saw a reduction of one per cent or four per cent, respectively.  scientists also found, through analysis of dna from the blood tests, there were specific genetic changes in the blood that indicated drug resistance. this would suggest a man was at risk of early relapse.  professor johann de bono, professor of experimental cancer medicine at the icr and consultant medical oncologist at the royal marsden trust, said: 'our study shows that a simple blood test could help us track how cancer evolves and responds to treatment - initially as part of clinical trials and eventually in routine care.  'these so-called liquid biopsy tests are minimally invasive, cost-effective and can be performed often and with ease.  'tracking prostate cancer with a blood test instead of a painful surgical biopsy could significantly improve patients' quality of life.'  professor paul workman, chief executive of the icr, said: 'these simple blood tests detect traces of cancer circulating in the bloodstream and help us anticipate cancer's next move.  'they can help doctors come up with personalised treatment plans and to stay one step ahead of the disease.  'this study showcases the value of liquid biopsies for guiding therapy. they are a faster, kinder, more flexible alternative to traditional tissue biopsies and are set to become a gold standard for cancer treatment.'  prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the uk, with more than 47,500 men diagnosed every year, according to prostate cancer uk.  the research, conducted with the royal marsden nhs foundation trust, was presented at the american society of clinical oncology (asco) virtual annual meeting."
health,"advertisement  families across england will finally be able to see their elderly relatives again tomorrow, as millions of vulnerable people ‘shielding’ are allowed to spend time outdoors.  as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions, 2.2 million vulnerable people will be able to go outside with members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. those who live alone will be able to meet outside with one other person from another household, in a move that will bring joy to thousands.  boris johnson last night hailed the ‘resilience’ of those who have been shielding since march, with many having no face-to-face contact since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.  the prime minister said: ‘i want to thank everyone who has followed the

plastic visors to protect themselves from coronavirus had a picnic on the beach at ruislip lido in west london  britain abandoned test and trace for coronavirus earlier this year because officials could only handle five cases per week, sage documents show britain abandoned test and tracing for the coronavirus earlier in the pandemic because the system could only cope with five cases a week, it has emerged. official documents from the government's sage advisory committee reveal that the routine testing and tracing of contacts of people with the virus was stopped because public health england was facing a desperate shortage of capacity. since the first covid-19 cases were confirmed in york on january 31, 272,826 people in the uk have since tested positive for the virus. this week the government launched the nhs england's test and trace programme, with 25,000 contact tracing staff and the capacity to trace the 10,000 contacts per day. the decision to scrap routine testing for those displaying symptoms 12 weeks ago is now being seen as a major factor for how the uk has the fifth-highest total number of infections. sage documents show how, in a meeting on february 18, advisors said that public health england (phe) could only manage the contacts of five covid cases a week, hoping to possibly increase this to 50 people. minutes from the meeting say: 'currently phe can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts). advertisement  ‘i will do what i can, in line with the scientific advice, to continue making life easier for you over the coming weeks and months.’  the announcement came alongside a relaxing of rules to allow groups of up to six people from different households to exercise together from tomorrow.  ‘that means that people who play team sports will be able to play together, and do things like conditioning and fitness sessions that don’t involve physical contact,’ culture secretary oliver dowden said last night.  but britain’s deputy chief medical officer jonathan van-tam warned people not to take advantage of the relaxed rules.  he told yesterday’s downing street press conference: ‘this is a very dangerous moment – we have to get this right. people have to be sensible and proportionate with their freedoms.’  the updated guidance provides a much-needed boost to those most at risk who have been staying in their homes to protect themselves and the health service.  from monday, people in england can meet up to five members of another household at one time, as long as the six people meeting do so outside while keeping at least two metres apart. many schools in england are also due to open in the biggest easing of the lockdown yet.  four members of the government’s scientific advisory group on emergencies (sage) have criticised the moves, saying they are coming too soon and risk worsening the pandemic.  prof van-tam defended the easing, saying the chance of it pushing ‘r’ – the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average – above one was ‘extremely low indeed’. but he tempered his words with caution, making it clear that if people went further than the guidelines allowed, or stretched their definition, the pandemic could worsen.  ministers must massively speed up coronavirus testing or risk their contact tracing plan falling 'dead in the water', warn doctors ministers must massively speed up coronavirus testing or risk their much-vaunted contact tracing plan falling ‘dead in the water’, doctors warned last night. currently almost half of test results are failing to come back within 48 hours, leaving the new army of 25,000 tracers racing to get in touch with contacts of newly confirmed cases in time. delays can mean chains of infection could quickly spread – thwarting plans to ease lockdown restrictions. on friday, the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) said tracers should aim to have contacts of confirmed cases isolating within 48 to 72 hours of a test taking place. any delay beyond that would have a ‘significant impact’ on the ability to stem the virus, they said. but experts last night said long delays for test results were still the norm, meaning efforts to trace contacts would come far too late as these individuals could already have passed the virus on to others by then.  speaking at yesterday’s daily coronavirus briefing, he said people had a responsibility ‘to actually follow the guidance. don’t tear the pants out of it, and don’t go further than the guidance actually says’.  he gave the example of a person choosing to meet multiple groups of five from other households during different times in one day, which strictly speaking will be allowed from monday, but would be against the spirit of the guidance.  this new freedom has ‘to be taken in a reasonable measure’, he said.  he added: ‘it’s like having a spring in a box and you’ve got the lid on. now you can take the lid off a little, but you haven’t disconnected the spring or broken the spring in any way. if you take the lid right off, the spring is still under tension. off it will go again.’  the warning came as crowds flocked to beaches and parks yesterday in defiance of the lockdown rules that remained in force over the weekend.  they were tempted by temperatures that soared to 80f (27c) with the country enjoying the sunniest spring since records began and the driest may since 1862. thousands crammed on to durdle door beach in lulworth, dorset, ignoring social distancing.  four of the nation's top scientists - all on the government's sage panel of experts steering the crisis response - have also voiced concerns that lockdown is being lifted 'too early'.  prof peter horby yesterday morning lined up behind sir jeremy farrar and prof john edmunds to break ranks and caution measures were being relaxed when the infection rate was still not low enough.  prof horby also expressed serious doubts about the contact-tracing system, which has been heralded as the ticket out of blanker lockdown. he said: 'as we know, it's not yet fully operational so that is where the risk lies.'  professor john edmunds said many experts would 'prefer' to see the number of covid-19 infections drop before measures such as a relaxation on social interaction restrictions were introduced.  latest data from the office for national statistics suggests there are an estimated 54,000 new coronavirus infections a week in england outside of hospital and care settings, equating to nearly 8,000 per day.  the so-called r value, or reproduction rate, is currently between 0.7 and 0.9, and must remain under one to avoid a rise in infections - a key test on whether lockdown measures should be eased, with the government stressing the need to avoid a second wave of cases which would threaten to overwhelm the nhs.  prof edmunds, speaking during a science media centre briefing, said the decision to relax certain rules came with a degree of risk.  he said: 'i think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that would mean we have fewer cases occurring before we relaxed the measures.  'if we had incidents at a lower level, even if the reproduction level went up a bit, we wouldn't be in a position where we were overwhelming the health service.  'i think at the moment with relatively high incidents, relaxing the measures and with an untested track and trace system, i think we are taking some risk here.  'even if that risk doesn't play out and we keep the incidents flat, we're keeping it flat at quite a high level. the government has launched its track and trace system designed to limit the spread of infection by ordering contacts of those who become infected with coronavirus to isolate  prof edmunds, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, supported the decision to essentially substitute a 'blanket approach' to containing the virus with a targeted one, adding it saw a return to 'some level of normality'.  he added: 'none of us think, who have looked at this in any great detail, that that will be sufficient to be able to hold the reproduction number below one.  'we all think we will have to have quite significant numbers of wider social distance measures in place.  'the basic reproduction number for this virus is perhaps three, maybe even more, so we cannot relax our guard by very much at all.'  he said there was a need to try and get the economy restarted, to get people back to work and to provide a boost to people's mental health.  but he said even if track and trace kept the r-value at about one, it would still result in around 8,000 community infections a day in england.  government measures of support for those shielding from coronavirus will continue, including the delivery of food or medicines, phone calls and support from volunteers. to date, more than 2.25 million boxes of essential food have been delivered to those at highest risk across england, with up to 200,000 phone calls a day made to confirm their support needs are being met.  the prime minister also praised the efforts of those involved in providing care for the elderly, including 500,000 nhs volunteers.  he said: ‘i also want to recognise the hundreds of thousands of extraordinary volunteers who have supported you in shielding.  ‘whether through delivering medicines and shopping, or simply by checking in on those isolating, they should feel deeply proud of the part they have played in this collective effort.’  communities secretary robert jenrick is expected to set out plans today to review shielding guidance at regular points in the coming weeks.  shielding advice will be constantly checked at each review point for ongoing social distancing measures, with the next review set to take place later in june.  the relaxed guidance is based on the latest clinical advice, which shows the average chance of catching the virus is now one in 1,000 – down from one in 40.  those being shielded are warned they still remain at risk and are advised to leave the house only once a day. they should not go to work or the shops and avoid crowded places.  beach-goers were crammed together to make room for air ambulances to land at durdle door in dorset

bournemouth beach  hot summer could curb the spread of covid-19 as virus particles spread in water will evaporate in sunny weather, says top epidemiologist  a long, hot summer could help curb the spread of covid-19, according to a top epidemiologist.  professor keith neal of nottingham university said some virus particles were spread in minuscule specks of water that would evaporate in sunny weather.  stripped of moisture, the particles infect people for a much shorter time and surfaces are less likely to be contaminated.  ‘viruses don’t like getting dried out because it disrupts the fatty “envelope” that surrounds the protein shell,’ said prof neal. he added that very strong ultra-violet light also degraded the virus, although it was unclear if summer sunlight was intense enough.  however, the breezes of recent days may help disperse the virus. this matters because the number of particles a person is exposed to – called the viral load – is crucial.  most people’s immune systems will cope with a few dozen virus particles, but become overwhelmed when exposed to hundreds or thousands of them.  another reason that summer may help curb the virus is that people tend to socialise farther apart when they are outside.  prof neal said: ‘there’s more inherent social distancing.  ‘outside, if you’re within a metre of me, then you’re invading my personal space.’  however, he warned: ‘a warm summer won’t be any good for the virus, but how much damage it will do, we don’t know. it won’t get rid of it completely.’  mobility data shows that more britons are flocking to

for a trim on waiting lists at britain's top hair salons - as owners say they want to open in mid-june alongside other non-food retailers  if you're hoping for a haircut as soon as salons are allowed to open, prepare for disappointment – as waiting lists at some of britain’s top establishments have topped 1,000 customers.  richard ward, who styled the duchess of cambridge’s hair on her wedding day, said he has 1,200 clients on the waiting list at his chelsea salon – enough to keep his team of 100 busy for a month.  and with the list growing by 100 more hopeful customers every day, he plans to open 12 hours a day, seven days a week to try to tackle the backlog, just as soon as he is allowed to – which is currently expected to be july 4 at the earliest.  meanwhile, toni & guy has 1,000 clients on the waiting list at its branch in sloane square, chelsea; 800 at wimbledon; and even 300 at east grinstead.  mr ward, whose other clients include queen rania of jordan and donald trump’s ex-wife ivana, said: ‘if we were opening this week, people could swallow that. but there’s another five weeks to wait and people are getting desperate.’  he said has been deluged with requests for illicit private appointments in customers’ gardens, but has turned them all down  ‘we’re a high-profile salon and we have to be whiter than white,’ he said. ‘we have told all our staff that it is a disciplinary offence to do any customers during lockdown. no salon should be doing haircuts.’  however, he said two rival london salons have been bending the rules and ‘sneakily offering appointments on the quiet’.  his wife hellen, who runs the business with him, called those who broke guidelines ‘despicable’, adding: ‘we have been begged and begged to do people’s hair, but it’s not a good look when the government has been so fantastic by providing furlough support.’  she also warned people not to colour their hair at home, as it will take too long to fix later. ‘we cannot give you a four-hour appointment to sort your hair out,’ she said.  hellen said that safely reopening the 5,000 sq ft salon, where haircuts cost up to £325, would be a ‘logistical nightmare’.  only half the 45 styling chairs will be used, and staff and clients will wear ppe such as masks and gloves.  toni & guy also plans to reopen its 172 salons with extended opening times, while hairdressers will hold consultations either by phone or online before appointment to speed up the process.  during lockdown, the company has been inundated with people asking for styling tips to look good on webcams.  the hair and barber council, which represents 11,000 of the uk’s 40,000 hairdressers, says many salon owners want to open on june 15, alongside other non-food retailers."
health,"the r number has been guiding government on when to lift lockdown. but the k number will become crucial for fighting a second wave, scientists believe.  the k value helps indicate how many cases of the coronavirus are caused by 'superspreader' events by measuring variation in the spread of disease.  for covid-19, many outbreaks have been blamed on so-called 'super-spreading' events, where 'super-spreader' people have the opportunity to infect dozens others.  around one in ten people who get the virus are labelled 'super-spreaders' because they are highly contagious. the majority of covid-19 cases, around 80 per cent, are caused by this small group.  the r rate is slowly being quashed by unprecedented restrictions on movement and proximity during the lockdown.  but limiting superspreader events - including sports games, concerts, or even gym classes - will become key in further flattening the infection rate and keeping the crisis under control, scientists have said.  limiting superspreader events - including sports games, concerts, or even gym classes - will become key in further flattening the infection rate and keeping the crisis under control, scientists have said. pictured: cheltenham festival  ministers are currently focused on reducing the 'r' to ease the lockdown.  the r rate is how many people one infected person transmits the virus to on average. if it is 3, it means 10 people would pass it on to 30 more, and so on.  governments everywhere want to force the reproduction number down from about 3 (the natural r number if no action was taken) to below one. an r rate above 1 would cause cases to spiral uncontrollably.  the most recent estimates for the uk are that r is between 0.7-1, and sage warned last week the uk was on the brink of surpassing 1.  once life starts returning to some form of normality, scientists say the k number will guide how to control the virus moving forward.  avoid mass gatherings until a vaccine is found, scientists say avoiding mass gatherings until a vaccine is developed or herd immunity emerges is the best way to prevent the spread of covid-19, a study claims. scientists used computer simulations to model what would happen to the trajectory of the pandemic under various scenarios. it assessed how restrictions on home life, returning to school or work and 'other' interactions, such as at restaurants, concerts or bars, impacted the spread. researchers found that with mitigation efforts such as lockdown and quarantine in place, the key to curbing the spread of the disease is to stop 'superspreader' events. academics from the universities of copenhagen and roskilde split human-to-human interactions into three categories and inputted them into computer simulations. if the world was to return to normal, with all restrictions eased, these superspreader events would be a drop in the ocean, making little impact on the spread of the virus. however, when the r rate is being quashed by unprecedented restrictions on movement and proximity, the superspreader events become key in further flattening the infection rate. writing in their study, the researchers write: 'the simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the ""other"" category. 'this in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the ""home"" and ""school/workplace"" setting.' advertisement  the k number tracks the extent to which new outbreaks are caused by a few 'superspreading events', the sunday times reports.  this k measure captures variation in the way a disease is spread. not everyone passes the virus on at the same speed, and not every environment poses a risk to mass transmission.  if the k figure is close to one, as with influenza, a virus will move relatively evenly through the population without variation.  sars-cov-2 is estimated to have a large variation, which means it doesn't follow a simple pattern.  in the case of covid-19, the k is thought to be 0.1 to 0.5 per cent, according to researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine.  their findings suggest the majority of secondary transmission may be caused by a very small fraction of individuals.  in other words, 10 per cent of people are highly infectious, and lead to 80 per cent of transmission. these people may be called 'super spreaders'.  the other 90 per cent of individuals don't actually spread it to many other people. they are responsible for the remaining 20 per cent of covid-19 transmission.  this has huge implications for governments trying to ease restrictions but avoid a second wave of infections, according to adam kucharski, an associate professor at lshtm who was involved with the research.  'it could be that you have a lot of cases that crop up and don't infect anybody and you have one case who goes to a particular environment, or particular workplace, and sparks a very large outbreak,' dr kucharski told the sunday times.  r, which the government is trying to keep below one, was important when covid-19 was at its height. but now 'it's not just the average amount of transmission, it is also the amount of variation', dr kucharksi said.  there have been multiple occasions where one individual case has lead to several other cases - even though the r rate is naturally around 3.  the centre for disease control and prevention reported a large outbreak that was the result of a choir rehearsal in washington state on march 10.  some 61 of the choir’s members attended the rehearsal, and one person had 'cold like' symptoms at the time. they later tested positive for covid-19.  the rehearsal lasted for two-and-a-half hours, with attendees reportedly taking precautions not to mingle too much because they were aware the virus was already in the us.  ultimately, an estimated 87 per cent of attendees later got sick. this includes 32 confirmed cases and 20 probable. two people died.  gyms, business conferences, nightclubs and concerts also lend themselves as the perfect place for the virus to spread, due to the setting and because there are many people for which a superspreader could come into contact with.  cheltenham festival in the uk would have provided perfect conditions for the disease to spread easily, researchers say.  professor tim spector, who is leading the uk's biggest covid-tracking project, said the four-day festival in march led to more coronavirus deaths and suffering.  data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus 'hotspots' shortly after the events, the bbc reported.  the focus of controlling the epidemic, and keeping the r number down, should therefore be to limit events where super-spreaders could wreak havoc.  the lshtm researchers wrote in their paper, published in wellcome open research: 'as most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare super-spreading events.'  dr kucharksi said: 'if a handful of events generate most of your outbreak, then if you can find a way of identifying where and when those events are happening then that reduces far more of your transmission than if you were just trying to follow up every case as if they were the same.  'the difficulty is you have to predict where these ""superspreading events"" happen.'"
health,"advertisement  the uk today announced 215 more covid-19 deaths, taking the official number of coronavirus victims to 38,376 - but it is the lowest saturday total since lockdown began.  culture secretary oliver dowden announced the figure today at downing street's daily press conference, where he also revealed 2,445 more people had tested positive for the virus.  a total of 272,826 britons have now been officially diagnosed with the viral disease, but millions more cases have been missed due to a lack of widespread testing.  today's death figure marks the lowest saturday rise since march 21, three days before the country went into lockdown, when there were just 56 coronavirus fatalities.  it is down significantly from the record high of 1,115 recorded on saturday april 18 during the peak of the crisis. for comparison, there were 282 deaths last saturday.  but despite the continued downward trend, three of the government's coronavirus scientists claim the uk is lifting restrictions too soon.  the reproduction 'r' rate - the average number of people an infected patient passes the virus to - is sitting between 0.7 and 0.9 and if it breaches 1 then the outbreak could spiral back out of control.  ministers are trying to juggle both keeping the r below 1 - to extinguish the spread of infection - and fire up the economy and return to normal life.  the new lockdown rules will allow the public to travel to beauty spots to sunbathe with members of their household, or to meet one person from another household at a two-metre distance from monday.  in other twists and turns in the coronavirus crisis today:  the government warned the british public not to abuse new liberties as covid-19 lockdown is eased , with deputy chief medical officer professor jonathan van tam warning 'we're at a very dangerous moment'  senior tories have demanded boris johnson reduces social distancing or see apocalyptic job losses in hospitality sector  scientists said picnickers must sit in the shape of a hexagon, pentagon or parallelogram two metres apart to stay safe in a social-distanced summer  ex-education secretary alan johnson claimed teaching unions 'got it wrong' over reopening schools and must now back down and stop their 'war dance'  holidaymakers arriving in mallorca and ibiza could face coronavirus tests at the airport and then a six-hour wait in hotels for results  today's deaths include 146 in hospitals in england, 22 in total across scotland 14 in wales and just one in northern ireland. the remaining fatalities occurred in care homes in england and in the wider community.  three experts on the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage), which is steering ministers through the crisis, lined up this morning to caution that measures were being relaxed when the infection rate was still not low enough.  professor peter horby said britain could not afford to lose control of the virus. he told bbc radio 4 this morning: 'we really can't go back to a situation where we've got the numbers of cases and deaths we've had in the past.'  sir jeremy farrar, director of the wellcome trust and sage member, said in a twitter post that he 'agreed with john' on the clear science advice, appearing to reference sage colleague professor john edmunds, who said on friday the government was 'taking risks' by relaxing measures from monday.  sir jeremy also said the newly-introduced nhs test and trace system needed to be 'fully working' before measures were eased. he wrote: 'covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in england. agree with john & clear science advice.  'tti (test, trace and isolate) has to be in place, fully working, capable dealing any surge immediately, locally responsive, rapid results & infection rates have to be lower. and trusted.'  professor edmunds, an epidemiologist at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said the prime minister had 'clearly made a political decision' by unlocking the country on monday, because the threat of a second peak remains high.  he claimed that, even if the 'untested' contact tracing scheme goes smoothly, the country could still suffer 80 deaths a day until a vaccine is developed.  professor edmunds said: 'many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that then means we have fewer cases occurring before we relax the measures.  the lockdown rules are increasingly varied across the uk as the home nations butt heads on easing restrictions  professor john edmunds, an adviser to sage, said he would have preferred to see infections driven down further before relaxing the lockdown  'if we had incidence at a lower level then, even if r went up a little bit, we wouldn't be in a position where we're overwhelming the health service rapidly.  'we could tolerate a little bit [of an increase in infections]. at the moment, with relatively high incidence,relaxing the measures and also with an untested track and trace system, i think we are taking some risk here.  'even if that risk does pay off, and we manage to keep the incidence flat, we're keeping it flat at quite a high level - 8,000 new infections a day.  'if there's a 1 per cent infection fatality rate that's 80 deaths per day, if there's half a per cent, that's 40 per day.  'that's the amount of deaths we might expect to see going forward. that's clearly a political decision, it's not a scientific decision.  'it's pretty clear to me the direction of travel is we're starting to relax and we're going to keep the reproduction level at one, but that means we're keeping the incidence at this level.'  under the easing in england, different households will be able to see family and friends in groups of six from monday, although social distancing measures will still have to be followed.  they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned. mr johnson said that meant barbecues are possible.  schools will start to reopen from monday, and non-essential shops will follow from june 15.  professor edmunds said that without a vaccine or viable treatment at the ready, the government cannot ease restrictions much more than it already has.  he added: 'the issue is clearly there's a need to get the economy restarted and get people back to their jobs.  'and clearly there's a social and mental health need to allow people to meet with friends and family and so on.  'a targeted approach is good, it's not putting everybody in lockdown which of course allows the economy and for us to go back to some level of normality.  'but none of us think - that have looked at this in any great detail - that [the track and trace scheme] will be sufficient to be able to hold the reproduction number below one.  'we will still have to have significant numbers of wider social distancing measures in place."
health,"is the cliche true – are men reluctant to talk to doctors about their health? surveys paint a depressing picture: up to 80 per cent of men questioned by bupa recently said they would rather endure an illness than seek help.  in my own surgery, men under the age of 40 are an unusual sight. although we do get more middle-aged blokes coming in, often to have a heart health check-up, i'd say two-thirds of my patients, generally, are women. there are many reasons for this.  women are more used to seeing doctors, having often gone through the process of having a baby, with all the check-ups and visits that involves before, during and for years after. regular screening for cervical cancer, from their mid-20s, and breast cancer in middle age, is another reason.  and, no doubt, some men feel pressure to 'be a man' and not talk about their problems. nowhere is this more apparent than with 'embarrassing' ailments.  up to 80 per cent of men questioned by bupa recently said they would rather endure an illness than seek help  'physical stuff around genitals is something most guys will find difficult to talk about,' says jim pollard from the men's health forum. 'these things are tied up with notions of masculinity – and men don't like sitting in a doctor's surgery admitting they don't know what's wrong.'  the key thing to remember, as dr kaye has already pointed out on the previous pages about women's health, is that we gps have seen all of this before.  men can, and do, come and see me all the time with these things – and, of course, if you'd rather speak to a male doctor, we understand that.  in the meantime, here is my guide for dealing with the male ailments you might be shy to talk about – but really needn't be.  the question men most ask google but not me  suicide risk among men who won't talk men are significantly more likely to commit suicide than women because they struggle to admit they need help. for many men, mental health issues remain a taboo subject, despite efforts to bring problems such as anxiety and depression out into the open. men's health forum founder jim pollard says: 'i think it's embarrassing for men to say, 'i don't think i'm coping.' mental health charities, such as heads together, founded in 2016 by the duke and duchess of cambridge, pictured, and prince harry, have been encouraging men to speak out 'one guy told me he'd rather admit to not being able to get it up than admit he was struggling mentally.' in recent years, mental health charities, such as heads together, founded in 2016 by the duke and duchess of cambridge and prince harry, have been encouraging men to speak out. despite this, three-quarters of suicides are by men. almost 5,000 killed themselves in 2018 compared with 1,604 women. according to the samaritans, the highest rate of suicide is in men aged 45 to 49, and is the biggest killer in men under 35. 'women are more likely to seek treatment,' jim says. 'we've run confidential and anonymous chat services for men's mental and physical health issues, and in both cases the doctors said they got talking about issues that never came out in normal surgeries.' a samaritans spokesman added: 'suicide is rarely caused by one thing. there is a range of psychological, social, cultural and economic factors that influence suicide risk.' for support, call the samaritans' free 24-hour helpline on 116 123. advertisement  it is, according to search-engine data, one of the most frequently asked questions relating to male sexual health: what are the spots on my penis?  sexually transmitted infections are common, but also easily sorted. however, i often see a patient who's worried himself unnecessarily – or worse, tried to self-treat – when the problem is entirely benign.  what causes it?  small raised bumps along the shaft of the penis that are pale red, yellow-white or skin-coloured are usually what we call fordyce spots or granules.  they can also appear on the scrotum, and the lips, but they are totally harmless oil-secreting glands in the skin, and there is no reason to do anything about them. there are loads of home-remedies for sale on the internet, but these at best do nothing and at worst damage the skin. avoid them.  small white spots around the head of the penis, known as pearly papules, are also totally harmless and about a third of men have them. it's also not unusual to get small red pimples, known as septic spots, which just go away after a week.  genital warts are common – about 57,000 men get them each year. the colour depends on your skin shade but the characteristic appearance is of a 'wobbly' projection – like a tiny strand of seaweed.  they are caused by the human papillomavirus, or hpv, which is also linked with cervical, throat and anal cancers.  genital warts are highly infectious and can be passed on through sex, but cases have been in decline thanks to the rollout of a vaccine against the virus offered to teenage girls (and, since september, also to boys).  spots which are more like ulcers – but are usually painless – may be syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection (sti) which can also cause a rash on the hands and feet.  i know dr google may have diagnosed penile cancer, which is linked to the hpv virus, but this affects only 640 men a year in the uk.  what can i do?  if you want to save yourself the worry, just see a doctor and get a proper diagnosis.  your gp, or a local sexual health clinic, will be able to test you for stis and prescribe treatment – antibiotics for syphilis and a cream or minor surgery to burn, laser or freeze off genital warts. and if you are treated, and symptoms persist, make sure you go back to the doctor.  mystifying scar tissue causing sex problems  bodies come in a variety of shapes and sizes – and penises are no different.  most men will worry at some point that their own isn't 'normal', but it's time to take note if there's an obvious change – a more noticeable bend, for example, or even an hour-glass shape.  this could be a sign of the usually harmless condition peyronie's disease. normally only noticeable when erect, if any of these are accompanied by painful erections or erectile dysfunction then it should be checked out.  what causes it?  experts are still a bit stumped, but the change of shape is the result of scar tissue, or plaques, developing within the shaft. in some cases it happens following an injury sustained during sexual activity.  it's also relatively common, affecting up to one in ten men, and is most prevalent in those aged 50 and over. it might also run in families.  while not harmful, it can be emotionally distressing, particularly if it affects sexual relationships, which can take a huge toll on mental health.  what can i do?  it can improve all by itself. but take advice from a gp or sexual health clinic. there are some potential treatments, including injecting steroids or using ultrasound therapy, but there is only limited evidence this works.  a change in penis shape is the result of scar tissue and while not harmful, it can be emotionally distressing, particularly if it affects sexual relationships  if the change in shape is severe and makes intercourse impossible, for instance, surgery to cut away the plaque or implant a device to straighten the penis is available as a very last resort.  consultant urologist asif muneer tells me some patients find it easier to take pictures of the problem to save embarrassment when they seek help. 'when i started, people were bringing in out-of-focus polaroids,' he said. 'now, thanks to mobile phone cameras, i can get a better idea of the problem.'  when the location of a lump is everything  a lump in the testicles doesn't always mean cancer, despite what dr google might suggest.  for every 100 men who find such a growth, 96 will discover it has a completely harmless cause. and often it might not even need any treatment at all.  any change should be checked out straight away by a doctor, but there are a whole range of benign conditions that it's more likely to be than cancer.  what causes it?  any lump behind or on top of the testicle might be an epididymal cyst – a harmless growth filled with liquid.  it's more common in the over-40s and rarely needs treatment.  this is diagnosed by a doctor shining a special light through the scrotum. if it's an epididymal cyst, the light will shine through the liquid, if it is cancer, it won't.  other common lumps include varicoceles, distended veins just like varicose veins in legs, and hydroceles, which involve fluid accumulating around the testicle.  an infection known as epididymo-orchitis, which causes the testicles to become painful and swollen, is the only issue that may need treatment with antibiotics.  but robert cornes, a specialist nurse at male cancer charity orchid, says that as a general rule of thumb, any small, hard lump attached to the testicle should be checked in case it's an early sign of testicular cancer.  what can i do?  while most lumps will be completely benign, do see a gp, urges mr cornes.  'a quick examination will tell us what's going on and, if not, an ultrasound on the testicle will be about 99 per cent accurate.'  it's worth remembering, too, that testicular cancer is one of the most treatable cancers if caught early, with ten-year survival rates at 98 per cent.  what causes these moobs to grow?  it's the last thing men want to talk about. but weight gain around the chest area – sometimes described as 'man boobs' or 'moobs' – affects as many as 70 per cent of men over the age of 50.  weight gain around the chest area - sometimes described as 'man boobs' or 'moobs' - affects as many as 70 per cent of men over the age of 50  what could it be?  the clinical name is gynaecomastia and it's generally harmless. but it can be uncomfortable, causing chafing and tenderness, and lead to feelings of depression and isolation. it generally develops because of a hormone imbalance between testosterone and oestrogen. when men pile on the pounds later in life, the extra body fat leads to a rise in oestrogen.  testosterone levels, which normally keep oestrogen in check, also drop with age. both can cause breast tissue to develop. in rarer cases it might be a symptom of liver cirrhosis, testicular cancer, kidney failure or an overactive thyroid, or a side effect of medication for an enlarged prostate or anti-psychotic drugs.  what can i do?  most men won't need to seek treatment. losing weight can help. in some cases, usually in men who are otherwise slim, drugs can help suppress excess oestrogen.  struggling to perform? get a diabetes check all men will occasionally fail to either get or maintain an erection. it doesn’t mean there’s a serious or permanent problem. studies have shown that about 4.3 million men in the uk – one in five – suffer regularly from erectile dysfunction, and it’s thought to affect half of all men over 50. most men avoid talking to their gp – or their partner – about it. and yet it’s potentially really easy to solve. what causes it? stress, tiredness, anxiety or drinking too much alcohol are the most common causes of an intermittent problem. but an erection also relies on having a healthy circulation, so in some cases it might be an early sign of more serious – but treatable – conditions such as heart problems or diabetes. men with diabetes are three times more likely to have erection problems, and it’s really common for patients to come to clinics seeking help with impotence only to find they’ve got diabetes. what can i do? erection problems can be treated easily with drugs such as viagra, which increases blood flow to the penis. it’s available to buy over the counter in pharmacies, but the pharmacist will want to have a proper discussion about your health history first. for example, men who have previously had a stroke or heart attack shouldn’t take viagra. those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may be advised to lose weight or take medication to lower blood sugar levels, and if there’s any sign of cardiovascular disease a statin might be offered to reduce cholesterol. this in itself can help. you might be tested for your testosterone level too. just don’t be tempted to buy viagra online – £17 million worth of unlicensed or counterfeit viagra was seized in 2016 alone. at best, they won’t do anything, but at worst they could be dangerous. ‘go and see your gp – don’t self-diagnose – and get your overall health checked,’ says jim pollard from the men’s health forum.  night time toilet trips could be a warning  stumbling to the toilet in the middle of the night is nothing unusual, especially after a couple of pints at the pub.  it's often linked to advancing years and will, most likely, worsen with age.  but if it's regularly happening several times a night, the need becomes more urgent, and if it's affecting the quality of sleep, then it might be worth going to see a gp.  what could it be?  there is a good chance it's nothing more than an enlarged prostate – the walnut-sized gland underneath the bladder which produces semen.  according to health regulatory body nice, 40 per cent of men in their 50s – rising to 90 per cent in their 80s – have the condition.  it is a completely normal side effect of ageing.  however, it puts additional pressure on the bladder, which causes men to feel the need to urinate more frequently.  men might worry that this means they're at an increased risk of prostate cancer, but this isn't true.  what is important is that the symptoms are checked to rule out prostate cancer, which affects one in eight men.  what can i do?  orchid nurse robert cornes says: 'your gp should refer you to a consultant urologist.'  this appointment may require a rectal examination, and a blood test known as a psa test which, although unreliable, can suggest whether cancer is more likely.  treatment for an enlarged prostate can include simple lifestyle changes, such as drinking less alcohol and caffeine, and exercising more.  medication can reduce the size of the prostate and relax the bladder, but in more serious cases – where drugs fail – surgery may be recommended.  even if the prostate is cancerous it might not need aggressive treatment as generally the tumours grow slowly.  the intimate infection you shouldn't ignore  discharge from the penis, outside of sexual activity, is never normal. if you notice this, it's probably the sign of an infection. the good news is such infections are very easy to treat, so don't delay in seeing a doctor.  what causes it?  white discharge indicates chlamydia, the most commonly diagnosed sti in the uk. it is passed on through unprotected sex, and mainly affects young people aged 15 to 24, but growing numbers of middle-aged men are being struck with it. it may be accompanied by pain when urinating or painful testicles.  green discharge is a sign of gonorrhoea. it also causes inflammation of the foreskin and a burning sensation when urinating.  what can i do?  both conditions are treated with antibiotics. visit your local sexual health clinic to see a clinician and pick up a prescription. alternatively, seek help from an online nhs sexual health clinic. they may offer you the option of a self-swab, which you can do at home and send off, as well as treatment remotely.  in the meantime, to avoid passing it on, don't have unprotected sex as these infections can seriously affect a woman's fertility."
health,"how do the newly eased lockdown rules apply to people who are vulnerable and shielding?  while restrictions continue to be loosened for the majority, people with health problems are currently being advised to continue shielding – adhering to the strictest stay-at-home measures.  parents caring for children or other vulnerable family members who need to shield will also have to stick to stringent social distancing.  shielding groups include organ transplant recipients, people with severe lung conditions, those on certain cancer treatments and pregnant women suffering from significant heart disease.  it used to include those over 70 regardless of medical condition, however that advice has now been withdrawn. current official advice is that those who are shielding should continue to do so until june 30th, but the government has recognised that this is ‘extremely difficult’ and have said the situation will remain under review.  parents caring for children or other vulnerable family members who need to shield will have to stick to stringent social distancing. pictured: an elderly woman in a protective mask  if one of the new tracers tells me i’ve been in close contact with someone with coronavirus, does my whole household have to self-isolate?  now, if someone tests positive for covid-19, they are asked to hand over details of everyone they’ve been in close contact with.  these people – or if under 18 their parent or guardian – will then be contacted by the new track and trace service and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.  only if they develop symptoms during this time will other members of their household have to isolate with them. they should book a test via 111.nhs.uk and the track and trace team will ask for all their contacts, kick-starting the cycle for them, and those they’ve been in contact with.  am i allowed to drive to another area of the country, and stay overnight?  no. cabinet office guidance states that ‘leaving your home – the place you live – to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed and this includes visiting second homes’.  you can drive as far as you want to do your daily exercise, or on a day trip to an outdoor open space. however, the guidance says you should still try to stay local.  roads such as the m3 near eastleigh, hampshire, pictured were busy today with people making day trips to outdoor open spaces, but the rules do not allow staying at another home overnight  has the much-discussed ‘r’ number increased since lockdown has been eased?  last week the government revealed that the ‘r’ number – the rate at which the coronavirus is spreading – had been stable between 0.7 and one. this was key in the decision to release us from lockdown.  keeping the figure below one is vital for avoiding a second peak. there are regional differences in r, and it may fluctuate, say some experts.  but as long as the average figure remains below one, the government remains on target.  what is the risk of a second wave?  at the moment, it’s impossible to say for sure.  some disease outbreaks – including the spanish flu pandemic more than a century ago and, more recently, swine flu – did have second waves. but others such as sars and mers have not.  finding a vaccine that can effectively protect against covid-19 is a sure-fire way to prevent a second wave. but in the meantime, the r number – the number of people infected by someone with the virus – needs to stay below one to stop one happening.  good adherence to social-distancing rules and asking people with the virus and those they have come into contact with to self-isolate will help with this aim.  some disease outbreaks – including the spanish flu pandemic more than a century ago, pictured, and, more recently, swine flu – did have second waves. but others such as sars and mers have not  am i more likely to die in a car accident or from flu, than from coronavirus?  it is almost impossible to make an accurate, direct risk comparison as this virus has only be around for less than a year.  the unusually restrictive steps we’ve taken to stop the virus makes it an unfair comparison.  however, when it comes to children the answer is almost certainly – yes.  there is now a consensus that children are far less likely to both catch the virus and become unwell from it. only a handful of uk victims have been children.  sir david spiegelhalter at the university of cambridge says: ‘there have been, based on the data so far, extremely low risks to children. only four deaths in children under 15 have been linked to covid.’  in comparison, about 170 children die every year due to car accidents.  the risk of death from covid-19 for the over-60s could be as high as three in 100. flu, comparatively, kills roughly one in 1,000, and the annual risk of death by road accident is one in 20,000."
health,"it sounds bizarre, but the length of time you are able to stand on one leg is a powerful predictor of how long you will live and how healthy you will be.  when i mentioned this in a column last year, many of you wrote in to say how you had done – and you also submitted a fair few questions.  if you improved your balance, would you live longer? was it normal to be better on one leg than the other? and – one of my favourites – why was it easier when you listened to music?  the answers to these are: possibly, yes, and i have no idea (but many people find music helps them concentrate, and listening is known to switch on and off all sorts of areas of the brain depending on how much we like it, which might be a factor).  dr michael mosley, pictured, demonstrates the ways you can test how well you are ageing  if you missed that column, you can learn how to do the standing on one leg test by reading the panel below.  you also wanted to know if there were other ways to test how well you are ageing. the answer to that is, yes. here are a few.  simple chair test that could give you a boost into old age  for this test you have to sit in a chair without arms and see how many times you can go from sitting to standing in a minute. researchers, who started their study in 1999, found that participants who managed to do it more than 36 times were twice as likely to still be alive 13 years later compared with those who could manage to do only 23.  get a grip to measure your fitness – and your brain power  ...and don't forget the one leg test the claim that a good measure of future health is how long you can stand on one leg with your eyes closed is based on a big study carried out by the medical research council. back in 1999, researchers did three simple tests on 2,760 men and women in their 50s. they measured grip, counted how often they could stand upright from sitting in a minute, and timed how long the volunteers could stand on one leg with eyes closed. dr michael demonstrates the one leg test when they revisited the people 13 years later, they found performance in all three tests was a predictor of how likely it was a person would die from cancer or a heart attack. but the one-legged standing test came out top. those who stood for two seconds or less on the earlier test were three times more likely to have died over the next 13 years than those who managed ten seconds or more. so… get a friend with a stopwatch. put hands on hips, stand on one leg and close your eyes. stop timing as soon as you begin to lose balance. take an average of three attempts. in your 40s you should do 13 seconds. in your 50s you’ll do well to get over eight seconds. at 60-plus, you will probably manage about four seconds. advertisement  hand strength is another surprisingly good predictor of future health, largely because it is a marvellous measure of your overall fitness. more surprisingly, it is also linked to how well your brain is working.  in a recent study of nearly half a million people aged between 40 and 69, researchers from manchester university found that those who had the best hand-grip strength also did better across a wide range of brain tests. these included reaction time, logical problem-solving ability and lots of different tests of memory.  i was delighted to read this as i have recently measured my own hand-grip strength and discovered it is surprisingly good for my age.  the only accurate way to measure your grip strength is with a handgrip dynamometer – a gadget designed specifically for this job. they are funny-looking things, sort of a cross between a high-tech vegetable-peeler and a calculator. they can be bought online for about £30.  to use it, squeeze the dynamometer as hard as you can with one hand for about five seconds. then do it with the other hand and take an average of the reading on the digital display. it gives a reading in kilograms – measuring the force of your squeeze.  men tend to be stronger than women, though that obviously does not make them any brighter.  i have a grip strength of 55kg, which is excellent for someone in their 60s (i'm 63). a normal reading for a man of my age would be between 31kg and 48kg, and a poor result would be less than 29kg. for a woman in her 60s, a strong result would be more than 28kg, while less than 16kg would be considered poor.  there are detailed tables showing average results for every age available online – search for hand-grip strength norms.  press-ups are also a good measure of your upper-body strength and of heart health.  in a study carried out by researchers from the harvard school of public health, 1,000 firemen in their early 40s were asked to do as many press-ups as they could in a minute. when the same men were seen ten years later, it turned out those who had managed to do 40 or more press-ups in the earlier test were 96 per cent less likely to have had a heart attack than those who managed ten or fewer.  unfortunately, they didn't do this test with women, but broadly speaking you would expect a woman to be able to do half as many press-ups, for her age, as a man.  a man in his 50s should be able to do 20, a woman at least ten.  i can do 40, though i huff and puff towards the end.  why a low resting heart rate is vital  heart rate at rest is another good measure of overall health.  measure yours by turning your right hand so your palm is facing you, then use a couple of fingers from your other hand to measure your pulse at your wrist, on the side your thumb is on, just below where your wrist joins your hand. count the number of beats in 15 seconds and multiply by four to calculate your resting heart rate.  a study in sweden, where they followed 798 men for 21 years, found those who had a resting heart rate of more than 75 beats per minute at the start of the study were twice as likely to have died than those who had a rate of fewer than 60 beats per minute.  heart rate at rest is a good test of overall health and can be measured by turning your hand so your palm is facing you, then using a couple of fingers from your other hand, pictured, counting the number of beats in 15 seconds and multiplying by four  people whose heart rates got faster as they aged were more likely to have a heart attack, possibly because they were becoming fatter and less fit.  an increase in resting heart rate of just ten beats per minute meant an increased risk of death of 30 per cent.  my resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute – roughly what it was ten years ago.  the tests i've just described are all different measures of fitness, and you can improve all of your results with a bit of work.  to bring down your resting heart rate, do more aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling or running.  you can improve your hand-grip strength by squeezing tennis balls, or by doing more resistance exercises, such as press-ups.  as for balance, you could take up t'ai chi or yoga. there are plenty of classes available online.  i practise balancing while i am brushing my teeth, at least 30 seconds on each leg. but do it with your eyes open, or you risk falling over and knocking out your teeth!"
health,"we doctors are a fairly unshockable bunch. we've seen it all – multiple times, usually, and probably that same day. people talk of embarrassing ailments – often, but not exclusively, ones that involve our 'private' body parts or bodily functions. but it really is all in a day's work for us.  of course, i understand why some patients find these topics hard to talk about. but the big concern is when it stops them seeking any kind of medical help. surveys suggest that up to two-thirds of britons avoid visiting their gp for conditions they consider embarrassing. many instead ignore their problems, hoping they'll go away, but often they are unwittingly delaying diagnosis and treatment until things have worsened considerably.  bowel and cervical cancer, for example, are frequently detected too late because many people don't attend screening or see a doctor when they get worrying symptoms.  many patients find it difficult to talk about embarrassing ailments, but doctors are an unshockable bunch  thankfully, most of the time it's nothing that can't be easily treated and, really, the worst part is knowing people have suffered in silence for so long. i often hear the phrase 'i thought i was the only one…' when it couldn't be further from the truth. most of these problems affect millions every year.  so in an effort to finally banish any awkwardness, over the next two weeks we will guide readers through some of the most common intimate problems, explaining the symptoms, causes and treatments. this week, i focus on conditions affecting women, while my gp colleague and mail on sunday columnist dr ellie cannon tackles those that men most commonly suffer from.  alongside our own in-depth knowledge, we've spoken to leading specialists for the very best advice. we hope it will help dispel the myths, arm you with the facts and give you the courage to pick up the phone and make that appointment with your gp.  the itch that many women just put up with... for years  persistent itching – medically termed pruritus – anywhere on the body is uncomfortable. but when it affects an already sensitive area such as the vagina or vulva (the vaginal opening, labia and clitoris), it is particularly distressing.  about one woman in ten in the uk suffers long-term genital itching and, aside from the burning and irritation, it may also cause the skin to break, leading to bleeding and skin infections.  sex can be so painful that some women avoid it altogether.  while it can affect any woman at any age, the dryness that causes the itching is more common in later life. i find it hugely frustrating when patients say they have put up with it for years, too embarrassed to seek help, or didn't realise there was anything that could be done.  what causes it?  usually an itch is linked to dryness, says paula briggs, consultant in sexual and reproductive health at southport and ormskirk hospital nhs trust.  this is common around the time of the menopause, due to the lack of the hormone oestrogen which keeps the delicate membranes of the vagina and vulva supple.  but breastfeeding, use of the contraceptive pill, breast cancer drugs and other medications can trigger it too.  'no one talks about dryness – it's a massive taboo subject,' says dr briggs. indeed, a 2013 survey of british women found one in ten sought no treatment out of embarrassment, and 42 per cent 'didn't think it was important'. dryness can also be due to a common skin condition called lichen sclerosus, where white, itchy patches form on the vulva. but left untreated, this can cause scarring.  breastfeeding is one of many things that can trigger persistent itching – medically termed pruritus  the cause is not known but scientists believe it may be due to a fault in the immune system leading to attacks on the skin.  on very rare occasions, an itch can be a sign of vulval cancer.  what can i do?  dr briggs says: 'dryness will go on for ever if it's not treated. it's a chronic, progressive condition, not like most menopausal symptoms, which will resolve.'  thankfully, creams or pessaries containing oestrogen can improve the quality of the skin and reduce the itch, as can prescription drugs such as ospemifene. 'the longer the gap without oestrogen, the longer it takes to reverse symptoms,' warns dr briggs.  vaginal moisturisers are useful too, but stick to brands such as sylk and yes as they do not contain perfumes or additives found in soaps, bubble bath or talcum powders that irritate sensitive skin.  for lichen sclerosus, steroid creams can reduce the inflammation causing the discomfort in about 95 per cent of cases.  but your gp should also refer you to a gynaecologist or dermatologist to rule out skin cancer, as the symptoms are similar.  why you shouldn't ignore extreme pms  it's a familiar feeling for millions of women – sudden, inexplicable despair that strikes around the same time every month. about 90 per cent of women suffer premenstrual syndrome mood changes or anxiety, and most manage symptoms with painkillers or lifestyle tweaks.  but for the estimated five to eight per cent with the most extreme form of the condition – called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd) – the symptoms can be utterly debilitating, with many experiencing suicidal thoughts and self-managing with alcohol.  many women suffer occasional discomfort during sex, but persistent pain or bleeding afterwards should always be checked out  what causes it?  again, a drop in the sex hormone oestrogen, coupled with the rise in levels of the hormone progesterone before a period.  this triggers a decline in levels of serotonin – a chemical neurotransmitter which helps to regulate mood.  research shows a minority of women are extremely sensitive to these hormonal fluctuations, probably due to genetic susceptibility.  what can i do?  getting the right diagnosis is key, yet pmdd is poorly understood by many doctors.  if you believe you suffer with it, visit a helpful website – such as the one run by charity mind – and print off some of its pmdd information pages. show them to your gp to help them understand your symptoms.  one effective treatment, according to dr briggs, is suppressing ovulation, using the combined contraceptive pill. this controls fluctuating hormones. other women may need antidepressants such as fluoxetine or sertraline, but only for the last two weeks of each menstrual cycle rather than every day.  a trial of a drug called sepranolone, which inhibits chemicals in the brain involved with pmdd, found it reduced symptoms by 80 per cent in a group of 120 women. now a larger trial, involving 250 women, has started.  over 40 and 'leaking'? it's more common than hay fever incontinence, or 'leakage', affects nearly half of all mothers, and in women over the age of 40 is more common than hay fever. and although it's often linked to advancing years, it happens in younger women too. there are two types – stress and urge incontinence – though some people suffer both at the same time. stress incontinence is triggered by coughing, sneezing or exercise, whereas urge incontinence usually happens without an obvious trigger. incontinence affects nearly half of all mothers what causes it? stress incontinence stems from weakness in the pelvic-floor muscles, usually from pregnancy, being overweight or chronic coughing. laughing, coughing or exercise puts extra strain on these muscles, causing urine to leak. it's also more common after the menopause, as the lack of oestrogen in the body further weakens these muscles. urge incontinence is related to an overactive bladder – the muscles contract unexpectedly, so you feel a sudden sense of needing to go. what can i do? 'women can buy tena lady pads in the supermarket, but that's just surviving with the problem and not dealing with it,' says gynaecological cancer nurse tracie miles, from the eve appeal charity, who has suffered with the problem herself. seeing your gp is the first step. different kinds of incontinence require different treatments.' simple exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor can tackle stress incontinence, such as tensing the muscles several times each day for ten seconds, squeezing as if to stop yourself urinating. severe cases may need surgery to correct any prolapse. urge incontinence responds well to medication but a type of training called a 'bladder drill' is also effective, which involves gradually increasing the amount of time between urinating. advertisement  when painful sex can be a sign of cancer  many women suffer occasional discomfort during sex, but persistent pain or bleeding afterwards should always be checked out.  vaginal pain, or dyspareunia, is divided into two categories. either it is 'superficial' and felt in the vagina and vulva, or it is 'deep dyspareunia', which is felt in the pelvis or abdomen.  after the menopause, superficial discomfort during sex is incredibly common, as reduced levels of oestrogen and progesterone make the sensitive tissues dry and sore. in roughly two-thirds of older women, this can result in a small amount of blood after sex – which is usually nothing to worry about.  what causes it?  common causes of bleeding after sex include a benign growth in the cervix, called a polyp, as well as side effects of the contraceptive pill. sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea – which are increasingly common in women over 50 – can also cause bleeding.  in worst-case scenarios, bleeding after sex could be an indication of cell changes in the cervix, which may signal cervical cancer. on average, nine new cervical-cancer cases are diagnosed every day in the uk – more than 3,200 a year – and the average age of diagnosis is 50. but treatment is very effective if it is caught early.  sometimes painful sex is due to vaginismus – involuntarily tightening of the vaginal muscles when penetration is attempted.  if the deep pain exists without bleeding, it could be endometriosis – a common condition in which womb tissue grows outside the womb, or non-cancerous growths called fibroids. most worryingly, it could signal ovarian cancer.  what can i do?  your gp can take swabs from inside the vagina, or a urine test, to rule out sexually transmitted infections. a smear would also be used to check for changes which could lead to cervical cancer.  depending on the results, this may be followed up with an internal ultrasound, in which a small probe is inserted into the vagina.  a blood test may be carried out to check for signs of ovarian cancer. it measures levels of a protein called ca125, which may be present if there is a tumour.  if the pain is superficial, the gp can prescribe hormone creams, emollients and lubricants.  and if the problem is vaginismus, the tight muscles can be retrained with vaginal dilators or you may be referred to a psychosexual counsellor to ease physical tension.  feminine washes can do more harm than good  millions of women miss out on cancer cure one in four women skip their routine smear tests, meaning thousands develop cervical cancer each year when it could have been prevented. the test, which involves taking a swab from the cervix (the neck of the womb), looks for signs of the human papillomavirus (hpv), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. if detected, doctors carry out further tests to check for any abnormal changes to cells, which could indicate early signs of cancer. treatment is given early, which in the majority of cases cures the disease. but uptake of these vital tests is now at its lowest rate in two decades, with four million women missing out on at least one test. there are multiple reasons for this, including embarrassment, but also disabilities and a history of sexual trauma. also, a small number of women have a condition that affects the position of their cervix, which makes undergoing the procedure uncomfortable. but for the majority of women, smear tests – which should be arranged every three years for 25-49-year-olds and every five years for 50-65-year-olds – are painless. imogen pinnell, from the charity jo's cervical cancer trust, said: 'we know that smear tests can be embarrassing or nerve-racking. but, ultimately, they can prevent 75 per cent of cervical cancers from even beginning. 'it is important to talk about barriers to screening, which support can often be offered for.'  we all know about 'friendly' gut bacteria by now, but a wide range of bacteria live all over our skin, including inside the vagina, forming a balanced ecosystem.  this bacterial cocktail can cause a slight, subtle smell, which changes throughout the menstrual cycle. lots of women think this is a sign of poor hygiene, a myth perpetuated by marketing companies to sell dubious and potentially harmful washes and deodorants.  the vagina is, in fact, one of the cleanest organs in the body – as its healthy bacteria kill nasty ones.  a slight smell is normal, but it may get stronger at certain times in the menstrual cycle. if it becomes especially pungent (often described as fishy, with a watery discharge), it could be a common problem called bacterial vaginosis.  what causes it?  bacterial vaginosis, which affects one in three women, develops when the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina becomes disturbed, causing a growth in an organism called gardnerella.  unlike thrush, a fungal infection often triggered by sex or a weakened immune system, bacterial vaginosis usually comes from over-cleaning or using scented products. such products alter the delicate ph balance of the vagina – a measure of how acidic it is – which can then disrupt its bacterial 'formula'.  unlike normal discharge – a thick mucus that keeps the vagina clean and moist – bacterial vaginosis makes it very runny and clear, although some women won't notice a change in texture at all.  what can i do?  treatment usually involves prescribed antibiotic tablets, gels or creams which restore the bacterial balance within a week.  further problems are rare but gynaecologists warn that there's a risk of early delivery if you're pregnant and leave it untreated.  as for thrush, over-the-counter anti-fungal creams, tablets and pessaries clear it up quickly.  there is hope after hair loss  about half of women over 65 have inherited pattern baldness, otherwise known as androgenetic alopecia. but it can also be triggered by a drop in oestrogen levels after the menopause, which damages the hair follicles. tory mp nadine dorries said that her gradual hair loss after the menopause made her 'cry every morning'.  what causes it?  aside from the menopause, it could be deficiencies in nutrients, such as zinc and iron, or even thyroid problems. and roughly two per cent of the population has alopecia areata, where the hair follicles are damaged by a malfunctioning immune system, causing patches of hair loss or total baldness.  about half of women over 65 have inherited pattern baldness, but hair loss can also be triggered by a drop in oestrogen levels after the menopause  what can i do?  firstly, blood tests by a gp can spot any underlying hormonal, thyroid or vitamin deficiencies.  if it's an iron deficiency, for example, it can be treated with supplements, while thyroid problems respond well to treatment with the hormone thyroxine.  other treatments include steroid creams, steroid scalp injections and a lotion, or foam, called minoxidil. but these are not usually available on the nhs and must be accessed privately.  look out for changes to your 'normal'  most women have some vaginal discharge, which is typically clearer and more watery before ovulation but thicker and stickier in the second half of the menstrual cycle. but when it becomes uncharacteristically thick, frothy or is green in colour, it could be a problem.  what causes it?  it could be a yeast infection, such as thrush, but other causes include trichomoniasis, a bacterial infection that makes discharge green and watery, failure to remove a tampon or sexually transmitted gonorrhoea (which generates a thick yellow discharge).  when coupled with other symptoms, such as blood traces or pains, it could be signs of cervical or endometrial cancer.  what can i do?  antibiotics or antifungal medication should take care of thrush, bacterial infections or a sexually transmitted infection.  thrush treatment is available over the counter, while the others need a prescription from a gp.  but remember, most discharge is completely harmless and normal. you should be concerned only if it's a significant change in what is usual for you."
health,"patients ravaged by advanced bowel cancer have been thrown a lifeline – thanks to a breakthrough drug hailed by experts as a game-changer in the fight against the disease.  a landmark trial found immunotherapy treatment pembrolizumab, which helps the body attack and kill cancer cells, doubled the length of time it took for the disease to worsen, compared to standard chemotherapy treatment.  incredibly, more than one in ten patients with a specific sub-type of bowel cancer saw their cancer disappear altogether, according to data presented at the american society of clinical oncology (asco) annual meeting this weekend.  and years after finishing treatment, some are still free of disease.  a graphic, pictured, shows how pembrolizumab helps the body attack and kill cancer cells  the lead author of the keynote-177 trial, thierry andre, of the sorbonne universite and hopital saint antoine in paris, said there was a genuine hope that some patients, who would have been deemed terminal, would now be cured.  diane reynolds, 72, from peterborough, is one of those to benefit from the new drug. after a few weeks of treatment, her tumours, which had spread across her abdomen, had shrunk by half. and within six months they had disappeared entirely.  'i thought they must have made a mistake with the initial diagnosis – i couldn't have had cancer,' she says.  'you can't have cancer and have three rounds of immunotherapy and find it's gone. fortunately, that was true.'  every year there are about 42,000 new cases of bowel cancer in the uk, and 16,000 deaths.  but not all bowel cancers are the same. approximately 15 per cent of patients diagnosed have specific genetic mutations known as microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficiency.  these dna mutations, which can be inherited but sometimes occur randomly, mean cells cannot repair themselves correctly if they are damaged.  over time, this can lead to the development of cancer. if treated early, this group of patients do well. but at later stages they are less likely to respond to chemotherapy and have a reduced chance of survival.  it is estimated that five per cent of patients with advanced bowel cancer have these specific mutations. but researchers hope that, thanks to immunotherapy drugs such as pembrolizumab, this may now be about to change.  diane reynolds, 72, from peterborough, pictured, is one of those to benefit from the new drug  'some patients on the trial have had a complete response to this therapy, are very well and have now been in remission for more than three years,' says dr kai-keen shiu, the trial's uk chief investigator. 'the results should now revolutionise the way we treat these types of bowel cancer patients.'  also known as keytruda, pembrolizumab acts as fuel for the immune system. given via an intravenous drip for 30 minutes every three weeks, it works by blocking the activity of a molecule called pd-1 that is found on the surface of t-cells – the white blood cells that help the body fight infection.  blocking pd-1 has a number of effects on the body's immune system, including activating specific t-cells to attack and kill tumours, so they can't keep growing and multiplying.  more than 300 advanced bowel-cancer patients with these specific dna mutations were involved in the keynote-177 trial.  one group received standard chemotherapy every two weeks. the other group were given pembrolizumab for up to two years.  remarkably, patients who were given the immunotherapy drug saw their cancer remain stable for an average of 16.5 months, compared with 8.2 months for chemotherapy.  at the two-year mark, in about half of those on immunotherapy, their disease was still not worsening.  'there appears to be a lasting benefit,' says dr shiu, who is also associate professor in oncology at university college london's cancer institute.  'it seems you need immunotherapy to kick-start your immune system enough, so it recognises your cancer, to keep it under control for many years.'  diane reynolds was diagnosed with cancer early in 2016, after suffering what she initially believed was appendicitis. 'i eventually went to a&e,' she says.  'doctors thought it was appendicitis, too, and operated. but instead they found a big mass, underneath my appendix.'  test results showed it was bowel cancer – but it appeared to have been caught early, and diane had no further treatment.  six months later, however, scans revealed the disease had spread. 'there were multiple tumours in my abdomen, which had developed in the months after my surgery,' diane says.  she accepted an offer to join the keynote-177 trial, starting in december 2016, and was randomly selected to receive pembrolizumab. after three rounds, scans showed some inflammation on her lungs.  pembrolizumab has already shown to be effective in treating advanced melanoma skin cancer – which would previously have killed patients within a year or two – as well as lung cancer, pictured, and bladder cancer  this can be a side effect of immunotherapy, suggesting the immune system is over-reacting to the drug, and her treatment was suspended as a precaution. but the tests also revealed astonishing results.  'my tumours had shrunk by half,' she says. 'then at the end of april, the doctor told me i had no tumours. they had gone, and i didn't need any more treatment. i was amazed it happened so quickly.'  pembrolizumab has created significant excitement in the medical world. it has already shown to be effective in treating advanced melanoma skin cancer – which would previously have killed patients within a year or two – as well as lung cancer and bladder cancer. but researchers now believe it could prove effective against even more cancers.  'if you have this genetic subtype of cancer, it looks like in any tumour type you will respond to treatment,' dr shiu says. 'ongoing trials are seeing if immunotherapy, given instead of chemotherapy, will benefit these patients as much as the keynote-177 trial has shown.'  researchers continue to investigate whether immunotherapy could help a wider group of patients with bowel cancer when combined with other treatments. this is because previous trials found that advanced bowel cancer patients who do not have these genetic changes do not respond to immunotherapy alone.  in the meantime, the outlook appears brighter for at least some diagnosed with this bleak disease.  genevieve edwards, chief executive of bowel cancer uk, says 'these findings have the potential to be game changing for people with advanced bowel cancer with these specific genetic changes.  'while we're still some way off having pembrolizumab in routine use on the nhs, this is a promising step in the right direction.'"
health,"more than 200,000 britons unknowingly carry a gene that puts them at high risk of a fatal heart attack or sudden stroke before they reach middle age, according to a pivotal study.  the inherited condition, in which a genetic fault causes cholesterol levels to rise alarmingly from birth, is often symptomless. if it is spotted, cholesterol-lowering medication, including statins, is highly effective at bringing problems under control.  however, if untreated, patients can, and do, die before they reach middle age. some suffer heart attacks as children.  the new figures mean inherited high cholesterol – familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) – becomes one of the most common genetic conditions in the uk.  experts and campaigners hit out at the 'breathtakingly short-sighted' decision by the government's uk national screening committee not to test all children for fh alongside other hereditary illnesses.  proof of the devastating effects of genetic high cholesterol can be found in the tragic story of rianna wingett, pictured. in november 2009, the 11-year-old collapsed seconds after finishing a cross-country run on playing fields at her school in hornchurch, essexz. as she suffered a huge, fatal heart attack, she turned to a friend and said: 'i think i'm going to die'  the committee began considering screening children for fh in 2016, and rejected it two years later. campaigning charity heart uk appealed. however, in april it was told screening had been rejected again as a question mark still hung over the right age to offer a test.  fault causes a heart attack every day cholesterol is a fat made by the liver and is essential for a range of processes such as building cell walls. but if too much is in the blood, it contributes to the formation of inflamed 'spots' known as plaques inside artery walls. these plaques can rupture and trigger the formation of blood clots which then break away and travel through the circulation, risking heart attack or stroke. in those with familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh), a fault in at least three genes can affect ways in which the body processes cholesterol, leading to high levels in the blood. there is a 50:50 chance the genetic fault will be passed from a parent to a child. studies have shown the risk of heart disease is up to 13 times higher in people with untreated fh. about one person with fh has a heart attack every day in the uk, and a third do not survive. advertisement  this was despite a 10,000-patient study finding that testing between the ages of one and two was effective in picking up the condition. 'it's an absolute disgrace,' said heart uk chief executive jules payne. 'heart experts around the world agree that testing children should be routine. the committee got it totally wrong and disregarded the evidence.  'fh can be picked up with a simple finger-prick cholesterol test and cheek swab between the ages of one and two, at the same time as babies have a number of other routine check-ups and vaccinations. as it stands, adults and children are needlessly dying when we have effective preventative treatment.'  proof of the devastating effects of genetic high cholesterol can be found in the tragic story of rianna wingett.  in november 2009, the 11-year-old collapsed seconds after finishing a cross-country run on playing fields at her school in hornchurch, essex.  as she suffered a huge, fatal heart attack, she turned to a friend and said: 'i think i'm going to die.'  a post-mortem revealed that one of the main arteries to her heart was so clogged with cholesterol that the gap left for blood to flow through was no bigger than a pinprick.  leyton cooper also carried the genetic fault. the company manager was just 35 when he had a massive heart attack in september 2012. he was found on the floor of his home in oldham, near manchester and died in hospital. despite being slim and healthy, a major heart artery was found to be blocked with fatty plaques.  in the largest study of its kind, which was published last week in the journal circulation, experts examined data from seven million medical records and found a shocking one in 300 children and adults had signs of fh – making it almost twice as common as previously thought.  the researchers looked for mention in the records of higher-than-expected cholesterol readings, heart disease in young patients and other telltale signs of fh – fatty cholesterol can accumulate in lumps under the skin and inside the eye, causing a visible white ring around the iris, for instance.  they used this data to create a scoring system that could determine the true number of people who carried the gene. the new figures suggest that about 220,000 britons have fh – yet, at present, just 20,000 have been diagnosed.  gps spot the condition, or suspect it, in a number of ways including if a person has a suspiciously high total cholesterol above 7.5 or a family history of early heart disease.  if children are found to have fh, they are offered lifestyle advice including avoiding cholesterol-raising high-fat foods, pictured  when there is a very strong likelihood that a patient has the condition, they should be offered a genetic test to give a definitive diagnosis. as fh can be passed down through just one parent, other family members are also offered a gene check in a process known as cascade testing.  at present, if children are found to have fh, they are offered lifestyle advice including avoiding cholesterol-raising high-fat foods and staying active.  both of these measures can control levels of a type of cholesterol called ldl, which is known to be involved in the damage inside arteries that leads to cardiovascular disease.  as levels rise, usually by the age of nine, they are offered cholesterol-lowering statin medication.  the system of cascade testing typically begins with an adult in the family being picked up, often because they have developed angina – chest pain – or suffered a heart attack or stroke.  however, as professor kausik ray, the imperial college london cardiologist who co-authored the latest research, explains: 'by this time, you are firefighting. these patients will have been running high cholesterol levels since birth and have missed out on decades of treatment. we need to find a better way of identifying them.'  the benefits of treating fh from childhood are clear. in one major study, published last year, researchers followed youngsters with the condition who had been given statins for 20 years.  their incidence of cardiovascular disease was then compared with their parents, who also had the condition. just one per cent of the children – who by the end of the study were aged 39 – had suffered a major heart event.in the parent group, a quarter had been hit by a heart attack or stroke by this age, and one in 20 had died.  'with kids, we can give advice to eat healthily, to not put on weight and not smoke, and they can keep this up for life, alongside medication,' says prof ray. 'this hugely reduces the risk of illness and death and means we could offer children today born with fh a normal life expectancy.  'given what we know, to decide not to test them seems breathtakingly short-sighted.'"
health,"thousands of severely disabled children are being barred from returning to school because head teachers insist they cannot guarantee pupils' safety against coronavirus.  desperate parents of these children have been ordered not to bring them back to the classroom when many mainstream schools start reopening this week.  the majority of britain's schools for children with mental and physical disabilities – many of which also provide essential, specialist healthcare – will remain closed.  charity bosses fear the ban will be the last straw for those left to cope with round- the-clock care for their special-needs children during lockdown.  some parents have had to shoulder the entire burden as visits by care staff have also been withdrawn by local authorities.  it comes after campaigners claimed in this newspaper earlier in the month that councils were already 'using coronavirus as an excuse' to deny young disabled britons vital home care support.  max tattersall, pictured left, alongside his father, lee, and brother, xander, has several conditions and his family have found themselves without support during lockdown  the care sector, already stretched due to staff shortages, was further hit during the pandemic with staff absences and problems with supply of personal protective equipment (ppe).  charities warned that thousands of families had been suddenly cut adrift, with what little help they had withdrawn.  as part of the coronavirus act, which came into effect on march 25, local authorities were granted the power to withdraw services – so-called care easements – to prioritise healthcare workers' time for patients with the most pressing needs.  the stroke patient who became desperate to give it all away a man in brazil became so benevolent after a clot on the brain that he almost gave away everything he owned. shortly after his illness in 2016, the 49-year-old began giving away cash to friends and strangers and treating children to huge quantities of sweets. only the intervention of his wife stopped him emptying the family coffers. a ct scan of the brain revealed reduced blood flow – caused by the stroke – had damaged 'wiring' in areas linked with personality traits, such as generosity, according to a report in the journal neurocase. advertisement  this means they were no longer legally obliged to meet disabled people's support needs so long as their basic human rights are upheld. at least eight english councils enacted such plans.  'after two months of lockdown, many families we speak to are at breaking point,' says dan scorer, head of policy and public affairs at mental health charity mencap. 'the balance must be struck between safeguarding children from real health risks and supporting families who are desperately struggling with the enormous responsibility.'  it had been ruled by the government that schools for disabled pupils should remain open during the lockdown. in fact, recent figures show that just five per cent of such children were able to attend, as many schools shut their doors to all but the most vulnerable.  now new guidance requires special-needs schools to adopt protective measures – including keeping children two metres apart and encouraging 'good respiratory hygiene'.  teachers warn that the measures are unworkable. adrian carver, head teacher at downs view school for children with complex disabilities in brighton, says: 'the government clearly does not understand the reality of working with 200-odd disabled children.  'with little at-home support for parents from the local health authority, it's understandable that parents are desperate for the school to open.  'but i can't guarantee pupil safety – social distancing is impossible.  'these children need teachers practically sitting at their shoulder all the time. they put their hands in their mouth constantly, then touch objects or other children or staff. and the government remains adamant that teachers don't need ppe.'  the stand-off is already taking a toll on the health of anxious parents caught in the middle.  many classrooms are being prepared with distanced chairs and tables, such as at st joseph's catholic primary school in hertford, pictured, ahead of the return of thousands of pupils next week  sophia tattersall, 40, and her husband lee, 48, from barnsley, yorkshire, are parents to max – a ten-year-old with several conditions including epilepsy, brain damage and a metabolic disease called homocystinuria, a condition in which the body cannot digest protein properly.  max needs specially adapted meals and supplements, some of which are fed via a tube.  disabled from birth, max is also partially sighted and non-verbal.  sophia says: 'we were barely coping when he had a full-time school placement and a weekly overnight stay with a carer.  'but as soon as lockdown was introduced, on march 23, the local authority and the school stopped it all and we've been left to cope on our own since.'  sophia, who is also mother to xander, 13, gave up her job as a legal secretary to care for max. he needs feeding six times a day, his nappy changed at least five times daily, a cocktail of medication and frequent baths to ward off infections. he also suffers regular seizures – up to 25 a day.  adrian carver, head teacher at downs view school for children with complex disabilities in brighton, pictured outside 10 downing street in 2018, says new protective measures for special schools are unworkable  about six weeks after max's care provisions were slashed, electronics salesman lee suffered a sudden heart attack. 'i've no doubt that the stress of caring for max full-time was a huge contributing factor,' sophia says.  annette king, also from barnsley, has a nine-year-old son, alessandro, who has quadriplegic cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair. on the friday before lockdown was announced, annette, 41, received a text message from alessandro's school informing her that it was closed, and ordering parents not to contact them further.  'i've had no indication of when this will change,' she says.  sam loizou, a 46-year-old project manager from wiltshire, has been forced to care full-time for her 17-year-old son henry, who has severe autism and epilepsy and is unable to wash and dress by himself.  'the school is currently only taking children of key workers who have no one else to look after them. for all the other children, it's just assumed the parents will cope. and we've had no correspondence about when this will change. the council has provided no support.'  richard kramer, chief executive of disability charity sense, warns: 'these families are simply being forgotten.'  for each vulnerable child, like max, schools are required to work with parents and social workers on a risk assessment. the outcome determines whether it is safe for them to return to school.  in a statement, barnsley council said: 'we are working closely with parents and carers, schools and settings to ensure that all children and young people with special educational needs are safe and well, but also to support discussions and plans for children and young people to return to education.'  barnsley council also say that restrictions to school places have been in place 'to stop the spread of covid-19', and to protect 'those in the shielding category, deemed extremely clinically vulnerable.'  barnsley council, which meets at the town hall, pictured, says it is ensuring all those with special educational needs are safe and well and that restrictions to places have been made 'to stop the spread of covid-19'  however sophia has presented the local authority with several letters from max's specialist consultant stating that he does not meet this critera. 'with his epilepsy worsening at home, and my husband's health deteriorating, i believe school is the best option.'  sense now wants the government to offer an alternative solution, such as increased at-home support, or part-time day services, possibly outdoors, to reduce infection risk.  'parents should not be forced to choose between their child's safety and their own mental health,' says mr kramer. 'ultimately it ends with family breakdown and vulnerable children being placed outside the home – either in hospitals or in an emergency placement.'  sophia has managed to secure three-times-a-week visits from a social care worker, who takes max for a walk in nearby parkland, giving the family some respite.  on thursday – after nearly nine weeks of silence – the school told sophia it is investigating max's safe return to school. no date has been set. 'it took six weeks of fighting, and for my husband to have a heart attack, before we were deemed worthy of help,' she says.  'i can't help but think – how many other families are facing the same?'"
health,"groups should picnic in the shape of a parallelogram, hexagon or pentagon if they want to meet together while still maintaining social distancing and good hygiene, experts have said.  from monday, up to six people will be allowed to meet both in public spaces and in private gardens in england for the first time in two months.  there are concerns the uk's stringent two-metre contact gap will be hard to abide by when hordes of people descend on beaches and parks after being confined to their homes for all but essential travel since march 24.  britons meeting for picnics from next week should form a hexagon (left), pentagon (top right) or a series of triangles known as a parallelogram (right)  there are concerns the uk's stringent two metre contact gap will be hard to abide by when hordes of people descend on beaches and parks. pictured: young people by the riverside in ilkley, west yorkshire, yesterday  but experts from oxford university said putting six people in a hexagon or pentagon could be a safe and space-efficient way to adhere to the rules and maintain good hygiene.  mathematician and bbc tv personality bobby seagull has suggested sitting in a series of triangles to form a parallelogram.  separate experts have advised against barbecues because sharing food and cooking utensils could exacerbate the spread of the virus - despite the government telling britons they are allowed.  professor sally bloomfield, of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, said picnics were much safer as long as people brought their own food and cutlery.  jason lotay, professor of pure mathematics at oxford university, said putting six people in a hexagon, each with a two-metre distance between them, was probably the best option. it would also require just 10.4 square metres of space.  the maximum distance between two people would be four metres at the shape's widest point, while the average distance from person to person would be around 2.29m, according to the mathematician.  if britons wanted to take up even less room, then one person could go in the middle to form a pentagon. this would require a smaller area of just 9.5 square metres.  but, despite taking up less space overall, professor lotay warned groups would actually be further apart from their friends, with an average 2.72m between them.  the four home nations now have significantly different sets of lockdown rules in place. for example, in england from monday six people can meet up outdoors but in scotland from today it is eight people  how is the lockdown being eased in england from monday? what's changing? from monday, people can meet outside in groups of up to six as long as those from different households continue to socially distance. - can i visit family and friends? yes . this means that family groups of no more than six can meet in parks and private gardens for chats and even barbecues. - how far am i allowed to travel? there are no mileage limits set for how far you are allowed to drive to visit family and friends in england, northern ireland and scotland, but the general advice is to remain in your local area as much as possible. however, people in wales will still not be allowed to travel more than five miles from their home for any reason except work or to purchase essentials. great, can we hug? sadly no. you still cannot risk infection by being too close. the same goes for handshakes or kissing. if young children from different households are part of the group, they must not share paddling pools, climbing frames, slides or anything that would encourage them to be closer than two metres to each other. can i stay overnight? staying overnight at someone else's home will still not be allowed anywhere in the uk, while even going indoors for any other reason than to access a garden or use the bathroom is prohibited. however scottish first minister nicola sturgeon has advised that if the distance travelled to meet someone means that you have to use their bathroom, then 'perhaps you shouldn't be doing it'. can we barbecue? yes, but you must wash your hands, be careful about passing food or plates and keep 6ft apart. how about entering their house? only if there is no other way of getting to the back of the property. what about using the toilet? you can, but you must thoroughly clean any surfaces you touch. to be extra safe, you could even use a paper towel to open and close bathroom doors and perhaps consider using a kitchen roll to dry hands rather than a towel. so what if it rains? you will have to stand under an umbrella or leave. you cannot shelter in someone else's home. can we camp in the garden? no, boris johnson said he did not want you to stay overnight. do i only have to see the same group? no, you can meet different people at different times, but try not to see too many in quick succession. can those shielding take part? no, they must continue to shield if they're in the clinically extremely vulnerable group and have had a letter from their gp. what about the over-70s? if they are not in the shielding group. we are a family of six – can we meet anyone else? no. the guidelines say you can meet only up to six people at any one time. can we visit a relative in a care home garden? it would depend on circumstances and the care home's management. - what else will i be allowed to do under the new measures? in england, monday's lockdown easing will signal the reopening of schools to allow students in nurseries, early-years settings, and reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class. some shops are also set to reopen, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations. - when might restrictions be eased further? boris johnson has flagged that more restrictions will be eased on june 15, beginning with the reopening of other non-essential retail shops such as fashion or homeware retail. other businesses, such as pubs, hairdressers and cinemas will have to wait until july before they can reopen, the government has previously said. advertisement  professor lotay told the telegraph: 'of course, things are much better for the person in the middle, who is 2m from everyone, but worse for everyone else, who now have an average of 2.86m to anyone else.  'i would probably say that efficiency is given by the total area required and minimising the maximum distance between any two people, in which case the pentagram model is better.  'however, as i say, it means that one person gets preferential treatment, and it is worse for everyone else.'  the uk government has insisted the public must keep a two-metre contact gap from people from other households, despite the science about its effectiveness being murky.  it is double the one metre gap recommended by the world health organisation (who), which is the distance permitted in hong kong, singapore, france and china.  australia, germany and the netherlands recommend 1.5 metres.  the scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) advice is that there is a 'considerable reduction' in risk at a two-metre distance, compared to a smaller gap. but it is not based on any scientific research.  mathematician bobby seagull, who hosts the bbc two series, monkman & seagull's genius adventures, said the most efficient way to keep people the correct distance apart is to form a series of triangles. when a group of six people do this it forms a 'parallelogram'.  mr seagull said his solution was the best way to picnic without disrupting others who are also trying to social distance in busy parks moving forward.  ahead of the next wave of lockdown loosening on monday, thousands of sun-seekers are expected to jump the gun and arrange gatherings at parks and beaches as temperatures soar to highs of 82f.  supermarkets reported last night that shoppers were already spending record sums on sausages, beer, wine and ice cream in anticipation of weekend barbecues and picnics.  the steady lifting of draconian restrictions kicks in from next week, but last night restless rule-breakers spurred on by the announcement were pictured together in outdoor spots across the country.  police chiefs complained their officers face an impossible situation of trying to force the public to comply with existing rules while knowing many of these curbs are set to be dropped on monday.  constables have ordered britons to obey the lockdown in its current form and not pre-empt monday's changes, warning that flouters face fines.  northumbria's labour police and crime commissioner kim mcguinness said: 'the pm must have known he was going to create a situation that is difficult to police. the messaging looks like it was rushed forward to help ministers in a difficult position.'  anthony stansfeld, the conservative police and crime commissioner for thames valley, said: 'people should obey the rules – things are only just beginning to open up, so please don't pre-empt them.  'all the relaxation of lockdown is being carefully timed by the government's chief scientists for good reason.  'it's far better if people wait and do things at the proper time, so please don't jump the gun. a bit more freedom is coming on monday, so i urge everyone to be patient.'  merseyside police warned that people would be fined if they turned up to parks and beaches in large groups across the city this weekend.  superintendent jonathan davies said: 'i know people will be tempted to get outside. this is a reminder that the rules on spending time with only one other person from another household remains in place this weekend.'  three of the nation's top scientists - all on the government's sage panel of experts steering the crisis response - have also voiced concerns that lockdown is being lifted 'too early'.  prof peter horby this morning lined up behind sir jeremy farrar and prof john edmunds to break ranks and caution measures were being relaxed when the infection rate was still not low enough.  the 'r' reproduction rate sits just below one between 0.7 and 0.9, and the government announced there were 324 new covid-19 deaths yesterday, following a pattern of decline.  professor horby, chairman of the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (nervtag) and a sage member, said britain could not afford to lose control of the virus.  he told bbc radio 4 this morning: 'we really can't go back to a situation where we've got the numbers of cases and deaths we've had in the past.'  speaking about the new test and trace infrastructure, he added: 'as we know, it's not yet fully operational so that is where the risk lies.'  it followed representations from sir jeremy and professor edmunds yesterday.  four nations, four lockdowns: how different rules now apply in england, scotland, wales and northern ireland (so who's following what science?)  byjack maidment, deputy political editor for mailonline  long-awaited changes are being made to the uk's coronavirus lockdown with the four home nations now adopting different approaches to the loosening of draconian rules.  boris johnson set out his plans which mostly only relate to england at a downing street press conference last night with those changes coming into force on monday.  but more limited changes in scotland came into force today while wales and northern ireland are also doing their own thing.  below is a breakdown of how different rules apply in different parts of the country.  england  perhaps the most eye-grabbing change announced by mr johnson last night was that as of monday groups of up to six people will be allowed to meet up outdoors.  social distancing rules to stay at least two metres apart remain in place but the six people can be from different households.  this is a much more flexible approach than has been taken in scotland and wales.  these group gatherings can take place either outdoors in a public park or within a private garden but people have been told to be careful if guests need to travel through a house to get to a garden. barbecues are allowed.  england's new rules mean there is no limit on how far people can travel from their home.  meanwhile, people can also exercise as much as they want - a change which was announced by mr johnson in his first wave of loosening.  when it comes to shops, all non-essential premises will be allowed to start reopening from june 15. that means most high street stores like clothes shops and shoe shops.  other businesses, such as pubs, hairdressers and cinemas will have to wait until july before they can reopen, the government has previously said.  primary schools and nurseries will begin their phased reopening from june 1 while some year 10 and 12 students will be able to return to secondary schools from june 15.  scotland  nicola sturgeon's lockdown changes came into force as of today, in time for what is expected to be a sunny weekend with highs of up to 80f.  the first minister's plans allow groups of up to eight people to meet up outside.  however, they must all be from just two households. similar to in england, these gatherings can either take place in private gardens or in outdoor spaces like parks.  one difference is that people are not supposed to go into someone else's house - even if it that is the only way to get to the garden.  social distancing rules remain at the two metre figure while there is no legal limit on travel away from home.  however, the scottish government has encouraged people to 'stay local' which means not travelling more than approximately five miles.  ms sturgeon has advised that if the distance travelled to meet someone means that you have to use their bathroom, then 'perhaps you shouldn't be doing it'.  people in scotland are also allowed to exercise as much as they want outside.  scotland's easing will enable people to visit garden centres and play some sports where social distancing can easily be maintained, such as golf and tennis.  there is less clarity north of the border on when non-essential shops could reopen with the scottish government yet to set a date for the return of the high street.  scotland's education plan is also much more cautious than england's with schools not expected to start reopening until august 11.  in scotland, there is no set timeline for when more measures might be lifted.  wales  first minister mark drakeford set out his plans for lockdown loosening this morning.  outdoor gatherings will be permitted from monday but only with people from two different households.  however, the number of people who can meet up outdoors in a socially distanced way is unlimited.  the welsh plan also allows people to use gardens for their gatherings although like in scotland people are not allowed to go into other people's homes.  in wales there is a broad five mile limit on travel away from home although the welsh government has stressed travel should remain 'local' and not generally further than five miles, seemingly giving some room for interpretation.  people in wales are also allowed to exercise as much as they want outside but no date has yet been set for the return of non-essential shops.  however, mr drakeford said today that non-essential retail businesses that can comply with social distancing rules should start to prepare to reopen over the next three weeks.  mr drakeford said a decision on whether they will reopen will be taken at the next review of lockdown measures on june 18 and will depend on scientific and medical evidence.  no date has yet been set for the reopening of schools.  northern ireland  northern ireland was the first of the four home nations to move on loosening rules relating to socialising.  groups of between four and six people are allowed to meet outdoors.  they can all be from different households and social distancing at two metres must be stuck to.  gardens are allowed to be used for those gatherings but access to another person's house is not permitted.  people can travel as far as they want from their home - just like in england - with no restrictions on the amount of outdoor exercise allowed.  some non-essential shops are expected to begin reopening from june 15.  pending the country's rate of transmission remaining below one, a host of further restrictions are set to be eased in northern ireland on june 8.  that could include the reopening of outdoor sports facilities, car showrooms and some non-essential retail stores.  outdoor weddings with a maximum of 10 people are also set to be allowed and hotels will be able to start taking forward bookings at their own risk.  however, there is a longer wait for schools with pupils not expected to return to the classroom until the new academic year begins in september."
health,"professor john edmunds said he would have preferred to see infections driven down further before relaxing the lockdown  britain is 'taking a risk' by unlocking the country with more than 8,000 new coronavirus cases a day and an 'unproven' test and trace system, a government scientific adviser has warned.  professor john edmunds said he would have preferred to see infections driven down further before relaxing the lockdown because the outbreak is still teetering on the verge of spiralling back out of control.  boris johnson has announced that, from monday, people will be permitted to meet in groups of up to six people, shops will reopen and some children will go back to school.  professor edmunds, an epidemiologist at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said the prime minister had 'clearly made a political decision' because the threat of a second peak remains high.  he said that, even if the 'untested' contact tracing scheme goes smoothly, the country could still suffer 80 deaths a day until a vaccine is developed.  his comments come as the crucial reproduction 'r' value remains at between 0.7 and 0.9. the r rate denotes the number of other people an infected patient will pass the sickness on to and it must stay at 1 or below or britain will face another crisis.  two other sage experts lined up behind professor edmunds this morning to caution that measures were being relaxed when the infection rate was still not low enough.  professor edmunds said: 'many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that then means we have fewer cases occurring before we relax the measures.  the lockdown rules are increasingly varied across the uk as the home nations butt heads on easing restrictions  'if we had incidence at a lower level then, even if r went up a little bit, we wouldn't be in a position where we're overwhelming the health service rapidly.  'we could tolerate a little bit [of an increase in infections]. at the moment, with relatively high incidence,relaxing the measures and also with an untested track and trace system, i think we are taking some risk here.  'even if that risk does pay off, and we manage to keep the incidence flat, we're keeping it flat at quite a high level - 8,000 new infections a day.  'if there's a 1 per cent infection fatality rate that's 80 deaths per day, if there's half a per cent, that's 40 per day.  'that's the amount of deaths we might expect to see going forward. that's clearly a political decision, it's not a scientific decision.  'it's pretty clear to me the direction of travel is we're starting to relax and we're going to keep the reproduction level at one, but that means we're keeping the incidence at this level.'  sir jeremy farrar, director of the wellcome trust and sage member said in a twitter post that he 'agreed with john' on the clear science advice, appearing to reference sage colleague professor john edmunds, who said on friday the government was 'taking risks' by relaxing measures from monday  the government charts previously stated that level four required 'current social distancing measures and restrictions'  confusion over boris's alert message what boris told the liaison committee on wednesday: ministers have insisted throughout that the lockdown would only be eased when the five tests were met. however, the government has also set up the covid alert system which describes what people can expect to happen at each level. at the liaison committee on wednesday, mr johnson said on the covid alert: 'we're coming down, the covid alert system, we're coming down from level four to level three we hope, we're taking a decision tomorrow.' what boris said last night: 'this package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that r below one. i cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious,' he said. 'it is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. that is not my achievement or the government's achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus.' advertisement  professor edmunds' comments will raise further questions about why boris johnson has eased the lockdown while the coronavirus alert level remains so high.  despite the pm saying the government's five tests have been met and it is safe to start relaxing restrictions, no10 confirmed that the alert level remains at four.  ministers have insisted throughout that the lockdown would only be eased when the five tests were met.  however, the government has also set up the covid alert system which describes what people can expect to happen at each level.  there was no alert status slide used at the briefing last night, and mr johnson did not refer to the level.  under the easing in england, different households will be able to see family and friends in groups of six from monday, although social distancing measures will still have to be followed.  they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned. mr johnson said that meant barbecues are possible.  schools will start to reopen from monday, and non-essential shops will follow from june 15.  professor edmunds said that without a vaccine or viable treatment at the ready, the government cannot ease restrictions much more than it already has.  he added: 'the issue is clearly there's a need to get the economy restarted and get people back to their jobs.  'and clearly there's a social and mental health need to allow people to meet with friends and family and so on.  'a targeted approach is good, it's not putting everybody in lockdown which of course allows the economy and for us to go back to some level of normality.  'but none of us think - that have looked at this in any great detail - that [the track and trace scheme] will be sufficient to be able to hold the reproduction number below one.  'we will still have to have significant numbers of wider social distancing measures in place.  environment secretary george eustice struggled to explain the logic behind the arrangements in a round of interviews today  boris johnson (pictured in downing street last night) is facing questions over his lockdown easing today as it emerged the coronavirus alert level has not been reduced  'the basic reproduction number for this virus is three, maybe even more. and so we cannot relax our guard by very much at all.'  professor peter horby, chairman of the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (nervtag) and a sage member, backed professor edmunds and said britain could not afford to lose control of the virus.  he told bbc radio 4 this morning: 'we really can't go back to a situation where we've got the numbers of cases and deaths we've had in the past.'  labour's shadow health minister justin madders said: 'it is crucial for all of us that the government gets this right.  'easing lockdown must be done as safely as possible. it will only work if there are effective, flexible and local systems in place that have the confidence of the public to ensure that we avoid a second peak of infections.'  sir jeremy farrar, director of the wellcome trust and sage member said in a twitter post that he 'agreed with john' on the clear science advice.  sir jeremy also said the newly-introduced nhs test and trace system needed to be 'fully working' before measures were eased.  he wrote: 'covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in england. agree with john & clear science advice.  'tti (test, trace and isolate) has to be in place, fully working, capable dealing any surge immediately, locally responsive, rapid results & infection rates have to be lower. and trusted.'  environment secretary george eustice struggled to explain the logic behind the new lockdown loosening in a round of interviews on friday.  he admitted that up to six people from different households being able to meet in parks and gardens will not help families of six but said the government 'have to draw a line somewhere'.  speaking on bbc breakfast, mr eustice said: 'we think that six is about a sensible level. we know that the risk of transmission outdoors is actually very low, but obviously if you've got lots of people crowded in a garden, if you've got two families of six crowded in, obviously that starts to be more difficult to maintain social distancing.'  pushed again on whether a family of six could meet anyone else, he added: 'obviously if they are six on their own than the answer is these rules don't really help them very much if they want to meet as a full family.  'but for instance if claire (questioner) wanted to go with two of the children and take them to see for instance their grandparents if they have grandparents, or uncles, they would be able to do so.  'so you have to draw a line somewhere otherwise it goes on and on.'"
health,"like everyone else, normal life for the mosley family has been on hold since late march. but that is about to change. or at least partially.  we may not be able to book a table at a restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary next week or plan an evening with friends in the pub any time soon. but we will, finally, be able to have a small family reunion in our garden.  our younger children, dan, 25, and kate, 20, are at home with us, but we haven’t been able to see our two older sons for far too long. alex, 29, lives and works in london, so he will be able to pop over easily, while jack, 28, plans to make a day trip from manchester.  after months locked up at home this feels like a big step towards some kind of normality, so i am thrilled, but i am also nervous.  my mum, joan, is 91 and self-isolating at her home in dorset, and although we are keen to visit her, she’s vulnerable, and i don’t know how we will manage all the practicalities of social distancing and protecting her safety.  because no matter how much this easing of restrictions feels like freedom, the threat of covid-19 is still very real — it’s still out there.  scroll down for michael mosley's diet to fight coronavirus  because no matter how much this easing of restrictions feels like freedom, the threat of covid-19 is still very real  that is why, starting today and all next week, i will share with you, in exclusive extracts from my new book, all i’ve learned about the virus and how to combat it as we move into this next phase.  right from the start i avidly read everything i could find about the virus and how it spreads. i was appalled by what i discovered.  this virus is a monstrous mutant hybrid of other coronaviruses that have come before: it can spread, undetected, through entire communities, infect almost everyone it meets, then erupt and kill in a seemingly random fashion.  except, as it soon became clear, the covid pattern isn’t random at all. it is now known that the people most at risk of complications and death from covid-19 are those over 60, particularly those who are significantly overweight and have other health issues, including heart disease and diabetes.  it has been shocking to discover that one in four of those who’ve died during this outbreak had type 2 diabetes. for the past eight years, since i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, i have been writing about the importance of losing weight if you have a large waist and raised blood sugars.  as well as weight loss, i’ve also written about good gut health, intermittent fasting, ways of reducing stress and getting better sleep. and one of the threads linking all my work has been the way these lifestyle changes will not only shrink your waistline but also bolster your immunity.  pooling all my years of research, i’ve come up with a plan to combat corona, so that you and your family can get fighting fit now that lockdown is easing.  be under no doubt — this virus remains a real danger to us, but i do believe we can beat it.  i suspect that my wife, clare (a gp) and i may already have done so. at the beginning of march, we both had a classic, persistent, covid cough. although we are not exactly youthful (i’m 63 and clare is 58) we eat healthily, sleep well and exercise, which is why, i think, we only got it mildly. our sons, jack, who is a medic, and dan, have had it, too, and being young and healthy, they escaped unscathed.  we were fortunate. an older friend had covid-19, and he got it badly. he spent two weeks in bed, coughing, sweating, short of breath and aching all over. his wife was worried he wouldn’t pull through. thankfully he did.  so far, no one we know has ended up in hospital. but there’s no doubting this virus can be a terrifyingly effective killer. it’s certainly hard to believe that only a few months ago we were being assured by our government that the threat it posed was ‘low’.  but we will, finally, be able to have a small family reunion in our garden  back in february, as covid-19 started to creep its sinister tentacles across the world, i was promoting a book i’d written, called fast asleep, and i was preparing for a filming trip to australia.  as a science journalist i have, over the years, made a number of documentaries about the dangers of a microbe jumping from animals to humans and creating a devastating worldwide pandemic.  i have also written about how vulnerable we are to the emergence of a sly, new pathogen.  but i never thought it would be as bad as this. i assumed, as so many others did, that when a new, infectious agent appeared, we would be able to use the high-tech tools at our disposal to stamp it out. it was only when the horror reached europe, sweeping through italy and then spain, that we all realised this was a far bigger problem than any of us had imagined.  when covid-19 began to spread through the uk, i was mainly concerned about my mother and jack, a junior doctor. he had been working on wards with covid-19 patients and was due to start in intensive care when he began experiencing signs of the virus in early march.  he developed a cough, fever and then noticed that he had lost his sense of smell — a tell-tale sign. after the regulatory seven days’ self-isolating, he recovered and went back to work. he wasn’t offered a test, but it seems likely that he’d had covid-19.  his younger brother, dan, went through a similar experience. dan had been living and working in melbourne for the past year, but when countries all over the world began closing their borders because of the virus, he decided to fly home.  the day after he arrived home he got a call from one of his former flatmates, a medic, saying that he and five friends had developed a cough and fever and had tested positive for covid-19.  the following day dan started developing symptoms: he felt achy, cold and tired, and looked sweaty and flushed with red eyes and a mild cough. he was ill for a couple of days and swiftly recovered, apart from his sense of smell, which still hasn’t fully returned.  the fact this virus can be carried by people who have few, if any symptoms, meant, in the early days, it could fly around the world with ease. it might have killed millions globally and brought the nhs to the brink, but there are some positives to be had.  the scientific effort has been phenomenal, and having talked to leading researchers i believe better treatments, and even a vaccine, are just around the corner.  but we can’t just wait for the scientists to save us. if you want to slash your chances of getting covid-19, you need to keep washing your hands, maintain social distancing and apply a liberal dose of common sense.  on top of this, i believe we can reduce our risk of ending up in intensive care by taking steps — right now — to protect and bolster our body’s immune system.  this has never been more important, because if you’re exposed to the virus, you will rely on your immune system to fight it off.  the reason this virus is lethal to some, but not others, is because some people, particularly those who are older or in ill health, experience a so-called ‘cytokine storm’ as their immune system battles the viral invasion.  instead of just attacking the virus, their immune system goes into overdrive and attacks healthy tissue as well. the result is extensive damage to lungs, the heart, the kidneys and even the brain.  one way to minimise the chance of this happening and to ensure your immune system is working is by losing excess weight. in today’s weekend magazine i show you how using recipes from my fast 800 diet.  it’s also key to boost the levels of ‘good’ bacteria in your gut, to start exercising regularly and to get a good night’s sleep.  while we’ve been at home, clare, dan, kate and i have done what we can to bolster our immune systems. we take turns to cook healthy mediterranean-style meals, with lots of oily fish, nuts, vegetables and legumes.  clare has been making lots of fermented food, including sauerkraut and kimchi from ingredients such as cabbage, ginger and salt, while i have been producing home-made yoghurt which is rich in bacteria.  fermented foods are full of living bacteria (probiotics) which keep your gut microbiome in good shape, and a healthy microbiome forms a critical part of your immune defences.  to keep our bodies, brains and immune systems healthy, we head out for a run or walk every day, and we do lots of resistance exercises, such as press-ups and squats. these are important for maintaining muscle and also help increase deep sleep. clare and i have also got into the habit of spending 15 minutes a day practising mindfulness.  although the number of fatalities in the uk is finally falling, this crisis is far from over. to win this war it is vital to learn everything we can about the enemy. it is also essential to support the soldiers of our immune system, which may soon be battling on our behalf.  in this life-changing series, i will show you how.  covid-19 by dr michael mosley is published by short books at £6.99. © 2020 michael mosley  know your enemy! day 1: the invasion begins you are in the supermarket when someone nearby coughs or sneezes. viruses travel in droplets of fluid, and a single cough or sneeze can produce around 3,000 droplets, which travel from your mouth at almost 50mph and release at least two hundred million virus particles into the air. the heavier droplets will fall on the floor or onto nearby shelves of food, but the really small ones can remain suspended for up to 30 minutes or travel through the air just as cigarette smoke does for up to three hours. you can, in theory, easily inhale viral particles by walking through an area where someone has just coughed, although that is unlikely. you are more likely to pick up viruses on your hands from the droplets that have fallen onto the trolley handle or the food that you are about to buy. before you get to the check-out, and without thinking, you rub your eye or touch the inside of your nose. the virus is now in and it will immediately start ‘looking’ for cells to invade. the good news is that your body has evolved numerous defences to protect you against just such a threat. the bad news is that your body has a fatal flaw. on the surface of many of your cells there are receptors for an enzyme called ace2. these receptors are found throughout your body, including your throat, lungs, eyes and the inside of your nose. the spikes on the surface of the sars-cov-2 virus are just the right shape to lock onto these ace2 receptors and bind tightly. once that happens, it is like inserting a key into a lock and turning. the human cell opens up and the virus slips in. that is why it is so important to wash your hands whenever you have been outside your home to get rid of any trace of virus you might have picked up, and to resist the urge to touch your nose or rub your eyes before doing so. the first place the virus is likely to infect is the cells that line your nose and the back of the throat. some virus particles will travel down into your gut, where they latch onto ace2 receptors in your intestines and could cause diarrhoea. others may go down your windpipe and into your lungs, which are filled with ace2 receptors, making them a wonderful breeding ground for this virus. once the virus gets inside a human cell, it immediately releases its genetic material (rna) and gets to work to hijack the machinery of the cell. your cells are like mini factories, geared up to make the bits and pieces your body needs to function, but the virus takes over all that machinery and uses it to churn out endless copies of itself, which it releases into your body ready to infect more cells. it does this at phenomenal speed. in just one day, the virus can multiply itself a millionfold. when your cells are invaded by a foreign microbe, they are supposed to send out distress signals, warning your body that it is being attacked. but this virus has found a way to effectively silence the alarms. that way, it can hide from your defence system while it continues to multiply. another trick the virus uses is to cover the spikes that stick out of its surface with sugars (known as glycans) as a kind of disguise which helps them travel through the body evading your immune system. normally, if you get flu, you quickly develop a cough or fever as a sign that your body has been attacked and your immune system is trying to fight back. it is also a very useful warning to other people that they need to steer clear of you. but because this virus can multiply undetected, it can be five days before you start showing symptoms — and some people never do. these ‘asymptomatic carriers’ continue with their daily lives, blissfully unaware that they are now shedding potentially lethal viruses everywhere they go. day 2: growth by stealth you probably feel absolutely fine, completely unaware of the virus spreading through your body, jumping rapidly from cell to cell, invading your bloodstream and flooding through your digestive system. before the lockdown, you might have hopped on a plane, gone to a football match or a party, shedding viruses every time you talked, coughed or sneezed. day 3 or 4: the fight is under way now you are shedding so many viruses that you could infect someone by shaking hands or simply sitting at the same table in a workplace canteen. your immune system realises that something is seriously wrong and your body is preparing to launch its first line of defence: releasing proteins called interferons. these ‘interfere’ with the virus’s ability to replicate and spread. as well as trying to stop the virus reproducing, interferons recruit neutrophils which are a type of white blood cell. when alerted, these fighters head for the infection, determined to neutralise the enemy. another clever part of your immune system are ‘macrophages’, which are scavenger cells whose job is to roam around and eat anything they come across that looks suspicious (macrophage means ‘big eater’). at this early stage your body is engaged in a race between the virus’s ability to multiply, and your body’s attempt to fight it off. you may notice a mild cough, a bit of a temperature, or nothing at all. if your immune system is effective, any symptoms will be mild and will gradually disappear. you will remain infectious for about a week. but you’ve had a very lucky escape. day 5: symptoms appear and may worsen by now you are likely to be showing symptoms. you might get a cough, a sore throat, a fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, aching muscles and you could notice you’ve lost your sense of taste and smell. these symptoms are caused not just by the virus, but by your body’s attempt to fight it off. if your immune system is strong and functioning properly, these symptoms will be mild and will gradually disappear. if you are not so lucky, the virus will travel from your throat down into your lungs, making that dry cough worse. you may find it hard to breathe, develop a fever (typically over 38c) and start to feel real bone ache. at this stage, your body launches a new wave of defence which aims to specifically target the invader causing the problem. special ‘t-killer cells’ are released to seek out and destroy cells which have been infected and taken over by covid-19 as well as antibodies. antibodies perform different functions. so-called ‘neutralising’ antibodies latch onto the viruses and stop them infecting even more cells. others make virus particles stick together, making them an easier target for the rest of the immune system. on top of that, antibodies activate the hungry white cells, called phagocytes, which ‘swallow’ anything the antibody has latched onto. doctors can test your blood for rising levels of antibodies, and clearly this is a good sign that your body is doing what it can to fight the virus, but it can come very late in the illness — sometimes it can be too late to be effective enough. day 7: the virus takes hold right now, if you haven’t been able to mount a good antibody response, your symptoms could start to worsen significantly — this is more likely if you are older or have a pre-existing health condition. you could experience difficulty breathing, or develop a high temperature, a continuous cough or lose your sense of smell. if you’re concerned, this is the time to ring 111 for advice. otherwise, make sure you drink plenty of water, rest and put your trust in your immune system to ride to your rescue. days 9-11: should you call 999? by now you should have recovered — around 80 per cent of those infected will be feeling better. but 15 per cent will find they are becoming increasingly breathless and other symptoms have started to get much worse. five per cent may well need to go to hospital. although your immune system is cranking out t-killer cells, antibodies and cytokines in a bid to halt its progress, it can overcompensate in some people, releasing excessive amounts of cytokines. doctors call this a ‘cytokine storm’ — and it is increasingly what brings people to hospital. in its eagerness to destroy the virus, your body’s own immune system destroys healthy tissue as well. enormous collateral damage is inevitable. you will have blood tests and you may be offered a ct scan of your lungs to identify fuzzy spots (called ‘ground-glass opacities’) caused by a build-up of fluid in the tiny air sacs (alveoli) where oxygen is absorbed. these are a sign that you may have started to develop a very nasty form of pneumonia called acute-respiratory-distress syndrome (ards). you may be offered drugs (such as the anti-inflammatory tocilizumab) to counter the reaction going on in your body, or one of many drugs currently on trial. but once your air sacs become damaged or fill with fluid and debris, you will struggle to get enough oxygen into your body to keep your brain and other organs properly supplied. at this point, you may be sent to intensive care. the medical staff will have to swiftly decide whether you are given extra oxygen via cpap (a machine which uses a hose and mask or nosepiece to deliver a constant and steady supply of oxygen) or whether you should go on a ventilator. by this point the battle between your immune system and the virus isn’t confined to your lungs. it will have spread through your blood, far and wide, to your liver, kidneys, guts and brain. the virus may trigger increased blood clotting and inflammation in the heart, which is why anyone with pre-existing heart disease or high blood pressure is so much more vulnerable. once the virus gets to your brain it can cause delirium and seizures. very sadly, many people who end up on a ventilator in intensive care don’t survive. but thanks to the dedication of nhs staff, and rapid advances in our understanding of this disease, an increasing number now do. advertisement  eat to combat corona: staying one step ahead of the virus starts with your diet - bolstering your immune system and the healthy bacteria in your gut. let dr michael mosley show you the most delicious way to do it  by dr michael mosley for weekend  the diet that could save your life: his 5:2 and fast 800 diets have helped millions to lose weight. now, in his new book, dr michael mosley reveals how his revolutionary approach to eating can combat coronavirus  the worldwide covid-19 pandemic means life is going to be very different for all of us, with the spectre of infection and illness impacting everything we do. but i believe the best way to go forward without fear is to respect this deadly virus, follow all the guidance about social distancing and good old-fashioned hand washing.  we should take whatever steps we can to shore up our immune systems so we can be in the best possible position to resist its invasion and fight its effects.  until there are effective vaccines or treatments widely available, anyone who does come into contact with the virus is going to be heavily reliant on their immune system to keep covid-19’s destructive forces at bay.  dr michael mosley (pictured), who has penned a book offering advice on how to minimise your risk of complications if you contract covid-19, has shared a selection of healthy recipes that boost your immune system  but luckily, there’s plenty of good evidence to show that there are steps we can take to support our immune systems now and for the long term.  it’s nothing complex, painful or expensive. we just need to take heed of sensible evidence-based advice to shift excess weight, support our gut bacteria, reduce stress, be active and sleep well.  all of these have been shown in numerous studies to support your immune system, and i’m convinced that moving in this direction is one of the best ways to protect yourself against the ravages of the disease.  delay breakfast to bolster your immunity although a healthy breakfast is a great opportunity to boost your fruit and vegetable intake, you could speed your weight-loss success and also enhance your immune system by getting into a habit of intermittent fasting. studies show that stretching out the periods of time when your body doesn’t have to be involved with processing food gives it a chance to rest and repair, which is very useful for bolstering immunity. this also gives the lining of your gut, which takes a bashing during the day, more time to repair itself. it’s a bit like trying to repair a motorway; you can’t do it while cars are driving up and down in the day, so you have to wait till night-time and close it down. this process helps to reduce inflammation throughout the body (which is a sign of a malfunctioning immune system). you can choose one or both of these methods, which work well together: 5:2 – cut your calorie intake to 800 on two days a week, then eat healthily on the other five days.  tre or ‘time restricted eating’ – extend your natural night-time fast to 10-12 hours by eating within a restricted time window. many people find the easiest way for this is to delay or even skip breakfast.  today and all next week the daily mail is serialising my new book which is about covid-19, and i will be giving detailed, research-based advice about the most effective ways to avoid it and minimise your risk of complications if you do contract the virus.  the key is to ensure you are as healthy as you can be. that means keeping fit and, crucially, losing excess weight, since obesity and high blood sugar put extra pressure on the heart and lungs, which need to be strong to help when our immune system battles with the virus.  a healthy and active immune system is critical to fighting off the virus. which could explain why older people are so much more vulnerable than the young.  people like me, who are over 60, tend to have less efficient immune systems and, initially, may be slower to mount an adequate response. paradoxically, later in the illness an older immune system can be prone to overreact, creating a surge of aggressive immune cells that can damage the lungs and other organs.  so your immune system faces a tricky balancing act. it has to respond to threats, but not go too far.  however, it’s good to know there are lifestyle changes that can not only keep your immune system in good shape, but even turn back the clock – whatever your age. and the ideal way to effect good health fast is to address the way you eat.  start by emptying your fridge of tempting junk food and fill it with fresh fruit, vegetables, yoghurt and lean protein.  if you also stock up with pulses and wholegrains, you’ll soon be ready to pile your plate with a super-nourishing assortment of meals packed with natural disease-fighting nutrients.  the delicious recipes on these pages have been chosen from books written by me and my wife dr clare bailey to help keep your weight steady, feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, encourage restful sleep and have maximum impact on your health.  what’s so good about the mediterranean diet?  i am a huge fan of the mediterranean diet, which is rich in healthy natural fats, nuts and fish, as well as veggies and legumes, all packed with disease-fighting vitamins and minerals. it’s how my wife and i eat at home – and i love it! a mediterranean-style diet doesn’t just taste great.  stay away from processed food as well as eating to boost your immune system, it is important to avoid – if possible – habits which could be undermining your body’s ability to protect you. smoking is an obvious one, and insufficient sleep is another. but you might not realise that eating processed and junk food, and sticking to a narrow range of your favourite foods (the same sandwich for lunch every day, regular takeaways, and the same meals night after night) can undermine your immune system at a time when you most need it to be working on your behalf. our gut bacteria don’t respond well to the artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers and additives which are packed into highly processed food to make the cheap ingredients palatable. eating lots of sugary or processed foods will just reinforce and feed the ‘bad’, pro-inflammatory microbes that live in the gut and a healthy microbiome is crying out for variety. many families eat from a limited repertoire of set meals with a boringly small range of ingredients. the problem is, the more limited the range of foods you eat, the more limited your bacterial diversity is likely to be. there has never been a better time to experiment with new foods and recipes. it’s not just delicious – it’s the best way to bolster your immunity!  there is so much solid scientific evidence that shows adopting this lifestyle will cut your risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, depression and dementia – and it is also a key first step to boosting your protection against covid-19.  thanks to recent studies, we know it will improve your sleep and enhance the workings of your immune system.  one reason this diet is so beneficial is its ability to calm the potentially destructive inflammation process in the body. this is very good news because many experts now believe that chronic inflammation plays an important role in determining who is most badly affected by covid-19 and who escapes relatively unscathed.  the foods in this diet, such as olive oil, oily fish, legumes and vegetables, contain anti-inflammatory compounds, such as oleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols.  reducing chronic inflammation will not just reduce your risk of heart disease and cancer, but it also means you are less likely to suffer that dangerous overreaction by the immune system to covid-19 that leads to serious damage to vital organs and sometimes to death.  my low-ish carb mediterranean diet is also a great way to control your weight, which is particularly important right now. if you have a large waist then you are at much greater risk of becoming seriously ill.  why? it is partly because the more overweight you are, the lower your lung capacity. so if covid-19 attacks your lungs, you are more likely to end up in intensive care.  excess fat, particularly around the tummy, also increases chronic inflammation in your body, which in turn makes your immune response less efficient.  a large waist often goes hand in hand with raised blood sugar levels, and people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes (where blood sugars are raised but not yet in the diabetic range) tend to be more prone to infections and complications.  next week in the daily mail i’ll detail one of the best – and safest – ways to lose excess weight and reduce your diabetes risk fast, with my fast 800 plan (see thefast800.com). but even if you don’t have excess weight to lose, switching to a mediterranean diet can still bolster your immune defences.  what's the difference between prebiotic and probiotic? you can give your ‘good’ gut bacteria an extra boost by ensuring you eat lots of prebiotic and probiotic foods. a prebiotic is a special type of plant fibre (found in onions and leeks, asparagus, oats and bananas, for example), which your body struggles to digest but which acts like a fertiliser for your microbiome, encouraging the growth of ‘good’ bacteria in your gut. probiotics are the live bacteria or yeast that you can parachute into your intestines (via yoghurt, cheese, sauerkraut or supplements), in the hope that they will take root and do you some good.  these foods naturally boost levels of the ‘good’ bacteria in your gut. we know these microbes can produce powerful anti-inflammatory agents, as well as compounds which help reduce anxiety and which play an essential role in the body’s immune response.  studies have shown changing the mix of bacteria in your gut can reduce the number of coughs and colds you get, as well as the impact of allergenic and autoimmune diseases.  eating a wide range of different foods, which you will find in our recipes, will lead to a more diverse and resilient microbial gut community.  that is because you will be feeding them with the sorts of foods they love. by avoiding sugar and junk food you can starve out ‘bad’ bacteria, and by filling your plate with delicious vegetables, pulses and wholegrains you can create the best possible environment for ‘good’  breakfast  blueberry pancakes  this delicious blueberry pancake recipe is a healthy weekend treat that can be garnished with the

health,"doorknobs, handrails and shopping trolleys should be coated in copper to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to a top british scientist.  research has shown the deadly infection can survive and remain contagious on steel and plastic for three days.  but the coronavirus is killed off within four hours on copper because of the metal's antibacterial properties.  people can catch the illness by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face, allowing the virus to enter their mouth or nose.  william keevil, a senior microbiologist at the university of southampton, said the uk lagged behind other countries when it came to using copper in communal areas.  he suggested door handles, shopping trolleys, handrails on public transport, and even gym equipment should be coated in the metal.  doorknobs and handrails should be coated in copper to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to british scientists  workers on new york city's underground system disinfect frequently used surfaces in fulton center, such as turnstiles, metrocard vending machines and handrails  coronavirus spreads when somebody who already has it coughs or sneezes onto their hand, then touches something or someone.  anyone who touches something the patient has contaminated is at risk of catching the virus if they then touch their face.  warmer weather does not stop coronavirus spreading: two separate studies dash hopes of killer infection dying out in summer warm weather does not kill off the coronavirus or hamper its ability to spread, two separate studies have found. us and canadian researchers said the transmission risk was only reduced by about 1.5 per cent for every degree fahrenheit above 77f (25c). they analysed more than 370,000 cases in thousands of different cities in north america to come to the conclusion 'summer is not going to make this go away.' it dashes hopes of the global pandemic petering out in the coming months – a theory that has been touted by the us government. president donald trump said last month that research had suggested a combination of ultraviolet (uv) light and warmer temperatures killed off the virus in minutes. advertisement  william keevil, a senior microbiologist at the university of southampton, said the uk lagged behind other countries when it came to using copper in communal areas  the virus can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, but not through the skin.  when the coronavirus lands on copper, the metal's ions - electrically charged atoms - attack the virus' lipid membrane, the structure that protects it.  the copper then invades the cell and destroys the virus' dna, killing it off completely.  professor keevil told the times that buses in poland had already been fitted with copper-plated handrails, while airports in chile and brazil immigration kiosks were coated in the metal.  he said gyms in america – which are teeming with bacteria and other infectious germs - had even covered barbells and other equipment with copper.  'door handles, push pipes on doors and stair rails in public buildings, as well as bus and train grab rails, should all have copper elements introduced in the uk,' he told the newspaper.  professor keevil - who has been studying the antimicrobial effects of copper for more than two decades - said screens in fast-food restaurants and cash machines could also benefit from being fitted with the metal.  a us study last november found that copper hospital beds in intensive care units harbored an average of 95 per cent fewer bacteria than conventional hospital beds.  the medical university researchers, in south carolina, wrote at the time: 'the findings indicate that antimicrobial copper beds can assist infection control practitioners in their quest to keep healthcare surfaces hygienic between regular cleanings, thereby reducing the potential risk of transmitting bacteria associated with healthcare associated infections.'  studies have also shown coronavirus can be detected up to 24 hours after on cardboard.  similar results were obtained from tests they did on the virus that caused the 2003 sars outbreak.  health officials from around the world say stringent hand-washing protocols are crucial to stopping the virus's spread.  coronavirus lingers in the air of crowded spaces and rooms that lack ventilation, researchers find  covid-19 can linger in the air of crowded places, researchers today warned.  experts in wuhan, the chinese city where the pandemic began, analysed air samples from different parts of two hospitals.  results showed the virus, called sars-cov-2, was undetectable everywhere except two areas 'prone to crowding'.  researchers found viral particles floating in the air of hospital toilets, which had very little ventilation.  they also discovered especially high concentrations in the rooms where medical staff put on and took off protective gear.  the latter suggests the virus can latch onto clothing and become airborne again when when masks, gloves and gowns are removed.  passengers are pictured on a tube at canning town station on the london underground today  researchers behind the study say the findings highlight the importance of ventilation, limiting crowds and proper disinfection.  scientists around the world are scrambling to understand how the virus sheds and spreads.  there is debate about whether enough viral particles can survive in the air to infect people who breathe them in hours later.  the latest study, led by researchers at wuhan university, suggest it may be possible, without proper ventilation.  it follows a wealth of studies that have suggested the highly contagious disease does not just spread via droplets in a cough or sneeze.  ke lan, professor and director of the state key laboratory of virology at the university, and colleagues set up so-called aerosol traps in and around two hospitals in the city.  they could not find detectable levels of the virus in the corridors of wards and patients' rooms.  but they did discoverer them in toilets and two areas that had large crowds passing through, including an indoor space near one of the hospitals.  writing in the study, the scientists said: 'although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that sars-cov-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols.  'our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in aerosols.'  it comes on the back of a us study which hinted that coronavirus could spread through the air and remain contagious for hours.  the nebraska university paper found high levels of the bug lurking in the air in hospital rooms long after infected patients had left.  what's more is that traces of the coronavirus were also discovered in hospital corridors outside patients' rooms, where staff had been coming in and out.  the researchers behind the study say the finding highlights the importance of protective clothing for healthcare workers.  the researchers found viral particles in the air both inside the rooms and in the hallways outside of the rooms.  their finding suggests people may be able to contract the bug without ever being in direct close proximity to an infected person.  the study's authors said this highlights the importance of wearing personal protective equipment (ppe)."
health,"children with a rare, life-threatening inflammatory condition linked to coronavirus may be suffering from a pediatric version of the 'cytokine storm' blamed for the deaths of many adult patients, suggests a new study.  kids have largely been spared from severe covid-19 but they're not immune and, in april, a disturbing trend emerged: children were testing positive for the infection and had symptoms that most closely resembled kawasaki syndrome.  the syndrome is a rare pediatric condition marked by potentially life-threatening inflammation of blood vessels, usually preceded by a fever and skin rash.  doctors have been unsure what to make of the apparent link, but the connection was strong enough and the symptoms dangerous enough that, in the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) issued a warning about it to doctors.  now, doctors at mount sinai's icahn school of medicine have released one of the first detailed reports on phenomenon.  from their report on four such patients, it seems that children have a delayed onset of the 'cytokine' storm that can turn deadly, even after children have cleared coronavirus.  even though the patients tested negative for coronavirus, they showed signs of the dangerous inflammatory condition known as kawasaki syndrome, with one of the four showing progressively worse lung inflammation triggered by the virus - after he'd cleared it (pictured)  coronavirus's burden is undoubtedly heaviest upon older patients.  to-date, more than 16,000 people ages 24 and under have contracted coronavirus.  for most children, the infection is mild or even asymptomatic.  but at least 19 children 14 or younger have died, according to the cdc, plus another 93 between ages 15 and 24.  at least 100 american children have been diagnosed with the kawasaki-like condition alongside coronavirus, and the phenomenon has appeared in europe and the uk as well.  doctors are now referring to it as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome (pmis) and scrambling to work out how coronavirus might cause it and how to treat it.  four children - ages 15, 12, five and 10 - with symptoms that fit the bill for pmis showed up at mount sinai's emergency room between the end of april and beginning of may.  all four children came to the hospital with fevers that had lasted at least a day (all but one had had several days of fever) and rashes.  bobby dean, nine, was diagnosed with the rare inflammatory condition striking children who have had coronavirus. he spent six days in the hospital in rochester, new york  they also had some form of stomach upset - including diarrhea, pain and/or loss of appetite and either already had or developed potentially dangerous rapid heartbeats.  they all tested negative for current coronavirus infection but had positive antibody test results. one child had tested positive for coronavirus more than two weeks prior.  before admission, the kids were otherwise healthy, but ultimately wound up in the pediatric icu where they needed medical support for their lung function and levels of various blood proteins.  they had pmis and toxic shock syndrome and high levels of markers of inflammation in their blood.  in the study, published in the american journal of infectious medicine, the doctors said that the four children all had the same markers of a 'cytokine storm' - overrun inflammation triggered by an off-the-rails immune response - seen in adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus.  josie paskvan had a high fever on and off for a week, as well as a stomachache, red eyes, and cracked lips when she arrived at the hospital in texas. she is covid-positive and was diagnosed with the rare inflammatory illness, pmis, triggered by coronavirus  but four children at mt sinai had already cleared the infection and were admitted almost exactly a month after the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in new york city.  three of the four were, in fact, asymptomatic while they had active coronavirus infections. it was only later that they got severely ill.  doctors now suspect that the ace2 receptor found on the surface of lung, blood vessel and other cells, through which the coronavirus enters, is not yet fully developed, which may partially explain their generally mild infections.  another recent study proposed that children have low levels of an enzyme found in adults that actually helps the virus enter lung cells, meaning kids bodies do less to fuel the infection.  'it is possible that the mechanism of covid-19 post-infectious cytokine release syndrome in children is a post-infectious phenomenon related to an antibody complex mediated reaction,' the mt sinai researchers wrote.  the children deteriorated rapidly at various points, and some even had to be resuscitated.  the doctors gave all four children an immune system-suppressing drug, called tocilizumab - but it remains unclear if they recovered."
health,"hands up: who actually likes public speaking? i bet most people would rather stick pins in their eyes, but it’s something we all have to do at some point in our lives.  and this week we learned that not even senior members of the royal family — groomed from childhood, one would think, for life in the public eye — are immune to this fear.  it was refreshing to hear prince william speak so candidly about being racked by the same anxiety as the rest of us.  the prince (right) made his comments this week in a bbc documentary called football, prince william and our mental health, in which he travelled the country promoting his heads up initiative, which raises awareness about mental health and encourages footballers and fans to share their problems.  william said he overcame his anxiety when his eyesight started to deteriorate and he could no longer see clearly the faces in an audience or crowd staring at him.  ‘and it helps, because it’s just a blur of faces and because you can’t see anyone looking at you,’ he said.  fear of public speaking features prominently in our hierarchy of anxieties, alongside fear of spiders or heights.  i certainly suffered from it in the past. i’m now used to giving speeches and book readings, but there was a time when nerves floored me.  it was refreshing to hear prince william speak so candidly about being racked by the same anxiety as the rest of us  i’d have butterflies in my stomach, sweaty palms, and feel a sense of impending doom.  even now there are times when i find myself getting anxious before a public event — but i’ve learned a few tricks i’m happy to share with readers — and prince william.  making eye contact with a member of the audience can, as the prince found, be tricky. that’s because we cannot help but ‘read’ other people’s faces and this is a distraction.  instead, start off by looking at the back of the room. not only does it make you stand tall and appear confident, it also helps project your voice and stop you mumbling your words.  i’m sure you’ve heard the tip: imagine the audience naked. i understand the logic behind this — it’s about making your listeners seem as vulnerable as you are — but i wouldn’t recommend it.  instead, start from the premise that the audience is actually on your side — you just have to keep them there.  so never admit to nervousness, or apologise that you’re not used to this or don’t know what to say; this only makes them anxious for you.  furthermore, by saying it out loud, it reinforces in your mind that you are scared.  the best speeches relax the audience and make them warm to you. be optimistic. everyone in the room will be rooting for you.  i always ask the people at the back if they can hear me — it is polite and shows i am in control.  and don’t forget to breathe properly; take some deep breaths and control your breathing rate. smile — exude cheery confidence even if you don’t feel it! it makes all the difference.  if you’re on a stage, don’t pace up and down; unless you’re an accomplished speaker, it can appear nervy. and speak slowly.  there are always some people who think they can ‘wing it’. don’t be one of them. ‘fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ is a useful adage. rehearse with a friend or family member beforehand — or even in front of a mirror.  if your mind tends to go blank under pressure, write your speech on flash cards. (card is best because paper shakes when you’re nervous.)  most importantly, don’t forget to time yourself. always have a watch or timer in front of you (not on your wrist) that you can glance at.  being nervous is normal and the adrenaline can be used to boost your performance rather than wreck it — but only if you practise what i’m preaching.  keep your head up, smile and it will be over before you know it.  drmax@dailymail.co.uk  nothing excuses bullying by a mob  i’ve been appalled to see the disgraceful scenes outside dominic cummings’ london home this past week  i’ve been appalled to see the disgraceful scenes outside dominic cummings’ london home this past week.  many people are outraged because he drove 260 miles to his parents’ house in durham early on in lockdown, with his wife — who had coronavirus symptoms — and his son.  mr cummings claims exceptional circumstances allowed under the legislation and says he travelled to his parents’ house to be closer to childcare, should he and his wife become incapacitated by covid-19.  personally, i don’t think he broke the rules. as the deputy chief medical officer for england, dr jenny harries, explained a day after lockdown, ‘if you have adults who are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance.’  durham police, however, said if he had been stopped on that journey then he would have had to return home. with regards to his subsequent trip to barnard castle, the police said this was only a minor breach of the regulations and they will take no further action. that should be the end of the matter.  but whatever your view, the behaviour of the mob hurling abuse at him, screaming at his wife, and — presumably — terrifying their young son is simply unacceptable.  nothing gives people the right to behave like that — it shames our so-called civilised society.  kate says the story’s totally inaccurate anyway  petty rows avoid the real issues  according to society bible tatler, the alleged falling out between kate middleton and meghan markle centred on whether princess charlotte and the other little bridesmaids at meghan’s marriage to prince harry in may 2018 should wear tights or go bare-legged on a hot day.  it has been dubbed ‘tightsgate’ and, yes, it’s completely ridiculous — and kate says the story’s totally inaccurate anyway.  but — let’s admit it — so many rows start with a dispute over something really petty. i’ve heard the same thing from some of my patients. one woman would tell me about the huge arguments she had with her husband, because he wouldn’t do the washing up.  one day i said: ‘get a dishwasher!’ she thought about this, then responded: ‘but then we’d just row about something else.’  that said it all, really. their rows weren’t about the washing up at all. for some people, it’s easier to pick on something petty than tackle the underlying issue.  don't seal off books  while the pandemic has been scary, i am worried overzealous efforts to keep children safe could affect their mental wellbeing.  government adviser professor robert dingwall has raised concerns about the department for education’s plans for schools to remove soft toys and ‘seal off’ bookshelves, because of risks of infection. prof dingwall, who sits on an expert panel that feeds into sage (the scientific advisory group for emergencies), calls such moves ‘tragic’ and ‘misplaced’.  instead, he said schools should focus on handwashing and thorough cleaning of classrooms.  i couldn’t agree more. yes, it’s important to protect children, but books are essential for their education, just as toys are needed for their development. depriving them of either could be catastrophic for their overall psychological development.  many of us remember tony slattery as the quick-witted comic in the channel 4 series whose line is it anyway? before he disappeared from public life in the 1990s  dr max prescribes...  horizon: what's the matter with tony slattery?  many of us remember tony slattery as the quick-witted comic in the channel 4 series whose line is it anyway? before he disappeared from public life in the 1990s. as a documentary on bbc iplayer reveals, drink, drugs and mental health issues have blighted his life. it is a searingly honest account of the destructive force of addiction and mental illness. it was also, ultimately, a testament to the power of love. tony’s partner mark hutchinson’s unwavering support is probably what’s kept him going so long."
health,"coronavirus had already begun spreading in the us sometime between late january and early february - albeit in fits and starts - a new centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) analysis suggests.  the first identified case of coronavirus in the us was confirmed on january 21, in a 35-year-old man who had traveled to wuhan, china, where the coronavirus pandemic originated.  but soon, cases began cropping up in various other places in the us, among people who had neither had contact with that man, nor traveled to china. on february 27, the cdc announced what they believed was the first case of community spread.  now, the agency has pooled together the results of coronavirus tests run on nasal mucus samples collected before american health officials knew coronavirus had arrived in the us and established a new timeline of its spread.  there was no significant increase in flu- or covid-like illness in early february before the first known cases of community spread were identified in counties in washington and california (pictured), but the deaths of people in california in early february suggest it was already here  once the world health organization announced, on january 14, that coronavirus was spreading from person-to-person in china, it became likely that it would only be a matter of time before it made its way with travelers to other parts of the world.  it took less than a week for the cdc to confirm that that had happened.  but at that point, there was still hope - even widespread belief - that the virus could be contained to travelers and perhaps their close contacts.  it took just over a month for that hope to be dashed, when a california resident with no recent history of travel to china was confirmed to have coronavirus.  confirmation of that first case of so-called 'community spread' was a hair-raising moment: there was no telling how this person contracted the disease, or how many others had also already been infected.  two days later, another non-travel infection confirmed, this one in washington (but not tied to the first identified patient).  further east, coronavirus-like illnesses didn't start ticking upward until march in counties in michigan, illinois, massachusetts and louisiana (pictured)  local health departments keep tabs on flu activity be collecting samples and keeping from people who get tested for flu and sharing the results with the cdc.  after coronavirus spread was detected in the us, these archived samples were also tested for the new virus.  cdc's analysis of flu-surveillance networks didn't show any notable increase in cases of flu-like illness - of which coronavirus is now considered one - before that date, february 28.  but the new analysis also includes testing performed on the bodies of people who died in late january and february of suspiciously covid-19-like symptoms.  two deceased people who had not travelled internationally in the weeks before their deaths tested positive for coronavirus: two unaffiliated residents of a california county who died on february 6 and 17, respectively.  new york has been hit hardest by coronavirus, and many experts now believe the virus was in new york city by january or february, but its spread was subtle, and didn't trigger noticeable increases in similar illnesses until early march, the cdc's graph shows  health officials also later identified a person who left san francisco on a cruise ship on february 11.  taken together this group of cases 'confirms cryptic circulation of the virus by early february,' the cdc officials write.  based on these testing data and genetic analysis of samples of the virus, the cdc now believes that the virus started spreading in the us after a 'single importation' from china, occurring before the first cases were identified.  after that point, they theorize that more people arriving from europe brought additional strains to the us, where they spread - an hypothesis that is consistent with other genetic analyses suggesting that the virus arrived in new york from europe."
health,"advertisement  britons appear to be less scared of coronavirus than they have been in months as figures show nine out of 10 adults ventured out of their homes last week.  office for national statistics data revealed that, between may 21 and may 24, 90 per cent of people left their homes, up from 86 per cent the week before.  as lockdown rules continue to loosen and the weather heats up, more and more people are venturing outside after weeks confined to their own homes except for essential trips.  officials warn the elderly and people with long-term health problems should still be 'shielding' themselves at home to avoid catching the virus.  but prime minister boris johnson has announced that, from monday, most people will be permitted to meet in groups of up to six people as long as they stay outdoors and maintain social distancing.  the number of people who said they feel unsafe when they go outside has fallen dramatically from 41 per cent to just 29 per cent in a week.  almost eight in 10 said they were confident they had enough information about how to protect themselves from covid-19 - despite no proven treatment or vaccine in place.  but the overwhelming majority of britons were still cautious about putting vulnerable people at risk, with 88 per cent of people saying they avoided contact with the elderly.  almost everyone (98 per cent) claimed they are trying their best to keep a two-metre distance when they were out and about.  thirty per cent of adults are now wearing masks in public, despite the government not fully endorsing their use amid concerns they give people false confidence.  the most common reasons for going out continue to be for shopping, exercise, work and medical needs.  but leisurely trips are on the rise - 42 per cent of people said they had been to a park or green space in the last week and 36 per cent met friends or family while out.  over half of adults (55 per cent) said they were now open to the idea of meeting with someone outside of their household, as long as it was outdoors.  the ons survey was carried out on 1,028 adults from across great britain who were questioned between may 21 and may 24.  the survey also found:  almost a third (29 per cent) of adults said they had used masks or face coverings within the past week;  two thirds of adults are still worried about covid-19 affecting their life - but this dropped from 85 per cent at the peak of the outbreak  as the lockdown drags on, loneliness has become more common at the end of may than at any other point since march;  73 per cent of people are still following the strict lockdown rules and leaving home only to exercise, go shopping or to work;  nine out of 10 people (88.3 per cent) are still in favour of lockdown and support the government's rules. 5.8 per cent had no strong feeling, while 5.2 per cent oppose them;  three quarters of people have seen their household income fall because of the coronavirus;  people are becoming more optimistic about when life will return to normal, with 44 per cent thinking it will last six months or more, compared to 48 per cent last week.  the biggest takeaway from the ons data was that people seem to be getting more relaxed about the lockdown rules and the effect covid-19 is having on their lives.  this lines up with positive messages emerging from the government - that the numbers of new cases and deaths are continuing to trend downwards, and that it is time to start returning to a semblance of normality.  boris johnson confirmed yesterday that schools and some shops will be allowed to reopen next week, and people will be able to meet up in groups outdoors.  more high street businesses are expected to be able to reopen in two weeks' time, provided there are no signs of the virus bouncing back.  the ons report said: 'the proportion of people that said they had either not left their home or only left for the four main reasons that were permitted through the lockdown period is at its lowest level of 73 per cent.  'this compares with 81 per cent last week and a peak of 85 per cent between 3 to 13 april.  'the largest increase in other reasons for leaving the home, is for people meeting others outside their household in a public place.'  it added: 'across great britain, just under three in 10 adults (29 per cent) said they felt unsafe or very unsafe when outside of their home which has decreased from 41 per cent last week.  'at the time of the survey, lockdown restrictions had started to change in england.  'for those living in england, feelings of safety varied for different activities outside of the home.  'while over half of adults (55 per cent) felt safe when meeting with someone outside of their household outdoors, this fell to around one in three who felt safe when visiting shops (37 per cent).'  the survey data, which quizzes britons about how the coronavirus and lockdown is affecting their lives, comes after boris johnson last night announced a further loosening of the rules would start on monday.  he confirmed that primary schools would be permitted to open to some students and some outdoor retailers - such as car showrooms - can start to reopen. more shops are expected to return to business later in june.  people will also be able to meet up in groups of six friends or family, as long as they stay outside and stay 2m (6'6"") apart from anyone who doesn't live in their home.  after two months of stringent restrictions, long-awaited changes will mean many grandparents can see their children and grandchildren for the first time in two months – while groups of friends or family members can gather for a summer barbecue.  but members of different households will be told to stay two metres apart, they will not be allowed to hug and they won't be allowed to stay over.  the prime minister said the measures would provide a 'long-awaited and joyful moment' for many as they were reunited with their loved ones.  mr johnson said all five tests required to move to the next phase of the lockdown had been met, adding: 'that is not my achievement or the government's achievement – it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus.'  an upbeat pm revealed yesterday that the draconian restrictions are being eased slightly from next week, as he formally reduced the country's covid 'alert' status from four to three.  despite warnings from chief scientific adviser patrick vallance that 8,000 new infections are still happening every day and admitting making the rules more nuanced will create 'anomalies and inconsistencies', mr johnson unveiled a series of changes to take effect in england from monday.  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix. they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned.  non-essential shops and primary schools will start to reopen from next month, as had been suggested earlier in the week.  mr johnson told the daily downing street briefing: 'i cannot and i will not throw away all the gains we have made together. so the changes that we have made are limited and cautious.'  the premier said there was no question of people being given permission to stay overnight, or spend time in other homes. however, he added: 'we want people to be able to see their friends and family. we want people to be able to see both parents at once.  'you could even have a barbecue provided you did it in a socially distanced way.'  chief medical officer chris whitty confirmed that people can go to the toilet in other people's houses if they come to visit, but it was 'absolutely critical' that they wiped everything down afterwards and washed their hands rigorously.  the bigger than expected move comes despite concerns having been raised in cabinet that a 'barbecue clause' could lead to a fresh flare-up in infections."
health,"advertisement  britain today announced 324 more covid-19 deaths, taking the official number of coronavirus victims past 38,000 as separate data shows the true number of fatalities is at least 10,000 higher.  chancellor rishi sunak announced the figure tonight at downing street's daily press conference, where he also revealed 2,095 more britons had been diagnosed with the virus, taking the country's total cases past 270,000.  health chiefs yesterday announced 377 covid-19 fatalities in all settings - bringing the average daily death toll over the last week to 252, down from the record high of 943 recorded during the peak of the crisis in mid-april. for comparison, 351 deaths were announced last friday.  number 10's top scientific adviser sir patrick vallance also warned britain's crucial r-rate - the number of people an infected patient will pass the virus on to - is still close to one, the point where it could spiral back out of control.  mailonline today published an interactive module that allows you to find out exactly how many people have died of covid-19 in your area, based on government data. birmingham is the local authority with the most fatalities in england and wales (1,047). the isles of scilly off the coast of cornwall is the only place to have had no deaths.  it came after a separate analysis of office for national statistics (ons) data revealed 18 local authorities in england and wales, such as north somerset, kettering, preston, wrexham and carlisle, have yet to suffer their darkest days of the crisis - despite the national crisis having slowed significantly.  in other coronavirus developments today:  boris johnson sparked confusion again after number 10 admitted coronavirus threat level has not been reduced despite the prime minister's decision to ease lockdown from monday;  a government adviser said halving the two-metre social distancing rule will have no significant impact on risk of spreading coronavirus as ministers say pubs with gardens could reopen in july;  the bbc has launched an official probe into emily maitlis' rant about dominic cummings after receiving 20,000 complaints, with the corporation accusing her of 'overstepping the mark';  people identified as having been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus will not be told who has named them when they are asked to self-isolate for two weeks, it was revealed;  firms must pay 20 per cent of wages for furloughed staff from august, rishi sunak is expected to say as he starts to wind down the government's massive coronavirus bailouts.  nhs england chiefs today recorded 149 more coronavirus deaths in hospitals, while scotland posted 15, wales 10 and northern ireland three across all settings, including care homes.  the remaining deaths are thought to have occurred in care homes in england - where the crisis is still raging on - and in the wider community. it means the official number of victims uk-wide is now 38,161.  separate figures published today showed the number of covid-19 deaths in the uk has passed 48,000 - which is 27 per cent higher than the official tally given by the department of health.  dh only counts victims who have tested positive for the virus, whereas the statistical bodies that analyse data in england, scotland, wales and northern ireland all include suspected deaths in weekly tallies.  but other models suggest the true number of fatalities caused by coronavirus is in the region of 60,000, when 'excess deaths' - how many more people have died than on average - are taken into account.  ministers admit 'excess deaths' are the most reliable measure of how many fatalities the coronavirus has actually contributed to. they include people who have died because of indirect effects of the outbreak.  data published by the northern ireland statistics and research agency today showed 716 deaths involving covid-19 had occurred across the country up to may 22.  the latest figures from the national records of scotland, published on wednesday, showed 3,779 deaths involving covid-19 had been registered in scotland up to may 24.  and the latest figures from the ons, published on tuesday, showed 42,173 deaths involving covid-19 occurred in england and wales up to may 15.  together these figures mean, so far, 46,668 deaths have occurred in the uk where the coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate.  a further 1,408 hospital patients in england who had tested positive for covid-19 died between may 16 and may 27, according to figures published on thursday by nhs england.  it means, together with the total figure of 46,668 registered deaths, indicates the overall death toll for the uk is now just over 48,000.  despite the rising death toll, boris johnson yesterday set out a significant loosening of restrictions which will enable up to half a dozen people from different households to mix outside and in gardens from june 1, as primary schools reopen and non-essential shops prepare to follow suit.  the four home nations now have significantly different sets of lockdown rules in place. for example, in england from monday six people can meet up outdoors but in scotland from today it is eight people  but scientists are becoming increasingly outspoken over the government's approach as they warn ministers that the pandemic is far from over.  it came as mr johnson faced questions over his decision to ease lockdown as it emerged that the government has not lowered its coronavirus alert level.  despite the pm saying the government's five tests have been met and it is safe to start relaxing restrictions, no10 confirmed today that the alert level remains at four.  mr johnson suggested to mps on wednesday that the alert was 'coming down' from four to three and he was 'hoping' a decision would be taken yesterday.  ministers have insisted throughout that the lockdown would only be eased when the five tests were met. however, the government has also set up the covid alert system which describes what people can expect to happen at each level. level four requires 'current social distancing measures and restrictions'.  no10 insisted the government's steps for england were taken on the basis of the five tests, and the joint biosecurity centre is in charge of the alert level. however, it is understood no announcement is expected today, and sources declined to say whether one would come before monday.  there was no alert status slide used at the daily downing street briefing last night, and mr johnson did not refer to the level. labour said ministers urgently need to explain how the lifting of restrictions fits with the alert system.  how many people have died of covid-19 in your area? birmingham has had more than 1,000 coronavirus fatalities – as analysis shows 18 areas in england and wales have yet to see a peak in deaths  government data has revealed an area-by-area breakdown of where the most and fewest people have died of the coronavirus since the outbreak began.  birmingham is the local authority with the most covid-19 fatalities in england and wales, and the only one to have recorded more than 1,000 victims (1,047).  meanwhile, leeds, durham and liverpool have all recorded more than 500 deaths each since the beginning of the pandemic - 574, 516 and 509, respectively.  only one local authority has recorded no deaths at all - the isles of scilly off the coast of cornwall, which are home to just 2,000 people.  office for national statistics (ons) data has set out the areas where the most and fewest people have been killed by the virus by may 15, when the total for england and wales was 41,047.  while the national outbreak is believed to be past its peak, there are 18 areas where covid-19 fatalities still appear to be on the rise.  local authorities including north somerset, kettering preston, doncaster, wrexham and carlisle, have yet to suffer their darkest days of the crisis, according to a separate analysis of the ons data.  north somerset recorded 24 coronavirus deaths in that week - up from 16 in the seven-day spell before. the area includes weston general hospital, which dramatically shut its doors to new patients on monday following a spike in coronavirus patients.  it comes after health secretary matt hancock confirmed earlier this week that 'local lockdowns' could be imposed on whole towns if there are regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases.  eighteen councils in britain have not yet seen their coronavirus death peak and many saw more people die in the week from may 9 to may 15 than at any other point in the outbreak so far. one of them was north somerset, where weston-super-mare had to close its hospital because of a rampant spread of the disease  most of the deaths recorded in the ons's figures happened in hospitals - 26,679 - with the most hospital deaths occurring in birmingham, where there were 784.  this was followed by the london borough of brent, with 368.  meanwhile 11,632 people died in care homes in england and wales, the biggest proportion of which was the 243 residents who died in county durham.  the most recent data published by the office for national statistics (ons) shows that 18 local authorities recorded their highest weekly death toll in the seven-day spell that ended may 15.  in doncaster the number of people dying of the coronavirus has remained relatively stable for the past six weeks and had not started to drop by may 15.  a total of 31 people died in that week, from may 9 to may 15, which was the same as the tally counted a fortnight earlier - and the joint highest so far.  the week before had suggested a drop, with the figure falling from 31 to 18, but it bounced back again showing the area is still battling the virus.  at least half a dozen areas showed the same pattern - a one week drop in fatalities followed by a resurgence - which may have been a result of the ve day bank holiday on may 8. statisticians warned that deaths do not get registered properly on bank holidays and the statistics for the weeks surrounding them may be inaccurate.  in a data release the ons said: 'the early may bank holiday contributed to both the decrease in the number of deaths registered in week 19 and the increase in the number of deaths registered in week 20, as deaths were unlikely to be registered on friday 8 may.  the 10 areas with the most amount of covid-19 deaths 1. birmingham 2. leeds 3. county durham 4. liverpool 5. brent 6. sheffield 7. aneurin bevan uhb 8. croydon 9. barnet 10. cardiff and vale uhb ons figures up to may 15 1,047 574 516 509 457 450 444 441 432 400 advertisement  the 10 areas with the fewest amount of covid-19 deaths 1. isles of scilly 2. city of london 3. ceredigion 4. hastings 5. rutland 6. south hams 7. mid devon 8. west devon 9. norwich 10. west lindsey 10. isle of anglesey 0 4 6 7 11 12 15 15 15 16 16  'next week's report will allow a better assessment of recent trends in the number of all-cause deaths and deaths related to covid.'  ashford in kent saw its weekly death toll drop from 14 to eight and then back up to 19 for the week ending may 15 -

as it emerged twice as many staff have the virus than patients.  boris johnson used weston hospital as an instance where the government 'moved very quickly to close things down there to try to sort it out'.  he added: 'that is the kind of whack-a-mole tactics that we are going to use as we keep driving the virus down and keep reducing the incidents.'  the hospital in weston-super-mare, somerset, is believed to have 135 members of staff infected compared to 64 patients.  those workers were among the 2,013 people who tested positive for the virus on wednesday and who were contacted as part of the test and trace system rolled out across england and scotland this morning.  the scheme is designed to find anyone who has come into contact with an infected person so they can be told to isolate for 14-days even if they are not sick.  weston general shut its doors on monday and is unlikely to admit any new patients for at least another week while it deals with the current outbreak. all members of staff are currently undergoing testing for covid-19 which is set to be completed by the weekend.  speaking to the bbc, robert woolley, chief executive of university hospitals bristol and weston nhs foundation trusts said an investigation was under way to find out the cause of the spike in staff infections.  he said: 'the question is, have we had patients bringing the infection into hospital when they arrive and staff are getting infected that way?  'or are staff coming in from the community infected and infecting themselves and possibly others? we just don't know.  'it's very complex and we need help from other agencies to know what the position is in greater weston.'  a number of factors behind the spike are being considered, including claims that emerged today of hospital staff not being routinely informed by managers when their colleagues tested positive for the virus - even those who had previously shown no symptoms.  but north somerset is not alone in terms of high coronavirus deaths.  those areas yet to see their peak include ashford, kent; broadland, norfolk; carlisle, cumbria; doncaster, south yorkshire; eden, cumbria; fenland, cambridgeshire; herefordshire; hinckley and bosworth, leicestershire; kettering, northamptonshire; and north somerset.  other areas are preston, lancashire; richmondshire, north yorkshire; rother, east sussex; selby, north yorkshire; south norfolk; tonbridge and malling, kent; wrexham, north wales; and wyre, lancashire.  it comes as the prime minister tonight gave the green light to the first limited socialising since lockdown, revealing that up to six people can now meet outdoors and in private gardens for barbecues - as long as they stay six feet away from each other.  mr johnson revealed that the restrictions are being eased slightly from next week, as he formally reduced the country's covid 'alert' status from four to three.  despite warnings from chief scientific adviser patrick vallance that 8,000 new infections are still happening every day and admitting making the rules more nuanced will create 'anomalies and inconsistencies', mr johnson unveiled a series of changes to take effect in england from monday.  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends - although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules. they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned.  non-essential shops and primary schools will start to reopen from next month, as had been suggested earlier in the week.  mr johnson told the daily downing street briefing: 'i cannot and i will not throw away all the gains we have made together. so the changes that we have made are limited and cautious.'  it comes after britons were last night warned not to get carried away with news that lockdown is loosening because the virus' r-rate is still dangerously close to 1.  the government's top scientific adviser sir patrick vallance revealed the current r-rate is between 0.7 and 0.9, and while coronavirus case numbers were declining, they are 'not coming down fast' in a downbeat update at tonight's downing street press conference.  the reproduction rate denotes the number of other people an infected patient will pass the sickness on to and it must stay at 1 or below or britain will face another crisis. however, the way the r is calculated means it is out of date, and the latest calculation is based on data from around three weeks ago - before the lockdown loosened.  'the current value is somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, so it remains close to one. it may very close to one in some areas,' said sir patrick. 'the numbers are coming down at the moment, but they are not coming down fast.'  the number of people dying in april each year has remained relative stable at around 40,000 or the last 13 years, but saw a massive spike to 88,000 this year as the coronavirus epidemic raged through the uk"
health,"new brain scans of a coronavirus patient reveal how the virus can change the organ and deprive people of their sense of smell.  the italian researchers believe their study is the first to show images of these brain changes in a living human patient.  loss of smell is the most common of a handful of neurological symptoms that doctors now believe are caused by coronavirus. previous studies have suggested that up to 65 percent of people infected lose their sense of smell.  but the new study is the first to show through medical imaging that the odd symptom is not just a result of the virus's travel through our airways, but evidence of the virus's attacks on the brain.  mri scans of the woman's brain showed that areas involved in sense of smell (indicated by arrows) were more vividly white, due to coronavirus's inflammatory attacks  the images show slight fluctuations in a area of the brain that controls our olfactory sense.  to an untrained eye, they might be too subtle to see, but to the medical experts from irccs istituto clinico humanitas and humanitas university in milan, italy, and boston children's in the us, the aberrations were clear.  images were taken of a 25-year-old radiographer.  she was otherwise healthy, until she had to start working in a ward of her hospital caring for coronavirus patients.  for a single day, the health care worker had a dry cough, but by the next day it was gone.  but she couldn't smell anything, and everything she ate or drank tasted off. the two sensory symptoms persisted, even though she never developed a fever and felt mostly okay.  exams of her nose and chest seemed normal three days after her sense of smell vanished, so doctors performed an mri of the woman's brain, too.  coronavirus can attack types of human cells that have ace receptors on their surfaces. various parts of the brain have these receptors, making them vulnerable to infection  they found changes to her brain in two areas: a region called the right gyrus rectus and in the olfactory bulbs.  olfactory bulbs take in sensory information from the nose and pass them on to other regions, including the gyrus rectus, for processing.  the way that these changes appeared in the mri were was consistent with the kind of images the doctors would expect to see from viral attacks on the organ, so they tested the woman for coronavirus.  her test was positive.  after 28 days, the doctors did another mri, and could see that her brain was starting to return to normal, although the olfactory bulbs remained slightly inflamed.  when doctors took a second set of scans 28 days later, the inflammation had begun to subside, and her gyrus rectus and olfactory bulbs were not longer as vividly white in mris  eventually, the woman's sense of smell returned and no long-term damage was seen.  oddly, the doctors took mris of two other patients with coronavirus and loss of smell but did not see the ame brain changes in them.  however, the alterations to the woman's brain were consistent with those noted in previous autopsies and animal studies - hers was just the first living human brain in which the at doctors observed the virus's attacks.  'based on the mri findings, including the slight olfactory bulb changes, we can speculate that sars-cov-2 might invade the brain through the olfactory pathway and cause an olfactory dysfunction,' the study authors wrote.  what's more, the fact that the woman really developed other signs of coronavirus - like fever, fatigue or persistent cough - told the doctors that loss of smell can be not only a symptom, but the primary symptom of the virus."
health,"on monday, the world health organization (who) announced it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its trial over safety concerns (file image)  more than 120 leading scientists and doctors from around the world have criticised a hydroxychloroquine study that halted global trials of the anti-malaria drug.  the experts have penned an open letter to the editor of the lancet, the medical journal in which the study was published, raising serious concerns about its methods.  they have highlighted 10 major flaws, including patient data which they say does not match with public health records.  the letter's signatories include prominent imperial college london epidemiologist professor neil ferguson, whose stark warning that 250,000 brits could die without action played a role in the uk triggering lockdown in march. he also made headlines this month after flouting the same lockdown rules to have secret trysts with his married mistress.  us and swiss scientists behind the lancet study, published last friday, found hydroxychloroquine raised the risk of death and heart issues in covid-19 patients.  their finding prompted the uk’s drugs watchdog to temporarily suspend two major oxford university clinical trials of the antimalarial.  the world health organization also pulled the plug on its solidarity study, on the back of the worrying results.  the large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 covid sufferers who received hydroxychloroquine or another form of the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics.  the team's modelling is considered the gold standard by the government and its decisions throughout the epidemic have been heavily influenced by the london epidemiologists. it was thrust into spotlight when professor neil ferguson (pictured) flouted lockdown rules  it then compared this data with the hospital records of 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug - and claimed the data came from six continents.  the signatories of the letter said the study did not mention the countries or hospitals that contributed to the data source, meaning they cannot be fact checked.  why is hydroxy-chloroquine controversial? hydroxychloroquine - branded as plaquenil - is a cheap drug that has been used to prevent malaria and treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis for decades. but no evidence currently exists to show the drug can prevent patients being struck down with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. scientists also warn there is no proof hydroxychloroquine, which was touted as a wonder drug by donald trump, can even treat covid-19. hope was sparked early on in the crisis when a french study suggested the drug could have both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. it triggered a flurry of research across the world, an endorsement from trump and emergency authorization from us regulators. but other research has dealt a blow to the drug, with one chinese trial last month finding it did not speed up the recovery of covid-19 patients. and new york researchers last week said patients got no benefits whether they took just the drug or paired it with the antibiotic azithromycin. leading doctors have warned the drug can cause severe side effects, and can even throw off the process that makes the heart beat in time. one trial in brazil was stopped short because so many of the enrolled coronavirus patients given the drug developed these arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats). according to webmd, side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, or headache  slow heartbeat, symptoms of heart failure (such as shortness of breath, swelling ankles/feet, unusual tiredness, unusual/sudden weight gain)  mental/mood changes (such as anxiety, depression, rare thoughts of suicide, hallucinations)  hearing changes (such as ringing in the ears, hearing loss), easy bruising/bleeding  signs of infection or liver disease  muscle weakness, unwanted/uncontrolled movements (including tongue/face twitching), hair loss, hair/skin color changes  low blood sugar, severe dizziness, fainting, fast/irregular heartbeat, seizures. advertisement  in the letter they write: 'the authors have not adhered to standard practices in the machine learning and statistics community. they have not released their code or data.  'there was no ethics review... there was no mention of the countries or hospitals that contributed to the data source and no acknowledgments to their contributions.  'a request to the authors for information on the contributing centres was denied. data from australia are not compatible with government reports.  'surgisphere [the company that manages the database of patients used to inform the study] have since stated this was an error of classification of one hospital from asia. this indicates the need for further error checking throughout the database.'  the letter, first seen by the guardian, also states that data from africa claims nearly a quarter of covid-19 patients and 40 per cent of all deaths on the continent happened in hospitals where surgisphere operates.  the experts say this is 'unlikely' to be true. they are now calling the study's findings a false alarm and are urging clinical trials around the world to get back up and running.  surgisphere has since issued a public statement defending its study, claiming it was 'carefully performed'. but it admitted its results should not be 'over-interpreted'.  hydroxychloroquine has been earmarked as one of the most promising existing drugs in the fight against coronavirus.  laboratory studies showed it could prevent the disease from replicating in vitro, but the effect in humans is unclear.  president trump was among the first to wax lyrical about the possible benefits for coronavirus patients in march.  then this month he revealed he'd been taking the malaria drug for a week-and-a-half to stave off the virus - despite no evidence showing it worked in this way.  three oxford university-led human trials of the drug are underway to test its effect on a range of patients with the viral disease.  more than 10,500 nhs patients with moderate to severe covid are taking part in the recovery trial at hundreds of hospitals around the uk.  copcov is an international study investigating whether the malaria tablets can prevent coronavirus infection in the first place.  and the principle trial is looking at hydroxychloroquine's effect on elderly covid patients - who are most at risk of dying from the disease.  recruitment for the copcov and principle trials have been temporarily suspended on the back of the study in the lancet.  the researchers behind these studies say they fully expect them to be back up and running in the coming weeks.  the truth about hydroxychloroquine: cheap malaria drug being trialled to treat covid-19 has sparked hopes - but evidence shows it may not help after all and can even cause severe heart problems  infected patients 'get no benefit from taking hydroxychloroquine'  researchers funded by the national institutes of health looked at data from 1,438 covid-19 patients across 25 hospitals in new york.  the study, published in jama last month, was observational and looked at the outcomes of patients given different drug combinations.  about 25 per cent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin - another promising coronavirus drug - died.  in comparison, the rate was 20 per cent for those only given hydroxychloroquine alone and was 10 per cent for those on azithromycin.  90% of critical patients given the drug developed arrhythmias  scientists in the us and france last month found 90 per cent of critically-ill covid-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine developed heart arrhythmias.  an arrhytmia is an abnormal heartbeat rhythm, which could be that the heart beats too slow, too fast or irregularly.  it is relatively common, affecting around two million people per year in the uk, but can increase the risk of life-threatening events such as stroke or cardiac arrest.  massachusetts general hospital researchers monitored 90 patients in intensive care units, while university of lyon academics analysed 40 patients.  both uncovered similar results in jama cardiology, after looking at the qt intervals - the time between the heart's ventricular muscles contracting and then relaxing.  when this interval becomes too long, the patient has developed a dangerous form of heart arrhythmia, called atrial fibrillation.  hydroxychloroquine may impair ability of immune systems  hydroxychlorouquine may impair the ability of patients' immune systems to fight off the infection, a review suggested at the start of april.  harvard scientists analysed 10 studies as well as anecdotal reports from doctors that suggested the drug could help coronavirus patient.  the review found many of the clinical trials were poorly conducted and anecdotal reports carried little weight.  hydroxychloroquine does not speed up recovery  the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine did not speed up coronavirus patients' recovery in a trial in china, scientists revealed in april.  in a disappointing blow for the promising drug, doctors said it did not work as a cure.  patients who were taking it suffered fewer symptoms than others who were treated alongside them without the medication but their recovery time was the same.  they had tested hydroxychloroquine on 75 covid-19 patients in hospitals and compared their illnesses to 75 patients who didn't receive the drug.  brazil trial stopped early because of heart problems  a clinical trial in brazil had to be stopped early, it was revealed last month, because patients developed heart problems.  the brazilian study, taking place in the amazonian city of manaus, had planned to enroll 440 severely ill covid-19 patients to test two doses of chloroquine.  but researchers reported their results and called a halt to the experiment after only 81 people had received the high-dose treatment which gave them 1,200mg per day.  one in four of the patients had developed heart rhythm problems and early data suggested death rates were higher among those patients.  malaria drug does improve survival odds, physicians claim  hydroxychloroquine has improved the survival and recovery odds for about 90 per cent of patients treated, a physicians group claimed.  the association of american physicians and surgeons (aaps) presented data on 2,333 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine.  results showed 91.6 per cent of those who got the controversial drug fared better after treatment, it was reported at the end of april.  combining drug with diet supplement could work better  combining hydroxychloroquine with the dietary supplement zinc could create a more effective treatment for coronavirus patients, a study suggested last week.  researchers found taking the drugs together, along with the antibiotic azithromycin, increased patient's chances of being discharged and decreased their risk of dying.  it did not, however, change the average time patients spent in hospital, how long they spent on a ventilator or the total amount of oxygen required.  the team, from new york university grossman school of medicine, says the findings are encouraging but that more studies are needed.  hydroxychloroquine could help treat patients, study says  french researchers last month found hydroxychloroquine could treat coronavirus patients, sparking hope of a cure.  thirty patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine for 10 days, combined with azithromycin, an antibiotic.  although very small, the study 'showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage' after the six days.  and results showed patients had a 'much lower average carrying duration' compared to patients who received other treatments.  several weeks later, the study's publisher said the paper 'did not meet its standards' because it excluded data on patients who did not respond well to the treatment."
health,"shocking new graphics show that the novel coronavirus is still surging in several counties across the us.  as states begin to reopen their economies, several cities have been seeing their daily covid-19 infections increase.  daily infections in harrison, texas - a state that has been aggressively reopening - have spiked by 900 percent since mid-april.  and in milwaukee, wisconsin, where stay-at-home orders were deemed 'unconstitutional' by the state supreme court, cases have increased by 360 percent since early april.  researchers from the university of washington school of pharmacy found there also between between 350,000 and 1.2 million coronavirus deaths in the us, making the virus far deadlier than the seasonal flu.  last week marked the first time all 50 states at least partially reopened as restrictions on businesses and social distancing were seen in varying degrees across the country.  harrison, texas has seen daily cases increase from about 300 per 100,000 people in mid- april to 3,000 per 100,000 on may 22 - a 900 percent increase  daily infections jumped in clay county, florida from 160 per 100,000 on april 1 to 800 on may 22, which is a 400 percent spike  the new research comes as last week marked the first time all 50 states at least partially reopened as restrictions on businesses and social distancing were seen in varying degrees across the country  'although it wouldn't beat an actual study doing [antibody] testing in the community, we know that's difficult to come by what we tried to give an idea of how widespread this is,' dr anirban basu, director of the choice institute at the uw school of pharmacy, told dailymail.com.  'hopefully that will give some idea at a county level, a local level, or people who are using modeling to forecast the future, to understand what's going in the community.  for the study, the team created a model that looked at infection and fatality rates from 116 counties in 33 states.  basu said the tool is not a forecasting program, but rather looks at how cases are changing daily in the us.  the model showed that, in harrison, texas, cases humped from about 300 per 100,000 people in mid- april to 3,000 per 100,000 on may 22.  that's a 900 percent jump over the course of about a month.  texas, which currently has more than 55,000 cases and more than 1,500 deaths, has allowed retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls to reopen at 25 percent capacity.  in some parts of the state, the establishments can open at 50 percent capacity.  and in clay county, florida - about 33 miles from jacksonville - daily infections have risen from 160 per day on april 1 to 800 on may 22.  a nursing home in the county, governors creek health and rehabilitation, recently recored seven deaths from the coronavirus outbreak.  according to the florida-times union, the death toll is the highest in the jacksonville metropolitan area.  florida, which has more than 52,000 infections and more than 2,200 deaths, has lifted restrictions by allowing retail stores, restaurants, gyms and personal care services to reopen at limited capacity.  in both states, residents have packed bars and restaurants - even as local officials called for people to remember social distancing measures.  'if we really see that the total symptomatic cases are on the rise in the community, we should be a little bit more prudent about opening up the economy right away rather than in a county where we've seen there's been consistent decline for a long time,' basu said.  in milwaukee, wisconsin, daily cases rose from 260 per 100,000 in early april to almost 1,300 per 100,000 on may 22, a 400 percent jump  in columbia, new york, daily infections have surged from nearly 600 per 100,000 on april 5 to almost 3,000 on may 22, which is yet another jump of 400 percent  however, researchers found similar spikes in northern states.  in milwaukee, wisconsin, daily infections have surged from 260 per 100,000 in early april to almost 1,300 per 100,000 on may 22.  on may 13, the wisconsin supreme court struck down gov tony evers' extended safer at home order, calling it was unconstitutional.  almost immediately after, patrons packed together inside several bars, dancing and banging on the bar tops.  but, over the last several days, cases have continue to rise.  on saturday, more than 20 percent of cases came back positive, the fifth day in a row this had occurred, reported the milwaukee journal sentinel.  the county's goal is to have 10 percent or fewer tests come back positive, which it has not seen since may 9.  even in columbia, new york - where cases and deaths statewide are decreasing - infections are increasing.  daily infections have spiked from nearly 600 per 100,000 on april 5 to almost 3,000 on may 22, the graphs show.  this is even as the county, which in new york's mid-hudson region, began reopening last week.  by tracking down the true number of infections, basu says this can help policymakers decide when and how to safely reopen regions across the us.  'the key thing here is the economy is extremely important to open and we all are waiting for that to happen but the only way that can happen safely is to broadly test people and a plan to quarantine and provide that information so that we don't see a jump again,' he said.  if we have to shut down the economy again after reopening, i think that would be a worse thing than delaying it for some time now and doing it the right way.'  the team's calculations also found that coronavirus deaths in the us are anywhere between 350,000 and 1.2 million, making it far deadlier than most viruses.  by comparison, there were only about 30,000 to 35,000 deaths from flu in the first two months of the most recent flu season.  'i think covid-19 has been shown to be much fatal than the flu virus, among those who fall sick,' basu said.  the new graphs come on the heels of projections from the policylab at children's hospital of philadelphia that show several several are at risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections within the next months.  researchers say cities such as dallas and miami could see covid-19 infections surge to about 700 cases per day.  and houston, the fourth-most populated city in the us, could see daily cases surge to more than 2,000 per day.  gatherings have been taking place more frequently across the us, fueling fears of s resurgence in cases.  in arkansas, gov asa hutchinson told reporters that several people who attended a high school swim party has contracted the virus.  in atlanta, georgia, several graduates of the lovett school, a prep school, became infected with coronavirus.  among them was a graduating senior who attended drive-through graduation parade on may 17.  additionally, videos emerged from lake of the ozarks showing hundreds of people at a crowded pool party.  'this reckless behavior endangers countless people and risks setting us back substantially from the progress we have made in slowing the spread of covid-19,' said st louis county executive dr sam page.  on tuesday, a new  analysis showed 20 states have reported an increase in new cases for the week ending may 24, an increase from 13 states the previous week.  the top five states were all in the south with south carolina seeing the biggest weekly increase at 42 percent and alabama coming in second at 26 percent.  rounding out the top five were alabama at 28 percent from the previous week, missouri at 27 percent and north carolina at 26 percent.  additionally, new cases in georgia, one of the first states to aggressively reopen, surged 21 percent after two weeks of declines."
health,"told downing street briefing the r-rate is between 0.7 and 0.9 but remains 'very close' to one in some places  advertisement  sir patrick vallance, the chief scientific officer, today said the r number of the coronavirus is now between 0.7 and 0.9, down from 0.7 to 1 last week  britons should not to get carried away with news that lockdown is loosening because the virus' r-rate is still dangerously close to 1, the government's top scientific adviser has warned as health chiefs announced another 377 people have died of the coronavirus in britain - pushing the total number of fatalities to 37,837.  sir patrick vallance revealed the current r-rate is between 0.7 and 0.9, and while coronavirus case numbers were declining, they are 'not coming down fast' in a downbeat update at tonight's downing street press conference.  the reproduction rate denotes the number of other people an infected patient will pass the sickness on to and it must stay at 1 or below or britain will face another crisis. however, the way the r is calculated means it is out of date, and the latest calculation is based on data from around three weeks ago - before the lockdown loosened.  'the current value is somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, so it remains close to one. it may very close to one in some areas,' said sir patrick. 'the numbers are coming down at the moment, but they are not coming down fast.'  in separate data released today by the office for national statistics shows that around 3.7million people in england have already had coronavirus, a similar estimate to the 17 per cent of londoners and five per cent elsewhere.  but worryingly, it also revealed that of the people testing positive for covid-19 in its nationwide scheme, only around one in seven actually had symptoms, suggesting that the virus is spreading silently through the population.  the ons data also showed the progress of the outbreak shrinking is slow and the presence of the virus in the community has dropped only 0.01 per cent in the past week. the body described the outbreak as 'relatively stable'.  there are still 54,000 new infections happening each week - down from 61,000 per week at the start of may - and 133,000 people are thought to currently have the virus, down from 137,000. this means one in 1,000 people catch it each week. and the coronavirus's reproduction rate - the r - is now between 0.7 and 0.9, which is slightly lower than last week, when the range was 0.7 to 1.  explaining that 8,000 people per day are still catching the infection, sir patrick said: 'that is not a low number. so it's worth remembering that we still have a significant burden of infection. we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate, and the r is close to 1. that means there is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously, step-by-step, and monitored.'  separate data released today for the first time shows that one in every 14 people (7 per cent) in england - around 3.7million people - have already had coronavirus, according to first published results of its antibody surveillance testing scheme, which found 60 of 885 people whose blood was analysed had covid-19 specific antibodies.  it suggests 4.5million people across the uk have been exposed to the virus - a similar estimate to the 17 per cent of londoners and five per cent elsewhere announced last week by health secretary matt hancock. that would indicate the mortality rate of the virus in the uk, based on a suspected 51,095 deaths, is around 1.14 per cent, meaning one in every 88 coronavirus patients dies.  worryingly, the ons revealed that of the people testing positive for covid-19 in its nationwide scheme, only 21 per cent actually had symptoms at the time their positive sample was taken. this suggests the virus is still spreading silently through the population and potentially tens of thousands of people have no idea they've got it.  as a result of the stable outbreak, boris johnson has announced lockdown will loosen from next week. people will be able to meet in gardens and parks in groups of up to six, provided they can maintain social distancing. he said people are still not allowed to visit people indoors.  the pm confirmed that schools will start to reopen next week and car showrooms and 'outdoor retail' will be able to reopen. other 'non-essential' shops will be allowed to reopen from mid-june, mr johnson said, providing there are no signs of the outbreak bouncing back.  in other developments to britain's coronavirus crisis today:  a durham police investigation found dominic cummings did not break lockdown rules with his 260-mile trip to find childcare - but he might have breached guidance when he travelled 60 miles to barnard castle;  the government's contact tracing site crashed on launch this morning amid complaints it has been a 'complete shambles', with workers paid £10 an hour to sit at home and do nothing on its first day;  nicola sturgeon declared that lockdown is easing in scotland - groups of up to eight people allowed to mix in parks and gardens. boris johnson is due to make tweaks to the draconian coronavirus curbs this afternoon;  matt hancock performed a u-turn on the prospect of britons being able to take summer holidays abroad this year as he suggested they may now be possible - despite saying they were 'unlikely' earlier this month;  the rnli came under fire following the deaths of three people at britain's beaches over the bank holiday weekend after it suspended coastal patrols because of the coronavirus crisis;  april was the deadliest month on record in england and wales, according to shocking official figures that showed 88,000 people died across the two countries - double the 44,000 recorded last april;  sandwich and coffee chain pret a manger will reopen more than 200 sites for takeaway and delivery from next monday, with new social distancing measures in place.  how do key statistics compare this and last week? measure % of people infected: total currently infected: new cases per week: new cases per day: r rate: % of ventilators used: hospital admissions: deaths announced: new positive tests: last week (may 21) 0.25% 137,000 61,000 8,714 0.7 - 1.0 13% 697 338 2,615 this week (may 28) 0.24% 133,000 54,000 7,714 0.7 - 0.9 11% 475 377 1,887 advertisement  sir patrick vallance revealed the current r-rate is between 0.7 and 0.9, and while coronavirus case numbers were declining, they are 'not coming down fast' in a downbeat update at tonight's downing street press conference  statisticians said around 0.24 per cent of the population of england and wales are currently thought to have the coronavirus - around 133,000 people (left). young adults between 20 and 49 appear to be more likely to test positive for covid-19 than people in other age groups, although this is only a significant difference when compared to 50 to 69-year-olds (right)  prime minister boris johnson said today that 475 people were admitted to hospitals with covid-19 across the entire of england yesterday and said there has been a 'sustained and consistent fall' in fatalities.  the ons has based this week's statistics on swab tests carried out on 18,913 people across 8,799 households in england and wales. it found that 36 people tested positive for the virus from 27 separate households.  it suggests about 133,000 people are carrying the virus. ons officials said it was possible this number was as low as 62,000 or as high as 250,000 - the tests are based on small samples of the population so have to account for a margin of error.  although people who had symptoms were more likely to test positive (6.78 per cent vs 0.38 per cent), the ons found that only 21 per cent of all the people who have tested positive so far had symptoms at the time of the swab.  april 2020 had twice as many deaths as april 2019 and was deadliest month on record april was the deadliest month on record in england and wales, according to shocking official statistics released today that lay bare the true toll of the coronavirus crisis. data shows 88,153 people died last month across the two countries - more than double the amount recorded last april (44,123) or before the outbreak spiralled out of control in february 2020 (43,653). the figure, released by the office for national statistics (ons), shows the arrival of covid-19 on british shores led to people dying at twice the rate they would in a normal month. in london this effect was even worse, with startling figures showing the number of people who died in april was triple what it was in the same month last year. counting people who had coronavirus listed as their official cause of death, the number of fatalities nationwide in april was 27,764. but experts say the true death toll of the infection is considerably higher because many patients will have been undiagnosed or their cause of death inaccurately recorded. the ons statistics published today show the number of people who have died of any cause, month by month. in january this year, 56,706 people died in england and wales, which was high but not unheard of for winter. that was followed by 46,653 in february and 49,723 in march. april, however, brought a huge spike to 88,153 - 0.15 per cent of the entire population. the first death from coronavirus in an nhs england hospital happened on march 2 and there were 3,857 during that month. there were 17,774 in april. regionally the biggest increase in deaths between april last year and april this year happened in london, where it rose 197 per cent from 4,102 to 12,175. it also more than doubled in the west midlands, which is centred around birmingham, from 4,527 to 9,932 (119 per cent). and in the north west, including lancashire, cumbria and manchester, it rose by 112 per cent from 5,835 to 12,354. other regions saw substantial increases but their numbers less than doubled. the absolute most deaths happened in the south east, which includes surrey, hampshire and kent, where 12,823 people died in april. this was a 90 per cent increase on 6,765 people in april 2019.  this is possible because there's a much smaller group of people who have the symptoms - a new cough, high temperature, or changed sense of taste or smell - so every positive test is a greater increase in the proportion.  it suggests that a staggering 79 per cent of people infected with the coronavirus did not show any typical signs of illness at a moment when they tested positive and thus may have been unknowingly infectious if out in public.  peter benton, director of population and public policy operations at the ons, said: 'if 70 per cent of people are asymptomatic, potentially - if people have tested positive - that potentially means there are people who are infectious who don't know it.  'and therefore, social distancing we have in place continues to be important.  'what we don't know is, just because somebody's tested positive, we don't know what that means about whether they are infectious. so we can only make assumptions about that.'  on the other hand, only 6.74 per cent of people who did have coronavirus symptoms actually tested positive for the virus. this suggests that either the testing is flawed or 93 per cent of people with a fever, cough or lost sense of smell or taste do not have covid-19.  professor sarah walker, an infectious disease expert at the university of oxford, added: 'what has also been clear is that actually when people report symptoms a relatively small proportion have actually got the infection.  'so i think it's a little bit tricky to say that those who report symptoms and have a positive test have definitely got it and those who don't report symptoms and have a positive test are all false positives.'  these swab tests, which use samples from inside people's noses, have found that neither men nor women are more likely to test positive for the virus.  but this week's results did find, for the first time, that there was some variation across age groups.  people aged between 20 and 49 were most likely to test positive (around 6.2 per cent), but this was only statistically significant when compared with people aged between 50 and 69.  this may be because younger people are more likely to have been working through the lockdown and less likely to be shielding because of health problems.  for other age groups there were no significant differences in infection rates.  the only factor which has clearly been seen to increase someone's risk of testing positive for the virus is whether or not they work in a patient-facing role in the nhs or care sector.  these hands-on care workers have tested positive in 1.73 per cent of the swabs, compared to 0.38 per cent of people who work in other jobs.  this did not include medical staff who were tested through work, and only those who were randomly selected for the ons survey and described themselves as a medical or care worker.  a separate set of data, not published before, was based on 885 blood tests to look for signs of coronavirus-specific antibodies in members of the public.  antibodies are substances produced by the immune system when it fights off a certain infection; they are only present in people who have had a disease or the vaccine for it, and can be used to see who has had the illness in the past.  the tests for it have been analysed by researchers at the university of oxford and the university of manchester from people who have provided blood samples since april 26.  their finding that 6.78 per cent of the sample had the antibodies suggest the same rate of infection has been experienced across england, at least. it is reasonable to scale that to the entire of the uk, suggesting around 4.5million people have been infected.  although people with symptoms are significantly more likely to test positive for the coronavirus, worrying data shows that only around one in seven people who test positive had symptoms at the time they were infectious. this suggests many thousands of people may be spreading the virus without knowing they've got it  random testing has not shown any difference in the likelihood of different sexes testing positive for the coronavirus (left) and the only factor which appears to significantly affect someone's likelihood of testing positive for covid-19 is whether they work in a patient-facing role in the nhs or care sector (right)  on how this could affect the death rate of the virus in britain, cambridge university statistician professor david spiegelhalter said: 'as a back-of-envelope calculation, the latest ons survey suggests around 6.8 per cent of 56million people in england have been infected, which is around four million, and there's been around 40,000 deaths in england linked to covid.  'so this suggests that infection has carried around a 1 per cent average mortality rate. which is impressively close to the much-disputed estimate of 0.9 per cent made by the imperial college team back in march.'  virus r rate is between 0.7 and 0.9, 'but still close to 1' the reproduction rate of the coronavirus has dropped and the range it could be in is now somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, government scientists confirmed today. sir patrick vallance made the announcement in this afternoon's downing street briefing with a warning that the number is still 'very close to 1'. as the british government eases lockdown it must not allow the r to creep above 1, which would mean a second wave of infections could return. an r of 0.7 would mean every 10 people infected pass the virus on to another seven people, while 0.9 would mean they pass it on to a further nine. earlier today professor graham medley, an epidemiologist at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, said the r seemed to be the same in every part of the uk. he said: 'i have not seen any data that would lead me to be believe that there are any regional differences,' the bbc reported. 'the epidemics in each region looked very similar.  the first minister of wales, mark drakeford, has said the r infection rate in the country remains at 0.8.  discussing the state of the r rate in wales ahead of the relaxing of lockdown measures so people from two different households can meet each other outdoors, mr drakeford told bbc radio 4's today programme: 'well it is falling. the r rate across wales is no better today than it was three weeks ago, which is why we have only limited headroom to make any difference.  'and that is why we decided to focus on this one measure to allow households to see one another.'  variations on the measures will be introduced in england and scotland.  asked what the r rate is currently, he said: 'it was 0.8 three weeks ago, it is 0.8 today. for care homes it will be a little bit above that, for hospitals it will be below that, but it is falling in all contexts, but slower than we had hoped.  'and that is why we have limited headroom, can offer just one step forward and still remain in wales determined to do this in as careful and as cautious way as is necessary.'  mr drakeford said the number of deaths in care homes has been 'deeply distressing' but that 'at every stage the welsh government has instituted the policies that were recommended to us by our scientific and medical advisers'.  last week, matt hancock announced that similar testing by public health england had suggested 17 per cent of people in london had been infected, along with five per cent of the rest of the country.  the true size of britain's outbreak remains a mystery because of the controversial decision to abandon swab testing in the general population early on in the crisis before it spiralled out of control, meaning millions of cases were never recorded.  it also means britain's coronavirus mortality rate is very high and not an accurate reflection of how deadly the virus really is.  for example, the department of health's death toll - which is much lower than the true number because it only includes lab-confirmed cases - stands at 37,460. but only 267,000 have cases have been diagnosed - giving it a death rate of around 14 per cent.  antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it.  and blood samples taken from around the world have suggested the true infection-fatality rate is between 0.2 and 0.8 per cent. for comparison, flu kills around 0.1 per cent of all cases.  other shocking statistics revealed today showed that april was the deadliest month on record in england and wales.  a total of 88,153 people died last month across the two countries - more than double the amount recorded last april (44,123) or before the outbreak spiralled out of control in february 2020 (43,653). the figure, released by the office for national statistics (ons), shows the arrival of covid-19 on british shores led to people dying at twice the rate they would in a normal month.  in london this effect was even worse, with startling figures showing the number of people who died in april was triple what it was in the same month last year.  how many brits have really had covid-19? and what is the true mortality rate? the true size of britain's outbreak remains a mystery because of the controversial decision to abandon mass-testing early on in the crisis before it spiralled out of control, meaning millions of cases were not recorded. it also means britain's coronavirus mortality rate is very high and not an accurate reflection. for example, the department of health's death toll - which is much lower than the true number because it only includes lab-confirmed cases - stands at 37,460. but only 267,000 have cases have been diagnosed - giving it a death rate of around 14 per cent. antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it. and blood samples taken from around the world have suggested the true infection-fatality rate is between 0.2 and 0.8 per cent. for comparison, flu kills around 0.1 per cent of all cases. half of brits 'have had it', oxford study says leading scientists have been left to guess about exactly how many britons have been struck down with covid-19, using mathematical-based formulas to estimate the spread of the virus in the uk. one controversial oxford university study - which has since been - suggested up to half of britain has had the disease, which would suggest around 33million people had been infected. but this would also suggest that the mortality rate in britain is around 0.15 per cent, much lower than most estimates made by scientists who have closely watched the pandemic. 12% of england have had it, phe study claims another estimate, calculated by experts at cambridge university and public health england, suggested 12 per cent of england had antibodies - 6.5million people. it claimed the rate was highest in london (20 per cent). the data - given to the scientific pandemic influenza sub-group on modelling - suggested that covid-19 kills around 0.63 per cent of people it infects - a similar figure to other estimates from around the world. 17% of london had covid-19, hancock says health secretary matt hancock revealed last thursday that almost one in five people in london - 17 per cent - have already developed covid-19 antibodies, adding to evidence that the capital was the uk's epicentre. meanwhile the rate across the rest of the uk appeared to be around five per cent - around 4.38million people in total. this sum is based on 1.53million estimated cases in london and 2.85million elsewhere. the figures suggested that the death rate in london was considerably lower - around 0.62 per cent at the time - than it was in the rest of the uk, where it appeared to be closer to 1.39 per cent.  counting people who had coronavirus listed as their official cause of death, the number of fatalities nationwide in april was 27,764. but experts say the true death toll of the infection is considerably higher because many patients will have been undiagnosed or their cause of death inaccurately recorded.  the ons statistics published today show the number of people who have died of any cause, month by month.  in january this year, 56,706 people died in england and wales, which was high but not unheard of for winter. that was followed by 46,653 in february and 49,723 in march.  april, however, brought a huge spike to 88,153 - 0.15 per cent of the entire population.  the first death from coronavirus in an nhs england hospital happened on march 2 and there were 3,857 during that month. there were 17,774 in april.  regionally the biggest increase in deaths between april last year and april this year happened in london, where it rose 197 per cent from 4,102 to 12,175.  it also more than doubled in the west midlands, which is centred around birmingham, from 4,527 to 9,932 (119 per cent).  and in the north west, including lancashire, cumbria and manchester, it rose by 112 per cent from 5,835 to 12,354.  other regions of the country saw substantial increases but their numbers less than doubled.  the absolute most deaths happened in the south east, which includes surrey, hampshire and kent, where 12,823 people died in april. this was a 90 per cent increase on 6,765 people in april 2019.  some areas were hit significantly harder than others, the data shows, with the london borough of haringey experiencing the biggest rise in deaths between april 2019 and 2020. fatalities there rose from just 80 in april 2019 to 353 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic - a surge of 341 per cent.  newham, in east london, also recorded a more than four-fold rise in deaths, increasing 328 per cent from 95 to 407.  nine out of 10 of the areas with the biggest increases in people dying were in london - haringey (341 per cent), newham (328 per cent), brent (289 per cent), enfield (257 per cent), lewisham (255 per cent), waltham forest (248 per cent), barnet (243 per cent), redbridge (243 per cent) and harrow (239 per cent).  third worst after newham was hertsmere in hertfordshire, where the number of deaths rose from 70 to 278 (297 per cent).  an analysis by the financial times has suggested that the uk has the highest rate of death in the western world since the coronavirus outbreak started.  it calculated the number of excess deaths per million people to work out the impact the pandemic has had both on people who caught the virus themselves and who died as a secondary effect.  there have also have been extra deaths among people who were afraid or unable to go to hospital, or because patients had treatment delayed by overloaded hospitals.  the ft found britain has had 891 extra deaths per million during the pandemic, compared to fewer than 800 for italy, the second worst ranked country, and 200 per million in the us.  the us has the highest number of total deaths of anywhere in the world, with more than 100,000 people now dead because of covid-19. britain's toll is second worst, with an official count of 37,460. the true number is expected to rise above 50,000 when death certificate data has been collected for may.  last week, matt hancock announced that testing by public health england had suggested 17 per cent of people in london had been infected, along with five per cent of the rest of the country. this put the death rates, at the time, at about 1.39 per cent outside of london and 1.12 per cent within the city"
health,"the strain of coronavirus that triggered washington's epidemic likely did not arrive in the state until two weeks after president donald trump closed the us border to travelers from china, a new study suggests.  previous research suggested the strain of virus found in the first-ever us patient - a 34-year-old man in snohomish county, diagnosed in january - quickly mutated into the iteration that infected scores more people in washington.  but new computer models made by university of arizona scientists to replicate the way sars-cov-2 mutates could barely replicate that scenario.  instead, their research, posted to biorxiv, but not yet in a peer-reviewed journal, suggests the form of the virus that spread in washington arrived with americans permitted to return to the us and funnelled through seattle-tacoma international airport in the following weeks.  during the intermittent weeks, travel to and from china was halted and the cdc produced its coronavirus test, but testing remained scattershot - a shortcoming that may have allowed the rapid spread of the disease in the us's first outbreak.  university of arizona researchers found that the first us coronavirus case, known as w1 (bottom left) was a relative dead-end of transmission. cases that led to more significant spread more likely arrived around february 13 (upper right)  'our analyses reveal an extended period of missed opportunity when intensive testing and contact tracing could have prevented sars-cov-2 from becoming established in the us and europe,' the researchers write.  the case of the first identified us coronavirus patient - dubbed 'wa1' - was an exemplary one, from a public health standpoint.  he was a young man, who returned via sea-tac international airport on january 15, and had been closely monitoring the news and public health advisories.  as soon as he developed symptoms, wa1 called his doctor before coming to a health care facility and getting tested.  by january 19, the genome of the virus that had infected the man was sequenced and his contacts were swiftly identified and isolated.  in the meantime, other washington residents, of course, were not being tested, and thousands of americans poured back to the us from china.  and the new research suggests that it was with those travelers that the strain of coronavirus that spread through washington came.  all viruses mutate, but compared to others, we now know that sars-cov-2 evolves relatively slowly.  so when the asu team simulated the mutation of the virus and thousands of transmissions.  the researchers estimate that the strain that spread in washington arrived from china's hubei province around february 13 (blue arrow) and from europe to new york city around february 20 (yellow arrow)  they concluded that the strain from wa1 was a relatively dead-end one, discovering instead that the form of coronavirus that exploded in washington arrived on or around february 13 - nearly two weeks after the travel ban for china was enacted on february 2.  during the intervening weeks, the focus remained on the shutdown of travel from china.  the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) shipped its coronavirus test kits starting on february 5, but they trickled out to stats, had to be validated, and many turned out to be flawed.  on a positive note, the researchers credit washington's response to the identification of wa1 - including contact tracing and social distancing - for keeping that first infection from spreading through the state immediately.  on the other hand, they note that the response nationwide lagged in those same categories, leaving an open window for additional cases to enter the us and spread."
health,"while many of us follow stay-at-home orders and wait for lockdowns to end, healthcare workers continue to battle on the frontlines against the novel coronavirus.  doctors and nurses from all hospital departments suddenly found themselves as first responders in intensive care units intubating patient after patient, trying to treat and prevent the spread of the highly-infectious disease.  one of them is dr tazeen beg, an anesthesiologist at stony brook university medical center in long island, new york - a 600-bed facility that essentially turned into a covid-19 hospital.  the 53-year-old has treated hundreds of patients over these last two months and says there are several moments that have 'stayed with her' during such unprecedented times.  speaking with dailymail.com, beg explained what her days have been like, the challenges she and her co-workers face as they treat seriously ill patients, and the heartbreaking moment in which a patient asked her if he was going to die.  dr tazeen beg (pictured), 53, is an anesthesiologist at stony brook university medical center in long island, new york  when the coronavirus pandemic hit, beg became a frontline worker on the airway team, intubating patients across the hospital. the airway team at stony brook university medical center, beg (center) with two colleagues  prior to the pandemic, beg was arriving to the hospital at 6.30am to get ready for her day of operations.  some days she was in the main operating rooms where she provided continuous pain relief and sustained critical life functions during surgeries.  other days, she was an anesthesia coordinator, deciding which cases go to which operating room, and sometimes she would be providing sedation for non-surgical operations such as colonoscopies.  beg would start seeing patients around 7.30am and, on a typical day, she would head home between 5pm and 6pm.  that all changed after the pandemic hit.  long island has been one of the hardest hit regions of new york, the epicenter of the us coronavirus outbreak.  as of thursday, nassau and suffolk county have nearly 80,000 confirmed cases of the illness and more than 4,500 deaths.  at stony brook university medical center, hundreds of new covid-19 patients were coming through the doors every day.  'i volunteered for the covid airway team, which means i was responsible for all the covid intubations, whether it was in the emergency room or on the floors or in the icu,' beg said.  'we were providing intubations because they were the sickest of the sick patients.'  she and other members of her team began working 12-hour shifts for seven days at a stretch before getting a couple of days off.  beg would dress every day in scrubs, a surgical gown, a hood, three pairs of disposable gloves and a n95 mask with a surgical mask over it.  'it has been very exhausting, both mentally and physically,' she said.  'sleepless hours at night, fearing the unknown you know since there is not a standard treatment nor a vaccine.'  one of the most striking covid-19 cases for beg was of a young man between the ages of 27 and 28.  he was very short of breath and his other vital signs showed he was ill, but he sitting up in his hospital bed on his phone.  beg says that a lot of the younger patients that she's come across don't seem to understand how ill they are.  'we went in, i spoke to him and i told him what we we're going to do and said: ""we're going to make sure you're safe and comfortable,""' she said.  'he just looked up from his phone and asked: ""will i wake up from this?"" and the second question was: ""am i going to die?""  'that is something that stays back with you.'  another patient, a man in his 40s, only spoke spanish and didn't understand the nurses when they said they had to intubate him and kept refusing.  eventually, after getting his family on the phone, whom acted as his translators, he consented.  according to beg, the man in his 20s was discharged from the hospital one week later while the man in his 40s is still there, last she checked.  beg's other big fear is getting her family ill so she's taken several precautions to make sure she keeps her husband and two college-aged daughters safe.  she changes out of the scrubs she's been wearing during her shift into a clean pair of scrubs on her drive home.  'i leave my shoes outside the garage. we have a small area in the garage where we have some rubbing alcohol spray to clean my phone, take it out of the cover.  'then i walk straight into the shower and i have a small room right next to the garage where i've been staying since march 14.'  if she ever leaves the room to go to other areas of the house, she wears a mask.  while beg worries about contracting covid-19, she said she is very appreciative of the outpour of support for frontline workers.  she says she wants to encourage all medical staffers to take just as much care of themselves as they are of patients.  'we are very committed and passionate about our profession so we are proud to be able to serve, but we should always remember we are certainly not invincible,' she said.  'my piece of advice for other healthcare workers is there is no emergency in a pandemic to rush into a patient's room. we need you to be healthy so that you can take care of others. so put on your ppe first before entering the patient's room.

health,"advertisement  boris johnson tonight gave the green light to the first limited socialising since lockdown as he revealed that up to six people can now meet outdoors and in private gardens for barbecues - as long as they stay six feet away from each other.  an upbeat pm revealed that the draconian restrictions are being eased slightly from next week, as he formally reduced the country's covid 'alert' status from four to three.  despite warnings from chief scientific adviser patrick vallance that 8,000 new infections are still happening every day and admitting making the rules more nuanced will create 'anomalies and inconsistencies', mr johnson unveiled a series of changes to take effect in england from monday.  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends - although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules. they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned.  non-essential shops and primary schools will start to reopen from next month, as had been suggested earlier in the week.  mr johnson told the daily downing street briefing: 'i cannot and i will not throw away all the gains we have made together. so the changes that we have made are limited and cautious.'  the premier said there was no question of people being given permission to stay overnight, or spend time in other homes. however, he added: 'we want people to be able to see their friends and family. we want people to be able to see both parents at once...  'you could even have a barbecue provided you did it in a socially distanced way.'  chief medical officer chris whitty confirmed that people can go to the toilet in other people's houses if they come to visit, but it was 'absolutely critical' that they wiped everything down afterwards and washed their hands rigorously.  the bigger than expected move comes despite concerns having been raised in cabinet that a 'barbecue clause' could lead to a fresh flare-up in infections.  nicola sturgeon made her move first this lunchtime, by announcing tweaks in scotland that mean up to eight people can meet up in their own gardens from tomorrow - although only two households can meet at once.  in other dramatic developments today:  another 377 people have died of the coronavirus in britain, officials announced today, pushing the total number of fatalities to 37,837 as a blood-testing survey suggests seven per cent of people have had the virus;  a durham police investigation found dominic cummings did not break lockdown rules with his 260-mile trip to find childcare - but he might have breached guidance when he travelled 60 miles to barnard castle;  the government's contact tracing site crashed on launch this morning amid complaints it has been a 'complete shambles', with workers paid £10 an hour to sit at home and do nothing on its first day;  matt hancock performed a u-turn on the prospect of britons being able to take summer holidays abroad this year as he suggested they may now be possible - despite saying they were 'unlikely' earlier this month;  the rnli came under fire following the deaths of three people at britain's beaches over the bank holiday weekend after it suspended coastal patrols because of the coronavirus crisis;  april was the deadliest month on record in england and wales, according to shocking official figures that showed 88,000 people died across the two countries - double the 44,000 recorded last april;  sandwich and coffee chain pret a manger will reopen more than 200 sites for takeaway and delivery from next monday, with new social distancing measures in place.  an upbeat boris johnson revealed at the downing street briefing tonight that the draconian restrictions are being eased slightly from next week, as he formally reduced the country's covid 'alert' status from four to three  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends, mr johnson said  how is the lockdown being eased in england from monday? primary schools will start to reopen from june 1, with non-essential shops following from june 15.  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix outdoors, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends - although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules.  using gardens and private outdoor spaces will also be permitted, which was previously banned.  barbecues will be possible providing it is done 'in a socially distanced way'.  staying overnight or spending time at other homes, is still off limits - but it is allowed to go to the toilet as long as you wipe everything down and wash your hands. advertisement  mr johnson said: 'i know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other.  'so from monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart.  'at the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. this was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. so we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces.  'these changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. i know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment.  'but i must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.'  mr johnson stressed that 'minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission'.  he added: 'you should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus.  'and it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden.'  mr johnson admitted there would be 'anomalies' and 'apparent inconsistencies' in the more complicated rules.  'inevitably there may be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules - and clearly what we're proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy,' he said.  'i know many of you will find this frustrating and i am sorry about that. but i'm afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting.'  the official review this afternoon gave the all-clear for schools to begin reopening next week.  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix, although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules. they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned (stock photo)  sunbathers were seen enjoying the hot weather next to tower bridge on the river thames earlier today  the road map to easing the lockdown contained the possibility one household could form a social 'bubble' with one other in a mutual group, but it that has been quietly shelved.  mr johnson said: 'we don't want people to stay overnight, we don't want people to go to other households and stay there, i'm just afraid we're not at that stage.  'what you certainly can imagine is there could be meetings of families in a garden, you could even have a barbecue provided you did it in a socially-distanced way, provided everyone washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense.'  professor whitty said he hoped that 'relatively soon' the number of infections will be low enough to start letting shielded people leave home.  jay, 33, from horsham, who is shielding with her 10-year-old son, asked the downing street briefing how the lockdown was going to be eased for the extremely vulnerable, saying she felt that people like her had been forgotten.  prof whitty said the number of infections must come down to reduce the risk for the shielded and vulnerable.  'and we will get to a stage, we hope relatively soon, where the absolute risk of people has gone down to a low enough level it will be possible in stages for people to leave shielding,' he said.  sturgeon says people can meet up in their gardens from tomorrow nicola sturgeon today declared that lockdown is easing in scotland - with up to eight people allowed to mix in parks and gardens. the scottish first minister unveiled the move in edinburgh hours before boris johnson is due to make his tweaks to the draconian coronavirus curbs, she said from tomorrow two households will be permitted to meet up, while obeying social distancing rules. although there will be no legal limit she urged them to keep numbers to eight or lower. sports such as tennis and golf will also be back on the table, but scots are being encouraged not to travel more than five miles from home apart from for essential work. schools will not be reopened until august 11, after scheduled holidays. under phase one, garden centres, drive-thru food outlets and recycling centres in scotland will be allowed to open while non-essential shops will be asked to remain closed. ms sturgeon announced that teachers would be allowed to re-enter schools to prepare for the proposed return of schools on august 11. people will also now be allowed to sit and sunbathe in local parks. a legal limit will not be put on how far people will be allowed to travel for recreation but the first minister said the 'strong advice' of the scottish government was to stay within five miles. she added: 'we simply don't want, in this phase, large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or beauty spots.'  but sir patrick struck a cautious note, pointing out that 8,000 people were still being infected every day.  he said: 'the number of new infections is estimated to be roughly one in a thousand per week, it means that 54,000 new cases are occurring every week, so somewhere around eight or so thousand per day.  'that is not a low number, so it's worth remembering that we still have a significant burden of infection, we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate and the r is close to one.  'that means there is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously, step-by-step and monitored and the test and trace system needs to be effective in order to manage that.'  health secretary matt hancock said in a round of interviews earlier: 'the good thing that we've learned from the science of this virus in the last few weeks is that the risk of transmission outdoors is much lower - it's not zero, but it is much lower than indoors.  'so, during the summer in particular, a lot of the changes that you can expect to see will be based on the principle that outdoors is safer than indoors.'  the r reproduction rate and the government's new contact tracing regime are seen as crucial to loosen the lockdown safely.  but the back end of the tracing site crashed on launch this morning, amid complaints it has been a 'complete shambles'.  doctors and other staff reported major teething troubles as the much-trumpeted scheme finally got up and running, with some saying they had not even received passwords to start work - although the public-facing web forms were not affected.  meanwhile, nhs chiefs have warned that 'key bits' of the system are not yet operational and it cannot be described as 'world class'.  mps say they were told by the head of nhs test and trace, baroness dido harding, that the local tracking will not be fully in place until the end of june.  the chaotic beginning came as matt hancock laughed off criticism over the delay to the nhs app that was meant to accompany the regime.  the health secretary insisted it was right to press ahead without the phone technology, suggesting it was important to 'get people used' to the principles.  under the plans, anyone with symptoms will immediately self-isolate and book a test, either at a testing centre or delivered to their home. their household should start a 14-day isolation period too.  people sit and enjoy the sunny weather near tower bridge in london this week, as the lockdown is set to be eased  the slides released by the government this evening showed how it believes the tests have been met  britain reveals 377 more covid-19 deaths as study claims 3.7million people - in england may have already had disease another 377 people have died of the coronavirus in britain, officials announced today, pushing the total number of fatalities to 37,837 as a blood-testing survey suggests seven per cent of people have had the virus. the department of health announced that 337 more people have died in england 14 more people have died in wales, 12 in scotland and two in northern ireland. 1,887 more people tested positive for covid-19 yesterday. separate data released today for the first time shows that one in every 14 people in england - around 3.7million people- have already had coronavirus, according to tests on almost 900 people by the office for national statistics. the government body today released the first results of its blood testing scheme, which found 60 people out of 885 (6.78 per cent) tested positive for covid-19-specific antibodies in their immune systems. it suggests that 4.5million people across the uk have been exposed to the virus - a similar estimate to the 15 per cent of londoners and five per cent elsewhere announced last week by health secretary matt hancock. that would indicate that the death rate of the virus in uk, based on a suspected 51,095 deaths, is around 1.14 per cent, meaning one in every 88 coronavirus patients dies. ongoing swab testing shows that 0.24 per cent of the population is currently infected with the disease. this a drop of 0.01 per cent from last week's update and suggests about 133,000 people are carrying the virus. ons officials said it was possible this number was as low as 62,000 or as high as 250,000 - the tests are based on small samples of the population so have to account for a margin of error.  if the test proves negative, everyone comes out of isolation. but if the test is positive, nhs contact tracers or local public health teams will call, email or send a text asking them to share details of the people they have been in close contact with and places they have visited.  the team then emails or texts those close contacts, telling them they must stay home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms, to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus.  however, there were claims that the nhs trace and test website for doctors had crashed this morning.  one contact tracer told lbc radio it had been a 'complete shambles' so far, and they had not received their logon details for the site.  a department of health spokesman denied that the whole system had crashed.  'anyone in the country can log on and book a test if they have symptoms and we have tracers logged on to do their vital work to help stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives,' the spokesman said.  'as with all large scale operations of this kind, some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved.'  ministers have been warned up to two million people could be in isolation at any given time - with doubts over whether some will be willing to stop work if they are only getting statutory sick pay.  the government's own guidance to employers suggests staff could take holiday leave to comply with the isolation orders.  'if people can't work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer,' it says.  in a round of interviews this morning, mr hancock confirmed that the isolation will not be 'legally mandated' at the moment - although he said that could happen in future.  the health secretary was told it was 'not a laughing matter' as he chuckled at suggestions he had rushed the system in before it is actually ready.  statisticians said around 0.24 per cent of the population of england and wales are currently thought to have the coronavirus - around 133,000 people (left). young adults between 20 and 49 appear to be more likely to test positive for covid-19 than people in other age groups, although this is only a significant difference when compared to 50 to 69-year-olds (right)  wales set to follow scottish example on lockdown easing coronavirus restrictions in wales are expected to be relaxed on monday. first minister mark drakeford is set to announce on friday that people from two different households will be able to meet up outdoors, as long as they do not travel more than five miles. under new 'stay local' guidelines, people will still need to observe social distancing when meeting in public or private outdoor spaces. exceptions will allow for travelling to work, to seek care, and shopping for essentials if they are not available locally. the easing of lockdown rules will be formally set out by mr drakeford at the welsh government's daily press briefing on friday. further plans to relax restrictions in the coming weeks are also expected to be discussed.  sky news presenter kay burley pointed out that mr hancock had previously branded the app 'absolutely essential'.  'you said the app was absolutely essential to track and trace. the app is still not ready,' she said.  but as mr hancock dissolved into giggles, she added: 'many of my viewers will think it is not a laughing matter.'  mr hancock argued that the target of getting contact tracing up and running by june 1 had still been met, despite the missing app.  'it's priceless, kay. i'm normally accused of delaying these things and bringing them in too slowly... you can't accuse me both of rushing it and it being delayed,' he said.  'i can't quite tell if you're saying i've gone too slow or too fast.'  mr hancock insisted the government is moving at 'just at the right speed' with the test and trace plan.  'one of the things we learnt in the pilot on the isle of wight was that getting people used to that idea is important to do before we then also add the technological capability, the app, on top,' he said.  but nhs providers chief executive chris hopson said 'very key bits' were still not operational.  'we're in the process of building test and trace,' mr hopson told bbc newsnight.  'there will be a group of contact tracers who will be ready... but there are still very key bits of test and trace that still need to be built.'"
health,"more than 70 percent of hospitalized coronavirus patients who died in one louisiana health system were black, a disturbing new study found.  of the patients hospitalized for covid-19, more than 76 percent were black. only about a third of the community served by the ochsner health system is black.  the new research, published in the new england journal of medicine is just the latest in mounting body of evidence that minority - and especially black - americans are disproportionately being killed by coronavirus.  reasons for this unsettling trend are multiple, complicated and interwoven.  the new orleans-based team noted that black patients were more likely to have underlying health conditions noted for raising risks of severe covid-19, like heart disease or diabetes, to work jobs that increased their exposures to the virus, and are genetically prone to worse inflammation.  more than 70 percent of the coronavirus patients who died in louisiana's ochsner health system were black, a new study reveals. louisiana, where a third of the population, has been hard-hit by coronavirus, which claimed the life of mardi gras royalty, larry hammond, in april. only 10 mourners were allowed at his funeral (pictured)  'this study provides comparative epidemiologic characteristics of black non-hispanic patients who are underrepresented in the covid-19 medical literature to date. the study also sheds light on differences in clinical presentations,' the authors wrote.  that isn't new. rates of poor health outcomes and chronic disease among black americans have long been higher than among white americans while research on minorities has been relatively sparse.  coronavirus does not discriminate, but the same trends have been apparent over the course of the pandemic.  in every practically every measure studied by the ochsner health group, black patients were disproportionately affected.  a total of 3,626 patients tested positive at one of 40 ochsner hospitals, and 70.4 percent of them were black.  black patients represented more than 76 percent of those who tested positive in the ochsner system, which serves a population that is just 31% black  more than 81 percent of critically ill coronavirus patients who needed ventilators were black  only one third of louisiana's population and 31 percent of ochsner patients are black, meaning the proportion of positives was more than double what one would expect if all things were equal.  the researchers posit that one reason black people in louisiana were overrepresented in the positive test results may be the kinds of jobs they work.  most people working in the service industry in the state are members of a minority group, and these people - grocery store employees, fast food restaurant workers - had to continue working throughout the pandemic as their jobs are considered 'essential services.'  low wages paid for these types of positions also mean that these groups were less likely to be able to stay home, and instead went to work where their chances of exposure to coronavirus were higher.  louisiana's nursing homes have been particularly leveled by coronavirus, a topic discussed by governor john bel edwards and president trump in april  about 40 percent of patients that tested positive for covid-19 were admitted to the hospital. eighty percent of them were black.  once again, 80 percent of patients who were so sick they had to be cared for in icus were black, and 81 percent who needed ventilators were black.  black patients admitted to hospitals had higher rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease - all chronic conditions linked to more severe illness in coronavirus patients.  they also showed more markers of inflammation, which some studies have suggested african americans are more genetically prone to, compared to white americans of european descent.  inflammation is particularly worrisome in covid-19, which triggers an inflammatory immune response that often goes off the rails, ultimately overwhelming and killing the patient.  ultimately, 326 patients died of coronavirus in the hospital, and more than 70 percent of them were black.  however, the authors note that the mortality rate per case was actually higher among white patients. the case-fatality rate for white patients was about 30 percent, while for black patients it was about 22 percent.  still, the findings closely match those found in other states like new york and georgia, but is among the largest in the us to look at how black americans are disproportionately affected by coronavirus.  its findings help to elucidate some - although not all - of the factors that contribute to higher death rates among black americans with coronavirus and offers an insight into the additional risks faced by these patients, which may help doctors better treat their infections and complications."
health,"multiple coronavirus vaccines could be ready for mass-use by the end of this year, according to a british pharmaceutical giant.  astrazeneca said it was on track to produce millions of its experimental covid-19 jab - called azd1222 - by september.  the jab, developed by scientists at oxford university, has moved into larger human trials after showing promise in earlier studies.  astrazeneca's chief executive, pascal soriot, said he believed 'several' other vaccines would be ready in the autumn, too.  the cambridge-based firm announced plans last week to scale up production of the vaccine to a billion doses by mid-2021.  glaxosmithkline, headquartered in brentford, and us drugs giants johnson and johnson and pfizer also unveiled plans today to produce a billion doses of their vaccines next year.  speaking at a virtual press conference, the chief executives from the big four pharma companies said human trials of their vaccines were going 'so far, so good'.  astrazeneca's chief executive, pascal soriot, said he believes there will be 'several' covid vaccines ready for mass-use this year  speaking at a virtual press conference, the chief executives from the big four pharma companies leading the race for a coronavirus jab said human trials of their vaccines were going 'so far, so good'  emma walmsley, ceo of brentford-based glaxosmithkline, and dr albert bourla, chairman at pfizer also unveiled plans today to produce a billion doses of their vaccines next year  estimates suggests the world will need around 4.5billion vaccine doses to put an end to the pandemic.  the virus is so hard to track and so easy to spread that experts believe it will continue to spread through the human population indefinitely if a vaccine cannot be found.  what is the oxford vaccine and who can get one? what type of vaccine is it? the vaccine is called azd1222 and is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans. the intellectual rights to its vaccine are owned by the university of oxford and a spin-out company called vaccitech. clinical teams at the oxford university's jenner institute and oxford vaccine group began developing the vaccine in january. it's a type of immunisation known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine. researchers place genetic material from the coronavirus into another virus that’s been modified. they will then inject the virus into a human, hoping to produce an immune response against sars-cov-2. this virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. if the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future. it was developed so rapidly by sarah gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, and her team because they already had a base vaccine for similar coronaviruses. the team have gone through stages of vaccine development that usually take five years in just four months. however, professor gilbert said that none of the normal safety steps had been missed out. will it be successful? professor gilbert has been vocal about her confidence in the vaccine. she acknowledged nobody can be 'completely certain' that it is possible to find a vaccine for covid-19, but the prospects are 'very good'. in an interview before trials began, professor gilbert told the paper she is '80 per cent' confident of its success, 'based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine'. university of oxford scientists are confident they can get the jab for the incurable virus rolled out for millions to use by autumn. but sir patrick vallance, the chief scientific advisor to the government, has said expectations for a vaccine need to be tempered. writing in the guardian ahead of the oxford trials, sir patrick wrote: 'all new vaccines that come into development are long shots; only some end up being successful, and the whole process requires experimentation. this will take time, and we should be clear it is not a certainty.' what obstacles will the team face? some obstacles are expected to emerge while searching for a vaccine. for example, if transmission levels of covid-19 levels drop in the community, it could hamper the oxford study. professor gilbert has said they may have to continue their trials in other countries where more of the virus is circulating in the community. in this case, it could be at least six months before researchers know if the vaccine works. if transmission remains high in the uk, the team could get data within a couple of months. andrew pollard, who is part of the oxford team, said there may be hurdles when testing the vaccine on older people. 'for most vaccines the immune system in older adults, particularly those over 70, doesn't make such good responses,' he said. 'if we did see weaker responses in older adults we also have in our plan that we would look at giving additional doses in that age group to try and improve the immune response.' professor gilbert had previously said her team needed help manufacturing the jabs, warning the uk did not have the facilities to do it alone, before a deal was struck with astrazeneca. how does it compare to other vaccines? according to the world health organisation, 118 covid-19 vaccines are in development worldwide as of may 15. but the uk now joins only the united states and china in beginning human trials. eight vaccine candidates are now in preclinical trials. advertisement  mr soriot told the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers and associations (ifpma) today: 'the hope of many people is that we will have a vaccine – hopefully several - before the end of this year.  'capacity will continue increasing next year, both in terms of manufacturing capacity but also additional vaccines coming.  'we could answer before the end of the year. that's what we are all aiming at and working hard to achieve.'  emma walmsley, ceo of glaxosmithkline, said: 'i want to reinforce how important it is that we have ideally more than one vaccine....we need multiple billion doses as fast as we can collectively.  'this is, in multiple ways, a collective rival against an unprecedented virus.'  the big four companies have agreed to initially sell their 'not for profit' vaccines to countries for the price it costs to make the jab.  but prices will soar when the world health organization (who) brings the global alert down from the level of pandemic.  the news that multiple vaccines could be ready by the autumn raises hopes of millions of people worldwide longing for an end to the pandemic.  but a leading member of the oxford university trial said the study has only a 50 per cent chance of being successfully completed.  lower transmission of the coronavirus in the community means it will be harder for trial participants to catch the virus, and for scientists to see if the vaccine is protective.  oxford university's jenner institute and the oxford vaccine group began development on a vaccine in january, using a virus taken from chimpanzees.  following an initial phase of testing on 160 healthy volunteers between 18 and 55, the study is now set to progress to phases two and three.  it will involve increasing the testing to up to 10,260 people and expanding the age range of volunteers to include children and the elderly.  professor adrian hill, director of oxford university's jenner institute, said he expected fewer than 50 of those to catch the virus. the results could be deemed useless if fewer than 20 test positive.  'we said earlier in the year that there was an 80 per cent chance of developing an effective vaccine by september,' he told the sunday telegraph.  'but at the moment, there's a 50 per cent chance that we get no result at all.  'we're in the bizarre position of wanting covid to stay, at least for a little while. but cases are declining.'  if sars-cov-2, the virus that causes the disease covid-19, is not spreading in the community, volunteers will find it difficult to catch, meaning scientists can't prove whether the vaccine actually makes any difference.  astrazeneca has announced a deal with the us to produce 400million doses of the vaccine - which is still not proven - and 100million for the uk.  britain has agreed to pay for up the doses 'as early as possible' - with ministers hoping for a third of those to be ready for september if proven effective.  the vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans.  the intellectual rights to its vaccine are owned by the university of oxford and a spin-out company called vaccitech.  clinical teams at the oxford university's jenner institute and oxford vaccine group began developing the vaccine in january.  it's a type of immunisation known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine.  researchers place genetic material from the coronavirus into another virus that’s been modified. they will then inject the virus into a human, hoping to produce an immune response against sars-cov-2.  this virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees.  if the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person's bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future.  it was developed so rapidly by sarah gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, and her team because they already had a base vaccine for similar coronaviruses.  the team have gone through stages of vaccine development that usually take five years in just four months.  however, professor gilbert said that none of the normal safety steps had been missed out."
health,"nearly half of all cases of the novel coronavirus may be asymptomatic, a new study suggests.  researchers found that more than 40 percent of patients didn't experience a cough, a fever or difficulty breathing.  these patients were more likely to be younger, female, and have much less damage to organs such as the lung and liver.  previously, the director of the centers for disease control and prevention, dr robert redfield, estimated that one in four patients are asymptomatic.  the team, from zhongnan hospital in wuhan, china - where the worldwide outbreak originated - says its new findings are evidence that the highly-infectious virus may be more widespread than previously believed.  researchers looked at 78 coronavirus patients from wuhan, china, and found that 33 - more than 42% - are asymptomatic. pictured: a customer wearing a protective mask tries on a pair of shoes at sundance shoes in birmingham, michigan, may 27  asymptomatic patients tended to be younger (in their 20s to 40s), women and had less damage to their organs. pictured: nurse paula johnson administers a deep suction tube into the lungs of a coronavirus patient, in the icu at roseland community hospital in chicago, illinois, april 22  for the study, published in jama network open, the team looked at 78 patients who tested positive for the virus from december 24, 2019 to february 24, 2020.  they found that 45 patients were symptomatic with signs such as a dry cough, fever, fatigue and shortness of breath.  however, 33 patients - more than 42 percent - were asymptomatic, meaning they didn't exhibit any of those signs.  asymptomatic patients were more likely to be younger ranging from their late 20s to their early 40s, while symptomatic patients ranged from their mid-30s to early 60s.  females also tended to show no signs of the virus with nearly 67 percent of the asymptomatic group made of women compared to 31 percent of the symptomatic group.  in addition, the group of asymptomatic patients had a 'lower proportion of liver injuries' and had a faster lung recovery at about nine days in comparison with 15 days.  'our finding...suggests that damage to the immune system in asymptomatic infections was milder compared with symptomatic infections,' the authors wrote.  researchers noted that because asymptomatic patients may be unaware of their disease, they likely didn't isolate themselves or seek medical are and, thus, spread the disease to others.  but, fortunately, asymptomatic patients tended to shed the virus for half as long, eight days in comparison with 19 days.  'since patients with asymptomatic covid-19 were relatively concealed, the fact of viral shedding detected via nasopharyngeal swabs must not be ignored,' they wrote.  'therefore, identifying and isolating patients with asymptomatic covid-19 as early as possible is critical to control the transmission of covid-19.'  the team also suggests identifying close contact of coronavirus patients and monitoring them to avoid secondary transmission.  the findings come on the heels of another study, conducted by australian researchers, that looked at passengers on a 21-day antarctic cruise earlier this year.  of the 217 passengers and crew members, 128 tested positive for the virus and an astonishingly high 81 percent did not have symptoms."
health,"a drug for a children's immune disease helped coronavirus patients recover faster, a new study suggests.  ruxolitinib is approved to treat hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hlh), which is a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome among youngsters that can be fatal, by calming down the immune system's overreaction.  scientists from cincinnati children's hospital in ohip say that 10 times as many patients who received the medication saw improvements in their respiratory health compared to those who were given a placebo.  in addition, patients who didn't receive ruxolitinib were 14 percent more likely to die than those who did.  ruxolitinib (pictured) is a drug used to treat hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hlh), a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome in children that can be fatal  scientists believe it can prevent cytokine storms, which occur when the body doesn't just fight off the virus but also attacks its own cells and tissues. pictured: dr joseph varon, head of the covid-19 unit at united memorial medical center in houston, texas, checks on a patient, 43-year-old melquiades cervantes  in addition to hlh, ruxolitinib is a medication used to treat myelofibrosis, which is a cancer of the bone marrow.  ruxolitinib hinders inflammation, which helps control the immune system response, and even kills some kinds of cancer cells.  researchers hope the drug will help ward off cytokine storms, which is when the body doesn't just fight off the virus but also attacks its own cells and tissues.  cytokine storms are also a common feature of children battling secondary hlh, which occurs when initial hlh treatment has not worked.  dr gang huang, a cancer pathologist at cincinnati children's hospital, noticed the feature of both illnesses and decided to see if a drug used to treat one could treat the other.  'i approached our research colleagues in wuhan and explained our observations and recommended this drug be tested to quiet the cytokine storm in the multi-system inflammation in patients with severe covid-19 disease,' huang said.  'the disease was spreading very rapidly and many people were dying. we believed the existing clinical drug would help save lives. so, we worked to push it forward before there is an effective vaccine for everyone.'  for the study, published in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology, the team looked at 43 patients hospitalized with coronavirus between february 9 and february 28.  all of the patients were treated in wuhan, china, where the virus is believed to have originated.  half the patients were randomly selected to receive two daily oral dose of ruxolitinib plus standard care while the other half received a placebo and standard care.  patients who received the drug were more likely to see respiratory improvements and less likely to die than those given a placebo. pictured: nurses care for a coronavirus patient in the icu at regional medical center in san jose, california, may 21  patients treated with ruxolitinib saw clinical improvements in a much shorter amount of time than the control group.  in fact, 90 percent of those who received ruxolitinib patients showed improvements in their ct scans within 14 days.  only nine percent of patients from the control group saw improvements within the same time frame.  additionally, three patients in the control group died of respiratory failure but none of the severely ill patients who received ruxolitinib died.  'this is the first therapy we know of that appears to work effectively to quiet the cytokine storm and inflammation in severe covid-19 disease, and there are no significant toxicities to patients who take the drug by two pills a day,' huang said.  'this is critical until we can develop and distribute enough effective vaccine to help prevent people from becoming infected.'  however, he notes that more studies are needed and that phase ii of a clinical trial being run by incyte and novartis is looking at how the drug affects 400 severely ill coronavirus patients.  preliminary clinical data from the study is expected to be published during the summer."
health,"britons should get an individual covid-19 risk score on a scale from one to five to allow healthy youngsters out of lockdown, scientists say.  top experts have floated the idea of 'stratified shielding' to kickstart the economy again and end the lockdown, which they claim is 'damaging'.  it would involve rating each person's chances of getting infected and dying from infection based on a number of clear risk factors.  these include age, ethnicity and underlying health conditions, obesity and possibly postcode, considering some locations have suffered worse outbreaks than others.  it could free millions of britain from a universal lockdown, while protecting the most vulnerable members of society.  but experts who suggested the scheme admitted it would be difficult to implement because the public may find it unacceptable.  people's covid-19 risk should be scored on a scale from one to five to allow healthy youngsters out of 'damaging' lockdown, scientists say. pictured: people in london fields, may 26  professor george davey smith, of the university of bristol, wrote his thoughts about stratified shielding in an editorial in the british medical journal.  he and sir david spiegelhalter, of the university of cambridge, wrote: 'lockdown is seriously damaging many aspects of people’s lives, harming most those with the least resources.  'as constant vigilance will be required over the coming months and perhaps years, serious consideration should be given to implementing locally informed and implemented strategies to stratify shielding according to risk.'  several studies have modelled 'stratify and shield' strategies, with age being the most viable way to categorise people, the professors said.  a starting point for scoring would be to look at a person's risk depending on their age, gender, ethnicity, underlying health problems, medication use and obesity.  postcodes may also be useful to consider. statistics show people who live in areas with high poverty are more likely to die and hotspots have emerged in the uk over time.  who needs to 'shield' under government guidelines? some groups of people are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness with coronavirus and should strictly follow shielding measures. according to nhs inform, this 'extremely clinically vulnerable' group includes people who: have had solid organ transplants  have cancer and are receiving active chemotherapy  have lung cancer and are either receiving or previously received radical radiotherapy  have cancers of the blood or bone marrow  are receiving immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer  are receiving other targeted cancer treatments, such as protein kinase inhibitors or parp inhibitors  have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs  have severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma and severe copd  have rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections  are receiving immunosuppression therapies there has been confusion over whether over 70s should be shielding, which means not leaving the house even to do food shopping. according to government guidance, over 70s are deemed 'clinically vulnerable', regardless of their health condition. this group also includes anyone who is under 70 but has health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, or chronic heart, kidney or liver disease. these people 'should take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household' but don't need to shield. health secretary matt hancock has previously said in march, however, that over-70s would be asked to 'shield' themselves by self-isolating for several months. he then caused further confusion on may 2, saying there was no 'blanket ban' for over 70s and that message is 'wrong and deeply misleading'. he incorrectly said that over 70s are not 'clinically vulnerable' which they are. advertisement  'a risk score for “getting infected and then dying from the infection” could be constructed from these factors,' the editorial said.  'for communication purposes... people could be assigned to one of five categories - for example, from very low to very high risk.  'appropriate guidance would be provided for each category, but individuals could opt for a lower or higher category depending on their risk appetite, since legal enforcement would be neither beneficial nor practicable.'  the pair said such a method would not be to 'frighten' but allow people to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, rather than everyone being forced to stay at home.  and lifting lockdown for the majority who are low risk would not overwhelm hospitals because it is unlikely those people would get severely sick, they said.  looking at age alone, one shielding model suggested shielding everyone between age 45 and 75 years old, projected to produce 'the largest reduction in mortality'.  but this, and other discriminatory lockdowns, are somewhat implausible, mr smith and professor spiegelhalter said.  it would also be difficult to know when shielding should end, and if it would lead to a sudden wave of deaths.  ideally shielding of high risk people would end when so many people in the population have had the infection that widespread immunity is achieved - called 'herd immunity'.  this would force the virus to fizzle out, but only if people who have had the virus previously are definitely protected from getting it again - which is not proven.  the only other way to gain herd immunity is with a vaccine, which is potentially years away.  experts have warned it's possible a vaccine will never be found because they often fail in experiments.  dr smith said: 'the virus is unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future.'  there are millions of people who have been told to shield in the uk because they are 'extremely clinically vulnerable'.  this group includes people who have specific cancers, severe respiratory conditions or rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections, for example.  there is also a 'clinically vulnerable' group, which includes over 70s, regardless of their health, and anyone who is under 70 but has health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, or chronic heart, kidney or liver disease.  the government doesn’t actually recommend that clinically vulnerable people follow any rules that differ from the universal social distancing guidance.  but these people are being told to follow that guidance carefully, and to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside of their household.  there has previously been confusion over whether over 70s should be shielding, after health secretary matt hancock said in march that over-70s would be asked to 'shield' themselves by self-isolating for several months."
health,"britain still has a 'significant burden of infection', the government's top scientist warned as statistics show the coronavirus crisis has barely changed in a week.  the chief scientific adviser to the government, sir patrick vallance, urged the country not to get carried away with the news that lockdown is loosening.  in a short speech that seemed at odds with the prime minister's enthusiasm for reopening shops and schools next week, and allowing people to meet in groups in their gardens, sir patrick said there is 'not a lot of room to do things'.  statistics show that the progress of the outbreak shrinking is slow and the presence of the virus in the community has dropped only 0.01 per cent in the past week.  there are still 54,000 new infections happening each week - down from 61,000 per week at the start of may - and 133,000 people are thought to currently have the virus, down from 137,000. this means one in 1,000 people are still catching it.  and the coronavirus's reproduction rate - the r - is now between 0.7 and 0.9, which is slightly lower than last week, when the range was 0.7 to 1.  sir patrick said: 'numbers are coming down at the moment but they're not coming down fast'.  sir patrick vallance appeared extremely cautious about the prime minister's decision to loosen lockdown rules at the downing street briefing today. he said: 'we still have a significant burden of infection... there is not a lot of room to do things'  explaining that 8,000 people per day are still catching the infection, sir patrick said: 'that is not a low number. so it's worth remembering that we still have a significant burden of infection.  'we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate, and the r is close to 1.  'that means there is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously, step-by-step, and monitored.'  comparing data from today and last thursday, may 21, shows that the outbreak is shrinking on various measures but it is shrinking at a slow pace.  office for national statistics data last week showed that 0.25 per cent of the population was thought to be infected - some 137,000 people.  that has dropped by a miniscule amount this week to 0.24 per cent - around 133,000. the margin of error means it may not have dropped at all, or may have dropped more. the estimate is based only on 36 positive tests out of 18,913.  the rate of infection suggests that an average 7,714 people are catching the virus every day, down from 8,714 last week.  hospital admissions were markedly lower yesterday than last wednesday, with 475 coronavirus patients going into hospital, compared to 697.  both figures are substantially lower than the peak, when 3,151 people were admitted on april 2.  in hospitals, 11 per cent of ventilators in intensive care units are now being used by covid-19 patients, down from 13 per cent last week. at the peak of the outbreak, on april 10, this was 41 per cent.  how do key statistics compare this and last week? measure % of people infected: total currently infected: new cases per week: new cases per day: r rate: % of ventilators used: hospital admissions: deaths announced: new positive tests: last week (may 21) 0.25% 137,000 61,000 8,714 0.7 - 1.0 13% 697 338 2,615 this week (may 28) 0.24% 133,000 54,000 7,714 0.7 - 0.9 11% 475 377 1,887 advertisement  the number of positive tests was particularly low today, at 1,887 down from 2,615 last week. but this is known to fluctuate daily and it was 4,043 just two days ago on tuesday.  sir patrick, speaking after boris johnson announced the biggest relaxation of lockdown measures so far, said: 'it's still the case that the vast majority of us have not had the infection and this is a virus for which all of us are susceptible.  'so this set of figures urges caution in terms of the measures we take, how we take them and how we monitor them.'  last week: data presented at the downing street briefing last thursday suggested 137,000 people were currently infected with the coronavirus, a rate of 0.25 per cent in the population, and 61,000 new cases were emerging every week  this week: statistics presented at the downing street briefing today showed small decreases in all the data points, but sir patrick vallance cautioned: 'numbers are coming down at the moment but they're not coming down fast'  the pm this afternoon said schools would start to open from monday, outdoor businesses such as car showrooms would be allowed to open, and people could meet up in groups while maintaining social distancing.  how is the lockdown being eased in england from monday? primary schools will start to reopen from june 1, with non-essential shops following from june 15.  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix outdoors, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends - although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules.  using gardens and private outdoor spaces will also be permitted, which was previously banned.  barbecues will be possible providing it is done 'in a socially distanced way'.  staying overnight or spending time at other homes, is still off limits - but it is allowed to go to the toilet as long as you wipe everything down and wash your hands.  the covid alert level was lowered from three to four for the first time as mr johnson said: 'i cannot and i will not throw away all the gains we have made together. so the changes that we have made are limited and cautious.'  up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends - although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules.  they will also be permitted to use gardens and private outdoor spaces, which was previously banned. barbecues will be permitted providing they are done 'in a socially distanced way'.  staying overnight or spending time at other homes, is still off limits, but people will be allowed to enter others' homes to access their garden or to go to the toilet as long as they wipe everything down and wash their hands.  non-essential shops and primary schools will start to reopen from next month, as had been suggested earlier in the week.  this will start with a select few on monday and then likely a broader range of retailers from june 15, after the government's next three-weekly review.  uk announces 377 more covid-19 deaths as study claims 7% - 3.7million people - in england may have already had disease but only one in five people currently infected have symptoms  sir patrick vallance, the chief scientific officer, today said the r number of the coronavirus is now between 0.7 and 0.9, down from 0.7 to 1 last week  another 377 people have died of the coronavirus in britain, officials announced today, pushing the total number of fatalities to 37,837 as a blood-testing survey suggests seven per cent of people have had the virus.  the department of health announced that 337 more people have died in england 14 more people have died in wales, 12 in scotland and two in northern ireland. 1,887 more people tested positive for covid-19 yesterday.  separate data released today for the first time shows that one in every 14 people in england - around 3.7million people- have already had coronavirus, according to tests on almost 900 people by the office for national statistics.  the government body today released the first results of its blood testing scheme, which found 60 people out of 885 (6.78 per cent) tested positive for covid-19-specific antibodies in their immune systems.  it suggests that 4.5million people across the uk have been exposed to the virus - a similar estimate to the 15 per cent of londoners and five per cent elsewhere announced last week by health secretary matt hancock.  that would indicate that the death rate of the virus in uk, based on a suspected 51,095 deaths, is around 1.14 per cent, meaning one in every 88 coronavirus patients dies.  ongoing swab testing shows that 0.24 per cent of the population is currently infected with the disease. this a drop of 0.01 per cent from last week's update and suggests about 133,000 people are carrying the virus.  ons officials said it was possible this number was as low as 62,000 or as high as 250,000 - the tests are based on small samples of the population so have to account for a margin of error.  worryingly, the ons revealed that of the people testing positive for covid-19 in its nationwide scheme, only 21 per cent actually had symptoms at the time their positive sample was taken. this suggests the virus is still spreading silently through the population and potentially tens of thousands of people have no idea they've got it.  they described the outbreak as 'relatively stable' - the same description as last week - and added that about 54,000 people are becoming newly infected each week, down from 61,000 last week. sir patrick vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the government, said today 'that is not a low number'.  as a result of the stable outbreak, boris johnson has announced lockdown will loosen from next week. people will be able to meet in gardens and parks in groups of up to six, provided they can maintain social distancing. he said people are still not allowed to visit people indoors.  the pm confirmed that schools will start to reopen next week and car showrooms and 'outdoor retail' will be able to reopen. other 'non-essential' shops will be allowed to reopen from mid-june, mr johnson said, providing there are no signs of the outbreak bouncing back.  on the other hand, only 6.74 per cent of people who did have coronavirus symptoms actually tested positive for the virus. this suggests that either the testing is flawed or 93 per cent of people with a fever, cough or lost sense of smell or taste do not have covid-19."
health,"your wearable devices might be able to detect that you've been infected with the novel coronavirus days before you experience any symptoms.  there are at least five studies analyzing smart trackers including apple watches, fitbits, oura smart rings, garmin, amazefits and beddits.  researchers want to see if unusual changes in heart rate, activity, skin temperature sleep or other parameters and vitals can predict a covid-19 diagnosis.  preliminary data from two of those studies, examining fitbits and ouras, suggest that the fitness trackers can do just that.  ouras were able to predict that people would experience symptoms such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath up to three days before they appeared.  and fitbits saw a spike in somebody's heart rate nine days before they reported symptoms to their physician.  fitness tracker companies have been teaming up with universities to develop an algorithm to detect the novel coronavirus before wearers show physical symptoms (file image)  early results from west virginia university found that oura smart rings (left) could predict up to three days before someone would experience symptoms. researchers from stanford saw fitbit (right) record a spike in somebody's heart rate nine days before they reported symptoms to their doctor  although fitness trackers were first marketed as a way to count steps, several companies have become interested in combing technology with healthcare.  past research has linked wearable tech with early detection of a number of health issues including high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and even kidney failure.  additionally, several anecdotal stories include patients who say their devices urged them to go to the emergency room before they even suspected they were ill.  last month, fitbit announced it had partnered with stanford medicine and the scripps research institute, to design an algorithm that measures a user's heart rate and skin temperature.  the program would notice unusual patterns, which could predict if a wearer had contracted the virus before showing physical symptoms.  'smartwatches and other wearables make many, many measurements per day - at least 250,000, which is what makes them such powerful monitoring devices,' dr michael snyder, a professor and chair of genetics at the stanford school of medicine, said in a statement at the time.  'my lab wants to harness that data and see if we can identify who's becoming ill as early as possible - potentially before they even know they're sick.'  scientists say the wearable trackers could be beneficial in tracking down and isolating patients before they even receive positive test results. pictured: nurses care for a coronavirus patient in the icu at regional medical center in san jose, california, may 21  researchers told the washington post that early results show fibits can predict covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, either before diagnosis or at the time of diagnosis, in 78 percent of the 14 patients they studied.  in one patient, their heart rate jumped nine days before they even reported symptoms.  in most cases, there were also unusual patterns but it was usually around the time patients noticed symptoms on their own.  'the bottom line is it is working, but it's not perfect,' snyder told the post.  in a second study, oura partnered several institutions including the university of california san francisco medical center and west virginia university.  thousands of medical staff and volunteers wear the rings, about the size of a wedding band, which detect body temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate.  participants wear the rings at night while they sleep and, because they record continuous amounts of data rather than take single readings, researchers believe they'll give a more accurate sense of a person's current health status.  on thursday, wvu's rockefeller neuroscience institute said early results showed they can detect covid-19 related symptoms such as a fever and coughing up to three days before they appear, with 90 percent accuracy.  dr ali rezai, executive chair of the wvu rockefeller neuroscience institute, says this is especially important when it comes to quickly identifying and isolating those at high risk, particularly frontline workers.  'the holistic and integrated neuroscience platform...allows for the accurate prediction of the onset of viral infection symptoms associated with covid-19,' rexai said in a statement.  'we feel this platform will be integral to protecting our healthcare workers, first responders, and communities as we adjust to life in the covid-19 era.'  in the us, there are more than 1.7 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 100,000 deaths."

'we're in the process of building test and trace,' mr hopson told bbc newsnight. staff failed training and can't ring patients one member of staff told mailonline members of her team had failed to complete clinical information training which meant they were not allowed to talk with people diagnosed with covid-19. hancock laughs at claims scheme was rushed matt hancock was told it was 'not a laughing matter' as he chuckled at suggestions he had rushed the system in before it is actually ready. sky news presenter kay burley pointed out that mr hancock had previously branded the app 'absolutely essential'. but as mr hancock dissolved into giggles, she added: 'many of my viewers will think it is not a laughing matter.' advertisement  the team then emails or texts those close contacts, telling them they must stay home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms, to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus.  however, there were claims that the nhs trace and test website for doctors had crashed this morning.  one contact tracer told lbc radio it had been a 'complete shambles' so far, and they had not received their logon details for the site.  a department of health spokesman denied that the whole system had crashed.  'anyone in the country can log on and book a test if they have symptoms and we have tracers logged on to do their vital work to help stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives,' the spokesman said.  'as with all large scale operations of this kind, some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved.'  a £10-an-hour track and trace worker today revealed to mailonline that she is being paid to sit at home and do nothing on the first day the system went into operation.  the worker said some members of her team had failed to complete clinical information training which meant they were not allowed to talk with people diagnosed with covid-19.  and she revealed that those people who test positive for the virus do not have to reveal the names of people they have recently been in contact with.  she said: 'everything is voluntary and if they refuse to give us the names and telephone numbers there is nothing we can do,' said the track and trace agent.  'we work from a script and try to persuade the person to be co-operative but if they hang up we just move on to the next person. it seems a major flaw, but there is nothing we can really do about it.'  the former shop assistant, who asked not to be named, said she was being paid £75 a day – regardless if she made any calls. after two weeks of online training she was sat at home in west london ready to work with the government's much trumpeted track and trace system.  she said: 'some teams have gone live, but i had an email saying members of my team were still undergoing training. we are expected to go live very soon.'  details of those who test positive are passed to a company called sitel who are running the track and trace teams across the uk.  agents read from a prepared script when they are given the name and telephone number of a person who has been diagnosed with covid-19. they ask for the details of friends and family the infected person has come into contact with during the previous 7-14 days. the tracing agent then contact with those on their list and informs them they have to self isolate.  boris johnson, pictured returning to downing street today, is due to announce a loosening of lockdown later  the agent said they do not make any follow up telephone calls to check the people contacted are self isolating.  an army of 25,000 people have been hired at £10.00 an hour to act as the front line of the track and trace operation.  the job was advertised on the online employment site indeed. all employees were given a series of online tutorials explaining how the system works. agents are asked to use their own home computer but do not use their own mobile phones and instead make calls over the internet.  during training the agent said she often sat at home doing nothing while waiting for a password to arrive to be able to log into the system.  she told mailonline: 'i am contracted for 7.5 hours a day at £10 an hour and will be paid regardless of any calls i make. we are getting more people getting in touch about working at the track and trace places – with definite teething problems.'  another track and trace agent said the system was a 'shambles' with many of his team unable to log into a nhs website needed to start work.  the worker said he had been able to log into the system and was ready to receive the names of people infected with the virus – but had not yet made a single call.  like others he is being paid £10 an hour regardless of any making any calls.  the worker told mailonline: 'i was able to log into the system with the password and have been sat here a few hours since starting my shift. there hasn't been a single email for people i should contact. it's a bit frustrating as i'd like to help.'  the agent, who is based at his home in shropshire, said he had been told to expect to speak with one or two people a day who have been diagnosed with the illness.  he would then contact those people who have been in close contact with the person infected and ask them to self isolate.  but like many others among the 25,000 employed as the track and trace team he has heard there were problems.  'i'm part of a team of 30 and we all connected via computer. i know many have spent the morning trying to log into the nhs website but have failed.  government guidance says people might want to take holiday to obey isolation orders the government's own guidance to employers suggests staff could take holiday leave to comply with the isolation orders, it was revealed today. the gov.uk advice says people might 'prefer' to use holiday allocations if sick pay does not cover their usual income. the government's own test and trace advice suggests that workers might want to take holiday so they get full pay while they are following orders to isolate the message emerged amid warnings the new test and trace system will fail to work effectively if statutory sick pay is not increased. there are fears that many people will not be able to afford to isolate and will be forced to keep working. tuc general secretary frances o'grady said: 'we need a testing and tracing programme up and running as soon as possible. 'but it will not be effective if workers are pushed into hardship when they are required to self-isolate. 'statutory sick pay is just £95 per week - and two million workers aren't even eligible for that. 'if workers can't afford to self-isolate, then they will be forced to keep working. 'that will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire test and trace programme. 'the government must extend statutory sick pay to everyone - no matter what they're paid - and raise it to the level of the real living wage, £260 per week. 'and the self-employed income support scheme must remain in place as a source of financial support for those forced to self-isolate. that's how to show that we really are all in this together.' statutory sick pay stands at £95.85 per week, and according to the government website you could get it if you cannot work and are self-isolating. shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth called for 'enhanced' sick pay when he was asked about the new system and people being expected to self-isolate for 14 days if contacted. he told bbc radio 4's today programme: 'there will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make that difficult for them so they need that security, they need enhanced sick pay where necessary to make sure they stay at home. 'but, of course, it is perfectly possible that you could isolate for 14 days, come out, meet somebody else again whose got the virus and have to go back in. so this could be a huge burden for people.' mr ashworth said there is an 'anomaly in the regulations' at the moment, adding: 'sick pay is only triggered, as i understand it, when somebody has tested positive.' he added that this 'urgently needs to be ironed out'.  'they have contacted their team leader who is doing their best to try and sort it, but to be honest from the government side of things it's a bit of a shambles. i know everything has teething problems, but to be honest i thought they would have been ironed out by the time we went live.'  mailonline can also reveal that four giant covid-19 drive thru test centres were deserted today as the track and trace system was launched.  staff at twickenham rugby ground and a newly opened site at heathrow airport stood around in the sunshine with barely a trickle of cars arriving for pre-booked tests. sites in chessington and edinburgh were also empty today.  despite swab tests being available to anyone over the age of five showing symptoms of coronavirus, medics at the test centres who carry out swab tests had hardly anything to do.  less than a dozen cars were at the test centre based at the rear of twickenham rugby ground in west london. a member of staff said they had seen decreasing numbers in the past week with the weekend slots the busiest – despite the government boasting it wanted to carry out up to 200,000 a day.  the centre has the capacity to handle up to 600 people but a day but one member of staff said they were seeing less than 200.  all tests have to be booked online and anyone turning up without an appointment is turned away.  the new site on the eastern perimeter road at heathrow airport has replaced the centre that was one of the first to go into operation in an ikea car park near wembley, north west london.  that site closed down on wednesday as the flat pack furniture store is due to re-open next week.  the mobile test centre and all the equipment have been removed from the store's car park with a solitary security guard on duty at the front gate.  the heathrow site is overlooked by four british airways passenger jets that are parked up outside an engineering hangar.  staff in yellow high viz jackets could be seen standing around talking while waiting for cars to arrive with the one-way system for cars to enter empty.  ministers have been warned up to two million people could be in isolation at any given time - with doubts over whether some will be willing to stop work if they are only getting statutory sick pay.  the government's own guidance to employers suggests staff could take holiday leave to comply with the isolation orders.  'if people can't work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer,' it says.  in a round of interviews this morning, mr hancock confirmed that the isolation will not be 'legally mandated' at the moment - although he said that could happen in future.  the health secretary was told it was 'not a laughing matter' as he chuckled at suggestions he had rushed the system in before it is actually ready.  test and trace will fail to work unless statutory sick pay is not increased, experts warn the test and trace system will fail to work effectively if statutory sick pay is not increased, the government has been warned. those self-isolating will be eligible for statutory sick pay but there are fears that many workers will not be able to afford to isolate and will be forced to keep working. nhs test and trace - seen as key to easing the coronavirus lockdown restrictions - will be rolled out across england on thursday, and there are concerns that people could be asked to self-isolate for period of 14 days more than once in the coming weeks. tuc general secretary frances o'grady said: 'we need a testing and tracing programme up and running as soon as possible. 'but it will not be effective if workers are pushed into hardship when they are required to self-isolate. statutory sick pay is just £95 per week - and two million workers aren't even eligible for that. 'if workers can't afford to self-isolate, then they will be forced to keep working. that will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire test and trace programme. 'the government must extend statutory sick pay to everyone - no matter what they're paid - and raise it to the level of the real living wage, £260 per week. 'and the self-employed income support scheme must remain in place as a source of financial support for those forced to self-isolate. that's how to show that we really are all in this together.' statutory sick pay stands at £95.85 per week, and according to the government website you could get it if you cannot work and are self-isolating. shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth called for 'enhanced' sick pay when he was asked about the new system and people being expected to self-isolate for 14 days if contacted. he told bbc radio 4's today programme: 'there will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make that difficult for them so they need that security, they need enhanced sick pay where necessary to make sure they stay at home. 'but, of course, it is perfectly possible that you could isolate for 14 days, come out, meet somebody else again whose got the virus and have to go back in. so this could be a huge burden for people.'  sky news presenter kay burley pointed out that mr hancock had previously branded the app 'absolutely essential'.  'you said the app was absolutely essential to track and trace. the app is still not ready,' she said.  but as mr hancock dissolved into giggles, she added: 'many of my viewers will think it is not a laughing matter.'  mr hancock argued that the target of getting contact tracing up and running by june 1 had still been met, despite the missing app.  'it's priceless, kay. i'm normally accused of delaying these things and bringing them in too slowly... you can't accuse me both of rushing it and it being delayed,' he said.  'i can't quite tell if you're saying i've gone too slow or too fast.'  mr hancock insisted the government is moving at 'just at the right speed' with the test and trace plan.  'one of the things we learnt in the pilot on the isle of wight was that getting people used to that idea is important to do before we then also add the technological capability, the app, on top,' he said.  amid reports by sky news that some contact tracers do not have their basic systems up and running yet, the department of health insisted that the 'vast majority of our 25,000 staff have completed their training'.  but nhs providers chief executive chris hopson said 'very key bits' were still not operational.  'we're in the process of building test and trace,' mr hopson told bbc newsnight.  'there will be a group of contact tracers who will be ready... but there are still very key bits of test and trace that still need to be built.'  the launch comes as:  the toll of deaths linked to the virus rose to almost 48,000, while at least 188 frontline health and care workers have died after contracting covid-19.  chris hopson, chief executive of nhs providers, said it was 'good news' the government has 'backed off the claim that it was making last week that we have a world-class test and trace system ready to go from june 1 because we clearly don't'.  the prime minister said he has asked scientists to review the two-metre social distancing rule to see if it can be reduced in an effort to help public transport and the hospitality sector.  mr johnson promised to look into a condition of the immigration system which has left people with no state financial support during the coronavirus crisis.  weston general hospital in weston-super-mare, somerset, closed to new admissions to 'avoid being the cause of an outbreak' after tests revealed a number of staff with no symptoms had coronavirus.  emily maitlis did not present last night's episode of newsnight after the bbc ruled the programme breached impartiality rules over its coverage of the dominic cummings lockdown row.  the government's plans to ease the lockdown will be confirmed in an official review later which downing street expects will give the all-clear for schools to begin reopening next week.  downing street insiders suggested the easing discussed by cabinet office minister michael gove was still dependent on the scientific advice, as was the use of private gardens for socialising.  the road map to easing the lockdown contained the possibility one household could form a social 'bubble' with one other in a mutual group, but it was understood that term was being quietly dropped.  the pm has said all non-essential shops in england can reopen from june 15 after he closed them with the imposed lockdown on march 23.  it comes amid a growing revolt within the conservative party over the prime minister's chief adviser's controversial trip to durham - with dozens of backbench tories criticising his actions, and at least 38 calling for him to quit or be sacked.  and senior minister penny mordaunt admitted there were 'inconsistencies' in mr cummings' account - saying 'there is no doubt he took risks'.  boris johnson continued to stand by his aide and insisted it was time to 'move on' when he faced intense questioning over the issue in an appearance before the commons liaison committee of senior mps on wednesday.  labour mp and hospital doctor rosena allin-khan laid into mr hancock on twitter for his giggling about test and trace  however, former home secretary amber rudd added her name to the list of prominent tory figures saying mr cummings should quit.  'yes i think he should quit, because he's making things worse,' ms rudd said on itv's peston programme.  ms rudd said that through various government campaigns mr johnson had seen mr cummings as a 'talisman, a lucky charm, and that he needs him going forward.'  'dominic has been a winner for him on these campaigns but he's not instrumental to good government,' she said.  'and my problem at the moment is that dominic is being negative for good government. he's a public servant, it should be about service, and at the moment he is not helping this country.'  meanwhile, labour leader sir keir starmer said mr cummings 'broke the rules' and claimed the prime minister's 'unwillingness or inability to do the right thing has left the government looking untrustworthy, unprincipled'.  writing in the daily mirror, he said the government had 'undermined the very public health advice that is necessary to keep us all safe, just to keep one powerful aide in his job'.  'in times like this, we need good government. a government that we can trust. a government that is entirely focused on saving lives.  'so, i say to the prime minister: we cannot go on like this. we cannot lose another week to this farce. we need to get back on track.'  what is the nhs test and trace system?  the nhs test and trace system will see anyone who develops covid-associated symptoms told to self-isolate and get tested.  the close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease will then be told to quarantine for 14 days - even if they test negative and are not sick.  boris johnson's government has hired an enormous army of 50,000 people who will attempt to make this huge undertaking possible.  around 25,000 are contact tracers who will contact people who return positive coronavirus tests to grill them on their movements and their known associates.  the idea is to build a picture of who they have come into contact with and so who might be at risk of a) becoming ill and b) passing it on to more people.  another 25,000 people in the scheme are testers, who will go out into the community and test these known associates.  either way, these known associates will be under orders to immediately quarantine, even if the tests they return are negative.  baroness dido harding, executive chairwoman of nhs test and trace, said the scheme was central to easing the lockdown further.  she said: 'nhs test and trace is designed to enable the vast majority of us to be able to get on with our lives in a much more normal way.  'we will be trading national lockdown for individual isolation if we have symptoms.  'instead of 60 million people being in national lockdown, a much smaller number of us will be told we need to stay at home, either for seven days if we are ill or 14 days if we have been in close contact.'  the tracers can track down the contacts of 10,000 people per day.  how exactly will the nhs test and trace system work?  the uk's coronavirus tracing programme will be split into two parts.  part one:  people will be ordered to self-isolate for seven days if they develop symptoms. anyone in the same household will have to do the same.  those people should then order a coronavirus test online or by calling 119. this will be available for residents in wales from saturday.  if a test is positive, that victim must complete seven days in isolation. if the test comes back negative, no one needs to self-isolate.  however, people with a positive test for covid-19 will then be contacted via text message or email or by phone and told to answer questions.  they will be asked to share phone numbers and email addresses for close contacts.  for those under 18, they will receive a call from the team and a parent or guardian must give permission for the call to continue.  part two:  people who have been listed as a person with whom a coronavirus victim has had close contact will receive a text message or an email.  they will then be asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days based on when they last came into contact with that person.  other household members do not need to self-isolate unless symptoms are present.  if they develop covid-associated symptoms, all other household members should self-isolate and they should then order a test.  if the test is positive, self-isolation must continue for seven days. if the test is negative, that person should still complete 14 days in case the virus is not showing.  where do i get a coronavirus test?  anyone with coronavirus symptoms - a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste - can now apply to get tested for the infection through the nhs.  officials offer brits with tell-tale symptoms the chance to either test themselves at home, or to get swabbed at a drive-through centre.  the test involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud.  anyone going to get tested must drive themselves, or be taken to their local site by someone they live with to prevent unnecessarily spreading the virus.  the nhs says you can take up to three other people you live with to be tested at the same time.  home-tests - which involve you taking the swab yourself - are sent through the post and should arrive within 24 hours.  officials admit the test is best taken within five days of symptoms starting, and say that you may not get a test if you apply because of supply issues.  essential workers, such as nhs or social care staff, apply to be tested on a different government-run website.  how long will it be before i know if i have the coronavirus?  the aim of the scheme is to get all test results processed and returned within 24 hours but it is unlikely to hit that goal right at the start of the rollout.  that means some people could face lengthy waits to find out if they have tested positive, potentially delaying the tracing process and allowing the virus to spread.  baroness harding said of the test timings so far: 'yesterday, the turnaround time of our tests - we returned 84 per cent of all tests in our drive-in centres within 24 hours.  'and 95 per cent of all tests within 48 hours. i still don't think that's good enough. it's got to get better and better.'  who is a 'close contact'?  a close contact is anyone who has been within two metres (6ft 6in) of the infected person for more than 15 minutes without protective equipment.  the government hopes the requirements of the system will focus the minds of the public on the importance of maintaining social distancing.  when the coronavirus app is up and running, the victim's mobile phone should automatically identify anyone they have come close to.  until that happens, patients will identify likely contacts via an online process.  what about scotland, wales and northern ireland?  scotland has announced its own system will start today.  wales' system is set to start in early june, while northern ireland has its own version of the nhs test and trace system up and running.  can i choose where to isolate if i have a small child?  the government is encouraging people not to follow the example of boris johnson's aide dominic cummings, who travelled to durham during lockdown.  officials want people to stay at home, while councils will offer support to parents who do not have relatives or friends who can help.  a mailonline chart explains how the new nhs test and trace system is expected to work  the nhs test and trace system will be launched as the coronavirus death toll rises to 37,257  are there any pitfalls? if so, what are they?  yes there are pitfalls. this scheme has been cobbled together as quickly as possible by ministers and officials working under extreme pressure.  experts immediately said the complexity of the programme meant there could be 'several points of failure' while the government's political opponents said ministers should never have largely ditched contact tracing in the first place.  without the app, contact-tracking will be based on the say so of people who have tested positive. that means people will need to remember exactly where they have been and who they have been close in the days leading up to their positive test.  if people forget or remember inaccurately who they've seen, the virus could spread.  baroness harding told the downing street briefing: 'we have 25,000 contact tracers ready to start work tomorrow - that is easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown.'  she said data from the isle of wight suggests people have been within two metres of fewer than five others at the moment.  how important is contact tracing to beating coronavirus?  the royal society believes that contact tracing reduces infection by up to 15 per cent and will miss cases, but even a marginal effect could be crucial in bringing the r infection rate below one and as close to zero as possible.  what happens if people refuse to isolate? will they be fined?  the government has said that it is relying on the british public to voluntarily self-isolate if they display symptoms of covid-19.  but it has warned that it will impose penalties if people do not follow its orders. spot checks could be made to households and fines could be issued.  it is not known how much people would be fined if caught flouting self-isolation.  a spokesman for the department of health and social care told mailonline: 'we are confident that the public will want to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus to keep themselves, their families and communities safe and to protect the nhs. this means complying with advice to self-isolate.  'however, if we find that people are not complying with isolation instructions, we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're at home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house.'  at yesterday's press conference, health secretary matt hancock said the government is 'confident' that when told to self-isolate, people will, adding: 'now of course we could also mandate that, but in the first instance we're not going to.  'this will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing.  'but, we can quickly make it mandatory if that is what it takes. because, if we don't collectively make this work, then the only way forward is to keep the lockdown.'  could people end up having to self-isolate repeatedly?  yes. the government has discussed imposing 'local lockdowns' on whole towns if there are future regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases.  mr hancock said that the ability to tighten restrictions i"
health,"it's 'not safe' to reopen all schools next week and could lead to a surge in coronavirus cases, experts have today warned.  a panel of scientists, set up to challenge decisions made by ministers, fear the move to reopen schools in england on june 1 goes against scientific advice and 'jumps the gun'.  pushing classrooms to return will undoubtedly see the r levels raise and could risk a surge of cases in some communities, the report by the 'independent sage' warned.  delaying schools reopening to june 15 approximately halves the risk that a child will catch covid-19, they said.  in any situation, the chances a child would die are extremely low. but children have the ability to transmit the virus to adults, such as teachers or parents.  and they claimed an aggressive test, trace and track programme which works on a local level would limit spread of the virus when schools reopen.  but head of nhs test and trace, baroness dido harding, said the local element will not be fully in place until the end of june.  independent sage, set up to challenge decisions made by ministers, said delaying a school reopening to june 15 approximately halves the risk that a child will be infected and it would be almost impossible by september  the uk government’s position is that schools in england should reopen from 1st june to pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6. it's provoked a mixed response with huge criticism from teaching unions. pictured: headteacher elaine bradley in a rearranged classroom at slaithwaite c of e junior and infant school in slaithwaite, near huddersfield  independent sage revealed the impact of opening schools on the chances a child under the age of ten would get infected in the coming weeks. the average number of children who catch the virus in a 400-children class are represented in this diagram  independent sage was created when the official sage (scientific advisory group for emergencies) faced criticism for its lack of transparency in advice given to the government.  in its latest report, the committee looked over the official sage reports which helped inform decisions on when schools should return.  sage modelled what would happen in seven different scenarios, all of which result in the ‘r’ rate increasing.  the r rate is how many people one infected person transmits the virus to. if it is 3, it means 10 people would pass it on to 30 more, and so on.  the most recent estimates for the uk are that r is between 0.7-1, and sage warned last week the uk was on the brink of surpassing 1.  an r rate above 1 would cause cases to spiral uncontrollably - and sage says this would happen in any given scenario of schools returning.  how bad the situation became would depend entirely on the location, including how many tests were available and whether test, track and trace was running properly.  where there are ongoing new infections within the community, evidence suggests that reopening schools could increase the spread of the virus by up to 0.3 on the r value.  the independent sage report said: 'the school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by sage making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain. robust testing systems are not in place everywhere.  'additionally, public adherence to social distancing is influenced by trust in the government and its messaging.  'this trust is increasingly strained. we therefore believe that by going ahead with a general school reopening from 1 june, the government is not following the advice of its sage group and is risking a new surge in cases of covid19 in some communities.'  sir david king, a former government chief scientific adviser who chairs independent sage, said the government were 'jumping the gun'.  head teacher frances swallow (r) works with teaching assistant sarah yates (l) tries to create a safe teaching environment at marsden infant and nursery school in marsden  teaching assistant sarah yates applies tape to the floor to define a 2m boundary around the teacher's workspace  he told the independent: 'whilst we totally understand the imperative to get the nation’s children back in the classroom as soon as it is safe to do so, the evidence clearly shows that the government has jumped the gun here.  danger of coronavirus to children is low, scientists say the government's sage experts have suggested children are at low danger from coronavirus - and warned the 'shock' of school closures are blighting a generation. although the scientific advisory group on emergencies admit there is no certainty, a raft of papers suggest that children are less likely to be infected and infectious than adults, and teachers do not seem at heightened risk. the documents, prepared in the weeks up to may 1, float the idea of splitting classes in half and having children attend schools alternate weeks, saying that could slash the effect on the coronavirus 'r' number. unions insisted the sage evidence, published before prime minister boris johnson confirmed schools would be opening on june 1, was 'inconclusive' and demanded delay. chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance has said reopening schools was likely to push the r rate up. but he stressed that was the case for any change to lockdown, and schools were 'not a high risk area for r'. speaking at the downing street press briefing on may 22, sir patrick said coronavirus was a 'long term epidemic' and 'schools have to get back for education for our young people at some point' sir patrick said: 'the risk for children (from coronavirus) is much lower - we know that. 'they are at low risk but not zero risk and there have been some serious cases of children, of course, but very few compared to adults and older age groups. 'the broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you introduce any contact, you put pressure on the r and you put pressure on numbers, and that's true of anything we are going to do in terms of changes to contact.' eminent statistician sir david spiegelhalter said the risk of coronavirus to children is 'unbelievably low' and claimed children carry just a fraction of the viral load compared to adults, which significantly reduces their ability to fall ill or infect others. he pointed out that just one out of 7million children aged four to 14 in england and wales has died from covid-19. professor spiegelhalter said that at least one child had died from a rare inflammatory illness linked to coronavirus, but reassured parents that the risk of the complication would now be 'much lower now the epidemic in the community is under control.' he also said data has also shown that teachers do not have a greater risk of becoming infected. advertisement  'crucially we conclude that the best way forward cannot be one size fits all, it requires localised case by case responses to ensure that the risk of flair ups is kept to a minimum.'  the report said 'robust testing and tracing procedures' will reduce the chance of infectious staff, parents, or children attending school.  decisions on schools reopening should be based on whether there is a well-functioning contact tracing system in place at a local level.  this means local councils are set up with all the right resources to deliver tests to people and monitor outbreaks in the area - without being overwhelmed.  it is important that timely information from these sources is available at the local level and can be accessed by head teachers, other teachers, and parents and children.  local public health services should collect data and notify head teachers when there is evidence of a local hotspot emerging, the report said.  'we have seen no compelling evidence that these conditions have so far been met across the country. until they are, it is not safe to open schools everywhere on june 1,' scientists warned.  baroness dido harding, who is heading up the nhs test and trace system, admitted to mps the scheme may not be ready on a local level until the end of june, labour mp ben bradshaw, who was in the call, claimed.  the uk government’s position is that schools in england should reopen from 1st june to pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6.  it's provoked a mixed response with huge criticism from teaching unions who fear for the safety of both children, teachers and their families who will face the risk of becoming infected after weeks in lockdown.  independent sage revealed the impact of opening schools on the chances a child under the age of ten would get infected in the coming weeks.  it used data from mathematical models which have mapped the spread of covid-19 in the uk and assumed the r number was below 1.  if a child returned to school on june 1, there is a 4.2 per cent chance they would come into contact with a classmate who has the coronavirus - four times what it would be if they stayed at home.  the risk halves if the child goes back to school on june 15, and is cut to 0.5 per cent if plans are pushed back to september.  the chances the child would actually catch the virus is very low in any given situation, and extremely low for death.  on june 1, there is a 1.5 per cent chance a child would catch the coronavirus and a 0.23 in a million chance they would die from it.  waiting two weeks would slash those odds by half to 0.76 per cent and 0.11 in a million chance, respectively.  to put this into perspective, the daily chance of being killed in a road traffic accident is about 0.074 per million, the team noted.  staying at home at all time points is about half as risky as going to school, but also means that children do not get the benefit of having face-to-face learning and seeing their friends, which is a key reason ministers want school to return.  the problem there in lies with the fact many children who become infected could still pass the virus onto other children and adults.  children are just as likely to catch the coronavirus as adults, current uk data suggests, but don't seem to be diagnosed often.  this is for two reasons - children to do not show the typical symptoms that adults to, if at all, and testing has only been recently expanded to children.  children may be less likely than adults to pass the virus to others based on how long they are infectious for, the report said.  whether or not a school classroom is the perfect environment for the virus to spread remains to be seen, but so far there has been no worrying evidence of this from the thousands of children of key workers who have been going to school during the pandemic.  the contact tracing system got running today, with an army of 25,000 call-handlers to identify primary contacts of covid-19 patients.  it's been launched without a much anticipated phone app which in theory will detect strangers who a covid-19 patient has been in close proximity to.  everyone who displays coronavirus symptoms will be asked to report themselves to ‘test and trace’ officials either online or through a new helpline.  their job will be to find, test and isolate these people and contact anyone who they have had close interactions with. family members, flatmates, partners and close contacts will be told to go into isolation for a fortnight even if they have no symptoms.  nhs chiefs have warned 'key bits' of the system are not yet operational and staff working behind the scenes said the site crashed."
health,"britons have been on an emotional rollercoaster during the coronavirus lockdown, from the high of initial isolation to the low of the prime minister going into hospital.  a study of more than 55,000 people found that the way they feel when they wake up in the morning has evolved as the lockdown has progressed.  researchers working with sleep tech firm simba used sleep and mood tracking data to shine a light on the emotional state of britons.  they found that while the mood changed depending on the news, sleep quality steadily declined and alcohol consumption increased as lockdown went on.  psychologist dr andy cope, said 'the exhausting highs and lows of dealing with the crisis are bound to have long-term effects on our mental health.'  a study of more than 55,000 people and their morning mood found that people have been through a volatile, evolving and phased mixture of emotions  simba found there were five emotional phases of lockdown, starting with the initial digestion phase and ending with a pandemic plateau, where everyone became resigned to the idea of lockdown and a 'new normal'.  the first phase started on march 21 and saw a dip in people's 'wake up moods'.  that was the day after boris johnson announced the details of the government response to slow the spread of coronavirus - including school closures, work from home measures, pubs and restaurants shutting and gyms no longer operating.  the second phase of the 'corona-coaster' of moods has been dubbed the 'fleeting high' by dr cope and his team.  this phase was when the mood of the nation soared momentarily to a level above pre-covid 19 norms, say researchers, happening a week after lockdown.  this surge in positivity started on march 24, the day after lockdown was announced, with the country experiencing a brief 'euphoria, similar to the kind you might experience when you put the out of office on before a break', they wrote.  this happened as the nation processed not having to go into the office, spending more time with their family and not waking up so early - at least for a while.  'denial is the first stage of dealing with grief. it helps us minimise the overwhelming pain of loss,' explained dr cope.  researchers working with sleep tech firm simba used sleep and mood tracking data to shine a light on the emotional state of britons in lockdown. stock image of person working from home  the research team found there was a dip in the quality of sleep over the course of lockdown, reaching a low at the end of april  cope, who is the uk's first 'dr of happiness', believes the spike might be attributed to a perceived 'work from home utopia'.  he said people were finally getting the opportunity to unwind and sleep better after one of the most extraordinary weeks in the history of britain.  the happiness psychologist suggests the momentary lift could also be a reflection of the government's more purposeful approach to the virus.  at this point they were feeling a sense of hope that the country was dealing with the issue, and the virus would soon be eradicated as people sought solace in the safety of our own homes.  five stages of lockdown mood: from high to low to resignation digestion phase (march 21) lockdown approaches fleeting height (march 24) a week into working from home honeymoon ends (march 28) reality of lockdown sets in reality bites (april 4) rock bottom as pm admitted to hospital pandemic plateau (april 8) people are resigned to lockdown advertisement  there appeared to be some link between a spike in mood and government announcements from the daily briefings.  another short-lived spike emerged on april 1 the day after stephen powis, the national medical director of nhs england, said latest figures showed 'green shoots' of recovery in the coronavirus pandemic as infections slowed down for the first time.  the third phase of lockdown emotions is called 'honeymoon's over' - that is a dramatic slump in mood as brits began to realise the harsh realities of working from home, possibility of being furloughed or even redundancy risks.  the brief 'honeymoon period' came to a swift end as we were dealt a series of devastating blows between march 25 and march 31.  this included the news the prince of wales, boris johnson, matt hancock and chris whitty all contracting coronavirus or showing symptoms.  'wake-up moods were certainly more erratic during the first two weeks of lockdown,' said dr cope.  'the data also reveals a notable drop in sleep quality from march 23' compared to the same period of time before that date - of 12 per cent.  at this point we entered a phase known as 'reality hits', resulting in a major slump in mood as the prime minister was admitted to st thomas' hospital on april 5.  this left the country feeling 'rudderless' explains dr cope, as the nation descended towards rock bottom.  the queen's speech, in which she was said to invoke the 'spirit of the blitz', failed to have the desired effect, according to the simba team.  in fact it had the opposite effect as following the speech the mood of the nation took a dip - it reinforced that the situation was indeed very serious.  april 7 was by far and away the lowest point during the lockdown for brits moods.  interestingly, the data shows alcohol consumption dropped around this time, with the nation effectively 'sobering up' to the situation.  'pre-covid, mental health statistics were running at an alarming rate,' said cope.  'england consumed 75 million anti-depressant prescriptions in 2019, depression directly affected one in four and indirectly affected almost everyone, with anxiety, stress and panic on the rise,' he said.  'worse still, the effects were coming down the age groups so mental ill-health was becoming normalised in childhood.  'then came lockdown, social distancing, furlough, social isolation and a redefinition of ""normal"".  'official data on depression and anxiety will come through in due course.  psychologist dr andy cope, said 'the exhausting highs and lows of dealing with the crisis are bound to have long term effects on our mental health.  they tracked the sleep quality, wake up mood and alcohol consumption of the nation over the course of lockdown. people's moods were on a rollercoast, sleep quality steadily declined and alcohol consumption increased as lockdown went on  'anecdotal evidence suggests there will be huge mental health issues and this data gives some useful early indicators of how the nation's mood swings have mirrored the major news headlines.'  cope said living through covid-19 is stressful, not just from the fact the virus is deadly - but also the emotional turmoil the change in situation can have.  'the virus is contagious,' said cope, 'but so too are human emotions as we're wired for social connection.'  brits are currently in their ninth week of being cooped up with our nearest and dearest and this is a long time to be in such close proximity, even with loved ones.  'irritation can creep in. the buddhists have a phrase 'vipasanna vendetta', which translates as 'when tiny little irritations become full blown anger,' said cope.  'we get irritated by the little things like noisy eating, a silly giggle, a clicking pen... and we end up raising our voice and having silly arguments over next to nothing.  the brief 'honeymoon period' came to a swift end as we were dealt a series of devastating blows between march 25 and march 31. this included the news the prince of wales, boris johnson, matt hancock and chris whitty all contracting coronavirus or showing symptoms  'mirror neurons allow us to understand others and to 'tune in' or get on someone else's wavelength.  'this transference of human emotions forms the basis of empathy, so the bottom line is your wellbeing is crucial, not only for you but for those around you.'  we are currently in a stage that cope calls the pendemic emotional plateau, basically we've become resigned to the new normal.  april 8 marked the turning point as the highs and lows continued, but in a less pronounced manner, reflecting more acceptance of the situation.  although our mood rose, it didn't recover fully, instead running at levels slightly lower than they were during life pre-covid-19, cope confirmed.  the highs and lows throughout this period could be attributed to reports the pm's condition was 'improving' in intensive care on april 8.  the imf chief's grim global financial forecast on april 9 set us back again as did the april 16, briefing by foreign secretary dominic raab when he confirmed lockdown measures would be extended for another few weeks.  'despite the feeling that days are rolling into one, the data did reveal people are still treating weekends as the main time to drink,' said cope.  the weekend spikes of alcohol consumption before lockdown, continued after march 23 and it has risen gradually since lockdown.  our sleep quality has become worse than it was before lockdown.  andy cope, who is the uk's first 'dr of happiness', says the pandemic and lockdown could leave a lasting mental health problem for the uk  the queen's speech, in which she was said to invoke the 'spirit of the blitz', failed to have the desired effect, according to the simba team  'when you drink alcohol, your body creates chemicals aldehydes and ketones. aldehydes block the brain's ability to generate rem sleep,' cope said.  'rem-sleep plays an important role in accurate recognition and comprehension. thus, good sleep allows us to make more intelligent decisions.  'your wellbeing not only affects you but those around you. if you're feeling happy, your friends will be 14 per cent happier,' he said.  a happy brother or sister makes you 17 per cent happier and a happy neighbour improves your happiness by a whopping 34 per cent, the team found.  'improving your sleep hygiene is the smallest change you can make that will have the biggest impact on your wellbeing,' cope claims.  'if you can't be bothered to improve your sleep habits for yourself, upgrade for those around you. become a better version of you. be that friend, be that sibling, be that neighbour.'  the simba sleep app, used by 55,000 people, provided the data for this study and it tracks biometric sleep patterns and asks questions about mood when people wake."
health,"advertisement  april was the deadliest month on record in england and wales, according to shocking official statistics released today that lay bare the true toll of the coronavirus crisis.  data shows 88,153 people died last month across the two countries - more than double the amount recorded last april (44,123) or before the outbreak spiralled out of control in february 2020 (43,653). the figure, released by the office for national statistics (ons), shows the arrival of covid-19 on british shores led to people dying at twice the rate they would in a normal month.  in london this effect was even worse, with startling figures showing the number of people who died in april was triple what it was in the same month last year.  counting people who had coronavirus listed as their official cause of death, the number of fatalities nationwide in april was 27,764. but experts say the true death toll of the infection is considerably higher because many patients will have been undiagnosed or their cause of death inaccurately recorded.  'excess deaths' have also emerged as an issue, with the pandemic leading to people dying of causes other than the virus because they couldn't get the same medical care they would have otherwise had access to.  the statistics come as a grim analysis by the financial times claims britain has suffered the highest excess death rate of any comparable country during the coronavirus pandemic.  it showed the 59,537 excess deaths counted since the outbreak began amounted to 891 deaths per million people. this was higher than any other country in western europe or the us, with italy at just below 800 per million.  the number of people dying in april each year has remained relative stable at around 40,000 or the last 13 years, but saw a massive spike to 88,000 this year as the coronavirus epidemic raged through the uk  the covid-19 pandemic doubled the rate of deaths from all causes in england and wales in april, data showed today. 8,180 people died as a direct result of the coronavirus during the worst week, from april 11 to 17  the ons statistics published today show the number of people who have died of any cause, month by month.  in january this year, 56,706 people died in england and wales, which was high but not unheard of for winter. that was followed by 46,653 in february and 49,723 in march.  april, however, brought a huge spike to 88,153 - 0.15 per cent of the entire population.  the first death from coronavirus in an nhs england hospital happened on march 2 and there were 3,857 during that month. there were 17,774 in april.  what have been the deadliest months on record? april 2020 was the month in which england and wales recorded more people's deaths, of any cause, than at any other point since current records began in 2006. it is the only month featuring in the worst 10 that has not been in the depths of winter - eight of the 10 were in january and one was in december. these are the 10 months which had the highest death tolls: april 2020: 88,153 people died january 2018: 64,154 january 2015: 60,891 january 2017: 57,368 january 2016: 56,706 january 2009: 55,045 january 2019: 53,910 december 2008: 53,594 january 2013: 52,898 january 2008: 52,057 advertisement  regionally the biggest increase in deaths between april last year and april this year happened in london, where it rose 197 per cent from 4,102 to 12,175.  it also more than doubled in the west midlands, which is centred around birmingham, from 4,527 to 9,932 (119 per cent).  and in the north west, including lancashire, cumbria and manchester, it rose by 112 per cent from 5,835 to 12,354.  other regions of the country saw substantial increases but their numbers less than doubled.  the absolute most deaths happened in the south east, which includes surrey, hampshire and kent, where 12,823 people died in april. this was a 90 per cent increase on 6,765 people in april 2019.  some areas were hit significantly harder than others, the data shows, with the london borough of haringey experiencing the biggest rise in deaths between april 2019 and 2020. fatalities there rose from just 80 in april 2019 to 353 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic - a surge of 341 per cent.  newham, in east london, also recorded a more than four-fold rise in deaths, increasing 328 per cent from 95 to 407.  nine out of 10 of the areas with the biggest increases in people dying were in london - haringey (341 per cent), newham (328 per cent), brent (289 per cent), enfield (257 per cent), lewisham (255 per cent), waltham forest (248 per cent), barnet (243 per cent), redbridge (243 per cent) and harrow (239 per cent).  third worst after newham was hertsmere in hertfordshire, where the number of deaths rose from 70 to 278 (297 per cent).  an analysis by the financial times has suggested that the uk has the highest rate of death in the western world since the coronavirus outbreak started.  it calculated the number of excess deaths per million people to work out the impact the pandemic has had both on people who caught the virus themselves and who died as a secondary effect.  there have also have been extra deaths among people who were afraid or unable to go to hospital, or because patients had treatment delayed by overloaded hospitals.  the ft found britain has had 891 extra deaths per million during the pandemic, compared to fewer than 800 for italy, the second worst ranked country, and 200 per million in the us.  the us has the highest number of total deaths of anywhere in the world, with more than 100,000 people now dead because of covid-19. britain's toll is second worst, with an official count of 37,460. the true number is expected to rise above 50,000 when death certificate data has been collected for may.  analysis by the financial times claims britain has suffered the highest excess death rate of any comparable country during the coronavirus pandemic  four out of 10 deadliest weeks on record happened in april four of the 10 deadliest weeks ever recorded in england and wales occurred in april 2020, statistics show. the 10 deadliest ever weeks in england and wales, since ons records began week ending 17/04/2020 24/04/2020 07/01/2000 08/01/1999 10/01/1997 10/04/2020 01/05/2020 14/01/2000 03/01/1997 17/01/1997 number of deaths 22,351 21,997 20,566 20,116 18,541 18,516 17,953 17,776 17,646 16,652  britain's devastating statistics come as the country is today moving into the next phase of its loosening of lockdown. the government has launched its 'test and trace' service which will now monitor the virus's spread.  an approach that was abandoned in the second week of march when officials realised the virus was out of control, test and trace will make sure everyone with symptoms gets tested and, if they test positive, government workers will track down everyone they have been in contact with and tell them to self-isolate for two weeks.  the nhs test and trace system for england went live today at 9am for people who have covid-associated symptoms. these include a high temperature, a new cough, or a changed sense of taste or smell.  it was unveiled yesterday by health secretary matt hancock, who said it was the 'civic duty' of the public to adhere to the new rules.  however, it has been launched without its nhs contact tracing app centrepiece, prompting concerns that without the new technology the government could struggle to tackle the spread of the disease.  experts immediately said the complexity of the programme meant there could be 'several points of failure' while the government's political opponents said ministers should never have largely ditched contact tracing in the first place.  under the nhs test and trace plans, anyone with symptoms will immediately self-isolate and book a test, either at a testing centre or delivered to their home. their household should start a 14-day isolation period too.  if the test proves negative, everyone comes out of isolation. but if the test is positive, nhs contact tracers or local public health teams will call, email or send a text asking them to share details of the people they have been in close contact with and places they have visited.  the contact tracing website appeared to crash early this morning, falling at the first hurdle as staff complained it had been a 'complete shambles'.  doctors and other staff reported major teething troubles as the much-trumpeted scheme finally got up and running, with some saying they had not even received passwords to start work - although the public-facing web forms were not affected.  meanwhile, nhs chiefs have warned that 'key bits' of the system are not yet operational and it cannot be described as 'world class'.  the chaotic beginning came as matt hancock laughed off criticism over the delay to the nhs app that was meant to accompany the regime.  the health secretary insisted it was right to press ahead without the phone technology, suggesting it was important to 'get people used' to the principles."
health,"even people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus develop antibodies, according to a study that raises hopes that survivors do get immunity.  researchers analysed the blood of 160 medics who all had a mild form of covid-19 and had not needed hospital care.  they found 99.4 per cent of the group had antibodies to the virus 13 days after their symptoms, which signals they have some form of protection against it.  the antibodies had the ability to 'neutralise' - or kill - the virus in tests, and appeared to grow stronger in the weeks after infection.  the study did not look at blood samples any later than 40 days after symptoms, so it was not established how long antibodies last for.  antibodies are a sign a person was infected by the coronavirus. but whether or not this protects a survivor from being re-infected has yet to be proven.  several countries, including the uk, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work with so-called 'immunity passports'.  but the unsolved question regarding immunity has halted this idea and become one of the most contested issues during the pandemic.  the french study comes after previous research revealed that mild covid-19 patients have such low levels of antibodies they are barely detectable, which could mean they are often missed by antibody tests, or that person has weak immunity.  a french study has shown even people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus develop antibodies, raising hope of immunity. pictured: women shopping in face masks in paris  the latest study was conducted at the pasteur institute, in paris, where researchers screened the blood of 160 medics who had confirmed covid-19  the latest study was conducted at the pasteur institute, in paris. the findings, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have been published on medrxiv.  blood samples were taken from more than 160 staff at two hospitals in strasbourg, eastern france, who became infected with covid-19 early in march.  the cluster emerged after a 'super-propagation' event – linked to a five-day prayer and fasting gathering of the evangelical christian open door church in mulhouse, 70 miles (114km) from strasbourg.  participants - doctors, nurses, dentists and other medics - were 32 years old on average, and anyone who was severely sick with the disease had been removed from the study.  the researchers wanted to focus on patients with mild disease because there is little known about their immunity even though they make up to 80 per cent of cases, according to the world health organisation.  two separate antibody tests were used to look for antibodies. the first test was a commercially available one, which generally are less accurate.  the second test had been developed by the institute to identify antibodies, and the ability of those antibodies to neutralise the virus.  every recovered covid-19 patients develops antibodies - but they may not block the infection again most people who recover from the novel coronavirus generate at least some antibodies capable of neutralizing sars-cov-2, the first round of results from a new study suggest. while many antibodies grab hold of the virus, only a few counteract the pathogen and prevent it from entering our cells. researchers from rockefeller university in new york city looked at 149 recovered patients and determined that the majority had a weak antibody response. however, they found that every patient's immune system seemed to be capable of generating the types of antibodies that neutralize the virus, just not particularly enough of them. 'this suggests just about everybody can do this, which is very good news for vaccines,' dr michel c nussenzweig, head of the laboratory of molecular immunology at rockefeller, said in a statement. 'it means if you were able to create a vaccine that elicits these particular antibodies, then the vaccine is likely to be effective and work for a lot of people.' for the study, published on pre-peer review site biorxiv.org, the team looked at 149 people who donated plasma at the rockefeller hospital in new york city over the course of five weeks. convalescent plasma is the liquid portion of blood is taken from a recovered coronavirus patient, which contains antibodies and immune b-cells. participants had symptoms of the virus for about 12 days while infected, and their first symptoms occurred about 39 days before they donated plasma. researchers then mixed the plasma with a pseudo coronavirus and measured if or how well the virus would infect human cells in a petri dish. most samples did not do very well at neutralizing the virus. in fact, the neutralizing effect was undetectable in 33 per cent of donors. the investigators say this may be because their immune systems cleared the infection before antibodies could be produced. they found that the effect was very high among one percent of patients, so-called 'elite donors.' the team identified 40 antibodies that neutralized the virus, and focused on three that did so even at low levels. these antibodies bound to at least three sites on the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus that it uses to enter our cells. researchers now plan to clone these antibodies in hopes it will help patients with severe or life-threatening cases of the virus. 'we now know what an effective antibody looks like and we have found similar ones in more than one person,' robbiani said. advertisement  the first test, a rapid immunodiagnostic test, detected antibodies in 153 (95.6 per cent) of the samples.  the more robust test found antibodies in 159 (99.4 per cent) volunteers. it failed to detect antibodies in a 58-year-old man.  when looking at the antibodies' ability to neutralise the virus, they appeared to grow stronger over time.  neutralizing antibodies - which bind to the virus and inactivate it, rather than 'tag' it for other immune cells - were found in 79 per cent of samples 13-20 days after symptoms started. this rose to 98 per cent after 28-41 days.  'it is a fair assumption that the majority of individuals with mild covid-19 generate neutralising antibodies within a month after onset of symptoms,' olivier schwartz, one of the leading researchers, told the french newspaper le monde.  'the neutralising activity is present much later than the appearance of antibodies and this is encouraging.  'although not yet demonstrated, several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of neutralising antibodies may be associated with protective immunity for sars-cov-2 infection.'  survivors of sars, a coronavirus related to this one that died out in early 2000, have been found to have antibodies that are protective for two years.  the evidence that mild covid-19 patients elicit the production of antibodies has not always been positive. some research has shown only patients with really severe disease develop antibodies, which may mean those who had mild forms are still vulnerable to infection again.  a study of a similar size at rockefeller university in new york city, published this week, also found that every patient's immune system seemed to be capable of generating the types of antibodies that neutralize the virus - but sometimes in very weak amounts.  for the study, published on pre-peer review site biorxiv.org, the team looked at 149 people who donated blood plasma - which would contain antibodies.  researchers then mixed the plasma with the spike protein of sars-cov-2 - which coats the virus - and measured if or how well the virus would infect human cells in a petri dish.  most samples, which were collected 39 days after symptoms on average, did not do very well at neutralizing the virus.  in fact, the neutralizing effect was undetectable in 33 per cent of donors. the investigators say this may be because their immune systems cleared the infection before antibodies could be produced.  antibodies are only one part of the picture - there are other parts of the immune system which are triggered by the virus, including t cells.  health officials in several countries, including the uk, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work.  but getting the ball rolling on antibody testing has been a fiasco, not only because the science on immunity is full of holes, but because there have been obstacles in finding a test with enough reliability.  most antibody tests are fraught with inaccuracies, giving an incorrect result, which can be dangerous.  yesterday the centers for disease control found antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time, and warned testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions.  nhs workers in the uk were confirmed to be getting antibody testing this week after a deal to buy 10million tests from manufacturers roche and abbott.  these were planned to be rolled out to the public soon after - but there are concerns this will not go ahead.  health officials have banned people from buying the same tests online because they fear the results are too unreliable.  the ban affects superdrug and lloyds, which were just two companies offering the tests to people for a fee of £69 or more using the same equipment that are now being used for nhs staff.  the equipment is being used wrongly, officials say, because it takes blood from a finger prick sample - not someone's veins, as been approved by the government.  there has been no rapid home testing kit - which someone reads results on like a pregnancy stick - approved for use in the uk by health chiefs, despite promises back in march.  another testing shambles: health chiefs ban public from buying the same antibody test they are rolling out for nhs workers  sam blanchard, senior health reporter for mailonline  health officials have banned people from buying at-home coronavirus antibody tests that use finger-prick blood samples because they fear the results are so unreliable.  the ban affects superdrug, which is offering to test people for past infection with covid-19 using the same equipment that are now being used for nhs staff.  the equipment is being used wrongly, officials say, because it only has government approval when used with blood taken directly from someone's veins, not their finger. using the wrong type of blood sample makes it less reliable.  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra), which polices medicines and medical devices in the uk told firms and labs offering to test blood samples people take themselves to 'temporarily stop providing this service', warning they would take 'enforcement action' if businesses failed to abide by the rule.  but health chiefs were today accused of 'making the rules up as they go', with critics calling the decision another failure in britain's testing fiasco, which has seen months of delays and wasted money in the bid to find near-perfect tests.  public health england officials last week approved the first two antibody tests, made by pharmaceutical giants abbott and roche, which both claim their machines and procedure are almost 100 per cent accurate when used with blood from a vein.  the nhs scheme – which began on monday and is reserved for frontline workers – uses samples of blood taken by a needle in the vein collected by a nurse or a doctor, which are sent to a lab for testing and close to 100 per cent accurate.  private firms jumped on phe's approval of those testing processes earlier this month to start selling their own tests, such as superdrug - which quickly sold out of their £69 tests when they went on sale on wednesday.  confusingly, the lab-based equipment used to process the now-banned tests is the same as for the national scheme, but must be used in a certain way.  the decision by the mhra - a branch of the department of health - only concerns tests which rely on people taking their own blood from their finger, not ones which use professional samples of vein blood.  it is unclear how many of these have been sold already but it is understood to affect thousands of people. superdrug admitted only that it had received 'strong demand' for its tests.  sources say officials only became aware of the antibody tests being used this way in the past few days - even though private firms across britain have been selling blood kits for weeks online, some for more than £100 a time.  antibody tests involve taking blood and looking for signs of past infection, which is indicated by the presence of antibodies from the immune system. scientists have yet to prove this confers any form of immunity.  abbott, the manufacturer of the test being used by superdrug, is furious that its tests are being used with self-sampled blood, which was not its intended use. it has sold 800,000 of the tests to the nhs already.  it is not believed to be linked to a report issued yesterday by the us's centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), which suggested that even highly accurate antibody tests may be wrong up to 50 per cent of the time when used for an uncommon virus.  abbott, one of the manufacturers of a government validated test which is being used by superdrug, is furious that its tests are being used with self-sampled blood, which was not its intended use. it has sold 800,000 of the tests to the nhs already  the highest performing antibody tests use high-tech machinery to try to produce a reaction between a blood sample and a part of the virus to see whether the person's immune system contains the substances needed to fight off the virus. pictured: the architect laboratory instrument that abbott uses for its coronavirus test  superdrug has said it will offer refunds to customers who bought its at-home tests.  the high street retailer launched its service only a week ago - it had to stop selling them early because of overwhelming demand but has now been stopped in its tracks.  a superdrug spokesperson told mailonline this evening: 'we have contacted all our covid-19 antibody testing service customers today to provide further information about the quality and safety of our covid-19 antibody laboratory-based testing service.  'our doctors continue to support our customers with interpreting and understanding their results. if a customer requests a refund then we will organise it for them.'  the mhra has confirmed that it has the power to force companies to stop using the test - which it described as 'non-compliance' - if it needs to.  it said in a statement: 'when we find instances of non-compliance, in the first instance, we act swiftly to ensure voluntary cooperation.  'in this case, service providers have voluntarily paused their services following discussions with the mhra. we would only move to formal enforcement action where voluntary compliance was not successful.'  dr simon clarke, a cellular microbiology expert at the university of reading, said taking the decision to block the testing this late in the day was ‘really odd’.  at least half a dozen companies have already bought antibody tests and are selling them en masse to members of the public, many of whom are now unable to get results despite having paid for a private service.  dr clarke said the government was probably panicking that people receiving positive antibody results might believe they were immune to covid-19 and get brave about breaking lockdown rules.  he told mailonline: 'this is really odd. at least one of the tests validated by the government is commercially available.  'why they’re telling people not to use them; they don’t want people to be assuming that they’ve had the virus and are immune.  britain's covid-19 testing shambles: a timeline march 12: professor chris whitty announced that widespread coronavirus testing of members of the public would come to an end. the outbreak was too large, officials have since admitted, and only hospital patients could be tested within capacity. march 19: boris johnson promised to get antibody tests 'as simple as a pregnancy test' available for people to use at home - this is still nowhere near a reality. march 25: public health england's sharon peacock said the uk had bought 3.5million antibody tests and was evaluating them with a view to getting them available 'within days' - they were all deemed useless and were never made available to the public. april 2: health secretary matt hancock sets ambitious aim of carrying out 100,000 coronavirus tests every day by the end of the month. on april 1 the government had done 10,412. april 3: universities and private labs caused uproar in the 'little ships' fiasco when they revealed the government had turned down their offers to help with swab testing, to check who had the disease at the time. april 16: the new york times reported that britain had spent £16.5million on antibody tests that it no longer wanted to use. may 1: health secretary matt hancock claimed the government hit its 100,000-a-day test target, but it emerged that it had just mailed out 39,000 of them on that day and many of those may never have been returned or analysed.  'them not wanting to think that way is probably right… but this should have been put to bed earlier.'  he said that taking the decision now shows 'a lack of foresight that getting it wrong could cause problems'.  at least two laboratories are known to have stopped processing as a result of the 'guidance' from the mhra.  professor karol sikora, a former world health organization cancer chief, took antibody testing into his own hands at the rutherford cancer centres where he is medical director.  he told this website: 'in britain the testing is appalling. there seems to be no strategy and it changes by the day. they're making it up as they go...  'it's another failure. we shouldn't have got to this point in the pandemic and not had a properly worked out testing strategy both for the virus and antibodies. it should have been sorted out at the beginning.'  the finger-prick tests have never been approved by the government because they use a different type of blood to that which official tests have been validated on.  in the lab the tests use blood taken directly from a patient's veins, while the home tests may use blood from capillaries, which are tiny vessels carrying oxygenated blood through the skin.  this blood, because it comes through a wound in the skin, is more likely to be contaminated by the time it reaches the test.  tissue fluid from parts of the body surrounding the blood vessels, or substances on the skin, may mix with the tiny amount of blood and make it more difficult for the test to filter it accurately.  taking the blood properly is key - for example, the first drop of blood should not be used for the above reason - and unqualified people might be less likely to get a clean sample if doing it by themselves.  are tests less reliable when finger blood is used? in the lab the tests use blood taken directly from a patient's veins, while the home tests may use blood from capillaries, which are tiny vessels carrying oxygenated blood through the skin. this blood, because it comes through a wound in the skin, is more likely to be contaminated by the time it reaches the test. tissue fluid from parts of the body surrounding the blood vessels, or substances on the skin, may mix with the tiny amount of blood and make it more difficult for the test to filter it accurately. taking the blood properly is key - for example, the first drop of blood should not be used for the above reason - and unqualified people might be less likely to get a clean sample if doing it by themselves. professor sikora added: 'the real problem is, if you've got this in the post and never done it before, the chances of you screwing it up are high - it's just the way these things are designed. 'and people are nervous about pricking their fingers anyway. so there's a lot of inconsistency.' the finger-prick samples also only use a tiny amount of blood - usually just one or two drops - meaning there is more chance of the antibodies being missed. testing of covid-19 patients has in the past revealed that some of them with the mildest illnesses have levels of antibodies in the blood that are so low they are barely detectable. using a pure, larger blood sample from a deeper vein could increase the ability to detect these.  professor sikora added: 'the real problem is, if you've got this in the post and never done it before, the chances of you screwing it up are high - it's just the way these things are designed.

'there are several uk providers of testing services who offer covid-19 antibody testing using a fingerprick sample of capillary blood collected in a small container.  'we are asking all providers of laboratory-based covid-19 antibody testing services using capillary blood collected by a fingerprick to temporarily stop providing this service until home collection of this sample type has been properly validated for use with these laboratory tests.  cdc warns antibody tests are wrong up to half the time antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time, according to updated information from the centers for disease control. the cdc now warns antibody testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions, as even with high test specificity, 'less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies'. it urges caution with the test results as many false positives could lead people to believe they have an immunity to coronavirus and act accordingly. health care providers may need to test patients at least twice to give a more accurate reading, the new guidance posted to the cdc website adds. antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it. there is currently a high level of inaccuracy in the testing, however, caused by how uncommon the virus is within the population. if the infection has affected only a small number of people tested, it will have a magnified margin of error, the cdc explains. it means that even a test with more than 90 per cent accuracy can still miss half the cases if only five percent of the population has been infected.  'use of unvalidated sample types may lead to unreliable results and as such we are working closely with the service providers, laboratories and test manufacturers to resolve the regulatory and patient safety issues.  'people who have purchased one of these sampling kits, and received an antibody test result, should not consider the result to be reliable and should not take any action on it.  'this does not affect rapid point of care tests or laboratory tests performed using venous blood.'  the way antibody tests work is that a blood sample is taken from a patient, either by medical professional or by themselves, and that is posted off to a lab.  there, qualified technicians analyse the blood to look for antibodies for the coronavirus, which are immune system substances created when someone is infected with the virus.  people then receive a result in which the presence of antibodies - a positive result - indicates they have already had the virus, or the absence that they have not.  the lab analysis stage is now being blocked by the mhra because the tests are being used with blood taken by the patient themselves.  the best-known company providing antibody tests, superdrug, voluntarily stopped issuing its tests last week because of immense demand, so it could get through all the ordered samples.  it did not confirm whether the mhra rule had affected its service.  a spokesperson said: 'we have been contacted by the mhra and are in ongoing discussions with them about covid-19 laboratory-based testing services and the updated guidance provided by abbott.  'we are also contacting all our covid-19 antibody testing service customers today to provide further information about the quality and safety of our covid-19 antibody laboratory-based testing service. we are updating them on our current position together with inviting them to contact us directly if they’d like further information or if they have any questions or concerns.  how can accurate tests be inaccurate? antibody tests with what could be considered a high level of accuracy can still produce large margins of error if only a small proportion of a population has been infected. a 95% specific test, for example, will always produce five false positive results from a group of 100 people. even if it is sensitive enough to detect all the people who have genuinely had the disease, it will still return five false positives, and the effect this has on the results of a survey can be large if the number of true positives is low. if the prevalence of antibodies is low - for example, only 5% of people in the group have had the illness - the results could end up half wrong. the 95% test, in that situation, would be expected to return 10 positives - five of them right, five of them wrong. this means the functional accuracy of the test, known as its true predictive value, is only around 50%. the effect of these false positives is magnified if the prevalence of the virus in the population is low, and less noticeable if the prevalence is high. for example, if 30% of the population have been infected, those five false positive results would be counter-balanced by 30 true positives, making the test more like 85 per cent accurate. a more specific test can reduce this effect; by comparison a 99.9% specific test would return one wrong result per thousand - 100 per million.  lloyds pharmacy is also believed to have been affected by the decision but did not confirm this.  andy sloman, a managing director at the company, said: 'we are working closely with our partners and regulators and have taken the decision to temporarily pause the lloydspharmacy online doctor covid-19 antibody testing service pending further guidance.  'the health and safety of customers is our top priority, particularly during such a difficult and uncertain time.  'we are following the developing advice and guidance on covid-19 antibody tests from the government and medical professionals closely.'  professor ian jones, a virologist at reading university, said: 'in general i am in favour of freedom of choice as long as there is full information given on the reliability of the test performed.  'after all, you can buy any number of totally useless products sold under the vitamin or ""immune health"" type banner and the government does nothing.  'it’s worth noting that part of germany’s success in dealing with the epidemic was because of a commercial testing drive, in that case for active infections.  'the problem with centralisation is that it cannot cope with the numbers and that any teething troubles affect all samples.  'a disseminated system at least avoids this. it seems to me the issue is lack of accurate information about which kits are acceptable and which providers are offering them. then people can choose.'  a department of health spokesperson said: 'the government is working to develop scalable solutions for at home antibody testing. our experts are clear that an unreliable test is worse than no test.  'we strongly discourage organisations and individuals purchasing their own unvalidated antibody tests.'"
health,"advertisement  health secretary matt hancock has announced that the uk's coronavirus contact tracing programme will finally launch this morning - with the members of the public being forced to isolate if they come into contact with positive individuals or face being fined.  the nhs test and trace system for england will see anyone who develops symptoms told to self-isolate and get tested, with the close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease then told to quarantine for 14 days even if they test negative and are not sick.  mr hancock said that adhering to self-isolation would be 'voluntary at first' but that he could 'quickly make it mandatory if that is what it takes'.  he told the daily downing street press conference: 'if you are contacted by nhs test and trace instructing you to isolate, you must. it is your civic duty, so you avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and you help to break the chain of transmission.'  the system is being launched without its nhs contact tracing app centrepiece prompting concerns that without the new technology the government could struggle to tackle the spread of the disease.  experts immediately said the complexity of the programme meant there could be 'several points of failure' while the government's political opponents said ministers should never have largely ditched contact tracing in the first place.  the launch of the programme was announced by boris johnson during an appearance in front of the liaison committee yesterday as he admitted the uk's testing capability was underpowered at the start of the outbreak because the 'brutal reality' was britain did not 'learn the lessons' of previous pandemics.  insisting self-isolation would only be an imposition for a 'tiny minority', he added: 'i would just say to everybody that it's worth it because that is the tool that other countries have used to unlock the prison.'  coronavirus testing eligibility was yesterday extended so that anyone with symptoms, even the under-fives, can now get checked. daily testing capacity is currently 161,000 but the latest numbers showed that only 117,000 were carried out yesterday while photographs showed some drive-through testing sites were empty.  the government is pinning its hopes of ending the nationwide lockdown on the success of the test and trace scheme but it will go live without the nhsx app which digitally records close contacts and will massively speed up the contact tracing process.  dido harding, executive chair of nhs test and trace, claimed the app is just the 'cherry on the cake, not the cake itself' but ministers had wanted the technology, currently being trialled on the isle of wight, to roll out nationwide in the middle of this month.  problems with its development have seen it delayed which means the new scheme will initially be entirely reliant on an army of 25,000 contact tracers to track people down and prevent a second wave of infections.  ms harding did concede that the rollout of the massive new system is unlikely to be straightforward as she said 'there will be some kinks, for sure' as experts warned the roll out could be bumpy.  professor linda bauld, professor of public health, university of edinburgh, said for it to work there would need to be sufficient testing capacity, fast results, confidence in the data handling and a willingness from people to self-isolate.  she said: 'given all these steps, we shouldn't expect that this will work perfectly and there could be several points of failure.'  jonathan ashworth, shadow health secretary, said the government should never have 'abandoned contact tracing in mid-march' and and that decision had left a 'huge gap in our defences against the virus'.  dido harding, executive chair of nhs test and trace, claimed the contact tracing app is just the 'cherry on the cake, not the cake itself'  a drive-through coronavirus testing centre was pictured empty at manchester airport as matt hancock announced anyone with symptoms can now get checked  mr hancock told the daily downing street press conference that test and trace could allow the nationwide lockdown to be eased  how nhs test and trace will work the nhs test and trace programme will be split into two parts. they are: part one step one: isolate. when someone gets symptoms they should self-isolate for seven days. anyone in the same household should do the same. step two: test. they should order a coronavirus test online or by calling 119. step three: results. if a test is positive they must complete seven days in isolation. anyone in the same household should complete 14 days. if it is negative no one needs to isolate. step four: contacts. people with a positive test will be contacted via text or email or by phone and told to answer questions and share phone numbers and email addresses for close contacts. part two - for people flagged as contacts step one: alert. people flagged will get a text or email. they will then be told what they need to do. step two: isolate. they will be asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days based on when they last came into contact with the person. other household members do not need to self-isolate unless symptoms are present. step three: test. if they develop symptoms all other household members should self-isolate. they should then order a test. if it is positive self-isolation must continue for seven days. if negative you must still complete 14 days in case the virus is not yet showing. advertisement  what happens if test and trace identifies a local outbreak? every local area will have a coronavirus action plan setting out what will happen if there is a localised spike in infections. the focus will be on containing the outbreak. if testing data shows there has been a localised spike in cases a public health investigation will be triggered to examine the circumstances and to immediately crackdown on it. local testing efforts will be stepped up to determine the extent of the spread and to make sure everyone who is infected is put into self-isolation. if the data suggests the outbreak is linked to a certain service or premises it will be shut and subject to deep cleaning before being allowed to reopen.  during mr johnson's appearance in front of the liaison committee he revealed:  the 'brutal reality' was the uk had not learned the lessons of previous pandemics and that was why testing capacity was not where it needed to be.  he said that while people will not initially be fined for failing to self-isolate ministers could move to introduce penalties later.  mr johnson flatly dismissed calls for an official inquiry into dominic cummings as he was grilled by senior mps, saying the outcry was just a 'political ding dong'.  the pm said he 'totally understood public indignation' about the row regarding his aide's trip to durham, but insisted some of the allegations about his chief aide were 'not correct' and urged people to 'move on'.  he said he hopes that the two-metre social distancing rule can be reduced and has asked scientists to review it as coronavirus is suppressed, in order to aid the return of public transport and the hospitality sector.  meanwhile, britain yesterday announced 412 more covid-19 deaths, taking the official number of victims to 37,460 - as nhs data showed more than half of trusts haven't recorded a fatality in the last 48 hours.  announcing the launch of the contact tracing scheme, mr johnson said the 'brutal reality' is that the uk did not learn the lessons of past pandemics in developing sufficient testing and tracing capacity.  responding to former health secretary jeremy hunt, the pm told the commons liaison committee: 'we did have a test, track and trace operation but unfortunately we did not have the capacity in public health england.  'to be absolutely blunt, we didn't have the enzymes, we didn't have the test kits, we just didn't have the volume, nor did we have enough experienced trackers ready to mount the kind of operation they did in some other east asian countries, for instance.  'and i think the brutal reality is this country didn't learn the lessons of sars or mers and we didn't have a test operation ready to go on the scale that we needed.'  speaking at the daily downing street press conference, mr hancock said testing and tracing will become a 'new way of life' as he announced anyone with symptoms can now access a check.  'as we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks,' he said.  'nhs test and trace will be vital to stopping the spread of the virus. it is how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our nhs.  'this new system will help us keep this virus under control while carefully and safely lifting the lockdown nationally.'  mr hancock said that adhering to self-isolation would be 'voluntary at first' but that he could 'quickly make it mandatory if that is what it takes' - a statement echoed by mr johnson at the liaison committee.  the new nhs test and trace scheme has an overall staff of approximately 50,000 people, comprising of 25,000 contact tracers, 20,000 people administering tests and between 4-7,000 clinicians who will provide expert advice.  boris johnson announced the launch of nhs test and trace during an appearance at the liaison committee. he told mps that the 'brutal reality is this country didn't learn the lessons of sars or mers and we didn't have a test operation ready to go on the scale that we needed'  the government hopes that it will soon have the capacity to test 200,000 people for coronavirus every day, using 50 drive-through sites, more than 100 mobile testing units and three so-called 'mega labs'.  the aim is for test results to be ready within 24 hours although officials have admitted it will take some time to hit that goal.  speed will be of the essence in avoiding a second wave of the disease with contact tracing working best when people who may have been exposed to infection are swiftly removed from society.  as of this morning, anyone who tests positive for coronavirus will be contacted by nhs test and trace and told to share information about their recent interactions, handing over phone numbers and email addresses of close contacts..  close contacts will be defined as anyone who has spent more than 15 minutes at a distance of less than two metres with someone who has subsequently tested positive.  what are the pitfalls of the nhs test and trace scheme? 1. it is launching without the nhsx contact tracing app. experts believe the app will be crucial to the success of the programme because it can identify contacts much quicker than human contact tracers. the smartphone app uses bluetooth to register other phones it has been near for a prolonged period of time. a date has not been set for the nationwide roll out of the app but without it contact tracing will not be as swift as it would be with it. 2. it is entirely reliant on human testimony without the app the tracking down of contacts will be based on the say so of people who have tested positive. that means people will need to remember exactly where they have been and who they have been close in the days leading up to their positive test. if people forget or simply remember inaccurately who they have seen it could risk the virus spreading. 3. self-isolating will be voluntary when the scheme launches it will not come with the threat of penalties or fines for people who do not comply with the request to stay at home. however, mr johnson made clear that minister could later impose penalties if people do not play by the rules. 4. it is unclear exactly who will be in charge of tackling localised outbreaks councils and public health officials will be tasked with cracking down on local spikes in infection but it was not immediately clear who will lead those efforts, how many staff members would be available to help or if local authorities will get extra funding and powers to act appropriately. 5. test results could take longer than 24 hours the aim of the scheme is to get all test results processed and returned within 24 hours but it is unlikely to hit that goal right at the start of the rollout. that means some people could face lengthy waits to find out if they have tested positive, potentially delaying the contact tracing process and allowing the virus to spread.  people identified as having been in close contact will then be told to stay at home for 14 days even if they do not have symptoms to stop unknowingly spreading the virus.  if those in isolation do then develop symptoms they will be able to book a test online or by calling 119.  if they test positive they must continue to self-isolate for seven days or until symptoms have passed. if they test negative they must complete 14 days in isolation just in case the virus could not be detected yet.  members of their household will not have to stay at home unless the contacted person becomes symptomatic. then all household members must self-isolate for 14 days.  everyone who has to isolate will be entitled to statutory sick pay or if they are self-employed they will get access to a government grant.  the scheme will have the capacity to trace the contacts of 10,000 people who test positive for coronavirus per day. that capacity could be scaled up if it is deemed necessary.  royal society scientists suggested the contact tracing programme may only bring down infections by as little as five per cent.  world-leading experts from the prestigious scientific academy warned the scheme was 'not a silver bullet' and will only have a 'modest' effect on the uk's crisis.  the scientists said that testing times were still too slow and there is a good chance many britons do not adhere to self-isolation rules.  they modelled what effect contact tracing would have on britain's epidemic and found that, even if compliance is 80 per cent and the government speeds up its testing, the number of new cases will only drop by up to 15 per cent.  the report, by the data evaluation and learning for viral epidemics (delve) group, has been handed to sage scientists ahead of the rollout of the contact tracing programme.  nobel prize laureate venki ramakrishnan, chair of the delve committee, said the uk's scheme should by no means 'be considered as a silver bullet'.  the latest downing street data showed there had been 412 daily deaths from coronavirus in the uk, taking the toll to more than 37,000  some 117,013 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am taking the overall total to almost four million tests carried out  experts: uk's contact tracing scheme may only cut infections by 5% the government’s contact tracing programme will only bring down infections by a mere 5 per cent, according to royal society scientists. world-leading experts from the prestigious scientific academy warned the scheme was 'not a silver bullet' and will only have a 'modest' effect on the uk's crisis. the scientists said that testing times were still

has been handed to sage scientists ahead of the rollout of the contact tracing programme. in it, royal society academics urge ministers to focus their efforts on bringing down the average time it takes to produce a covid-19 test result. currently, swabs can take up to five days to be carried out, posted to a laboratory and analysed. if this can be slashed to three days, then the test, trace and isolate (tti) programme could see infections fall by as much as 15 per cent, delve says. nobel prize laureate venki ramakrishnan, chair of the delve committee, said the uk's scheme should by no means 'be considered as a silver bullet’.  ms harding said the success of the scheme will depend on people doing as they are told when it comes to self-isolation.  she told reporters: 'the purpose of this is to enable us to move from all of us being in national lockdown to a model where there is individual isolation if you are ill with the disease or if you have been in close contact with someone who is ill with the disease and local action where we see individual cases starting to spike.  'so it is a really important moment where all of us in the country will need to play our part in enabling us to be able to move back to a more normal life.'  despite the high stakes nature of the coronavirus outbreak and the damage a second wave would do, ms harding confirmed the government does not plan to fine people for non-compliance - at least initially.  she said: 'the secretary of state has the powers to bring in penalties but on day one that is not what we are doing.'  the fact that the system without the app is entirely reliant on human testimony has raised concerns, with people needing to remember who they have seen, where and when in order for it to work effectively.  ms harding said there was nothing abnormal about launching without the app as she said physical contact tracing 'is how contact tracing works for all infectious diseases'.  she would not be drawn on when the app will be ready as she tried to down play its significance.  'the app will be up and running soon and i am sorry, i am not going to give you a date,' she said.  'i am much more focused at the moment on getting the overall test and trace service up and running. i view the app the cherry on the cake, not the cake itself.'  concerns have been expressed that the data revealed during the contact tracing process could be passed onto the police to crackdown on non-compliance with lockdown rules.  for example, if someone has visited a friend's house during lockdown but is then flagged as a contact for a positive test and they then have to reveal their rule breaking.  but ms harding said all data shared with nhs test and trace will always be 'entirely confidential'.  the new contact tracing system does raise the prospect of some people facing more than one spell in isolation if they are flagged by more than one person who tests positive.  ms harding said repeated periods of self-isolation would likely 'trigger the investigation at a local level to say ""what is happening there""'.  she said there will be local action plans in place for 'test, tracing and containing' with councils and public health officials tasked with playing 'whack a mole' to stop potential outbreaks if the data shows a concerning spike in positive tests in a specific area.  'the best way that we can contain it will be through local public health professionals and local authority leaders going in and understanding what is really happening,' she said.  'that is what you have seen around the world where you have seen a significant outbreak, they get successfully contained, where local communities understand what is happening and work together, whether it is in rapidly testing people who don't have any symptoms to make sure that you have not got an asymptomatic group that are spreading the disease.  'whether it is infection control, deep cleaning and whether it is closing temporarily one service or another in that local community to do all that testing and cleaning. that responsibility lies with our upper tier local authorities and they will be the people marshalling the local resources.'  councils have welcomed the prospect of taking a bigger role in the fight against coronavirus but have insisted they must be given the appropriate powers to be able to act.  chairman of the local government association’s community wellbeing board, councillor ian hudspeth, said: 'covid-19 is best understood as a pattern of local outbreaks, rather than a national pandemic with a similar impact in every community, which is why councils as local leaders have a fundamental role to play in the test and trace service.  'it is good government has recognised the importance of directors of public health within councils, who need to have the necessary powers and authority to lead the response locally and tackle outbreaks early and aggressively.'  how will the coronavirus test and trace system work, will i be fined if i refuse a test and will it help to lift the coronavirus lockdown? your questions about the new system answered  millions of britons face the prospect of a fortnight in isolation even if they test positive for coronavirus under the government's new test and trace programme from this morning.  the much-delayed scheme was unveiled tonight by health secretary matt hancock, who said it was the 'civic duty' of the public to adhere to the new rules.  it will come into effect from 9am today, starting with people who have already returned a positive test.  but just what are these new rules and how will then be enforced? here we look at some of the most basic questions about the new programme which is designed to allow england - it is not yet rolling out in other nations of the uk - to return to normal.  how does it work?  health secretary matt hancock (right) and baroness harding (left) unveiled the new programme tonight  the nhs test and trace system for england will see anyone who develops symptoms told to self-isolate and get tested, with the close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease then told to quarantine for 14 days even if they test negative and are not sick.  the government and nhs has hired an enormous army of 50,000 people who will attempt to make this possible.  half, some 25,000, are contact tracers. every time someone returns a positive coronavirus test they will contact them to grill them on their movements and their known associates. the idea is to build a picture of who they have come into contact with and therefore who might be at risk of a) becoming ill themselves and b) passing it on to yet more people.  another 25,000 are testers, who will go out into the community and test these known associates.  either way, these known associates will be under orders to immediately quarantine, even if the tests they return are negative.  baroness dido harding, executive chairwoman of nhs test and trace, said compliance with the new test and trace system is 'vital' to carefully lift the remaining lockdown measures.  she said: 'step three - nhs test and trace will help you establish who you've been in close contact with and so who you might have infected and will gather their contact details.  'this could include members of your household, or someone you've been in two metres of for more than 15 minutes.'  baroness harding added: 'nhs test and trace in turn will get in touch with those contacts.  'so if you've been exposed to an infected person, they will be in contact with you. you will then be instructed by the nhs to self-isolate for 14 days, even if you don't have symptoms or you feel perfectly well. you need to follow these instructions.  'this individual and collective effort is vital if we're to keep the rate of infection down and carefully lift the lockdown.'  are there any pitfalls?  yes. this programme has been put together as quickly as possible, despite some delays.  experts immediately said the complexity of the programme meant there could be 'several points of failure' while the government's political opponents said ministers should never have largely ditched contact tracing in the first place.  without the app the tracking down of contacts will be based on the say so of people who have tested positive. that means people will need to remember exactly where they have been and who they have been close in the days leading up to their positive test. if people forget or simply remember inaccurately who they have seen it could risk the virus spreading.  baroness harding told the downing street briefing yesterday: 'we have 25,000 contact tracers ready to start work tomorrow - that is easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown.'  she said data from the isle of wight suggests people have been within two metres of fewer than five others at the moment.  what is this app people are talking about?  the system is being launched without its nhs contact tracing app centrepiece prompting concerns that without the new technology the government could struggle to tackle the spread of the disease.  experts believe the app will be crucial to the success of the programme because it can identify contacts much quicker than human contact tracers. the smartphone app uses bluetooth to register other phones it has been near for a prolonged period of time. a date has not been set for the nationwide roll out of the app but without it contact tracing will not be as swift as it would be with it.  mr hancock said it is 'not technical problems' preventing the test and trace app from being rolled out nationwide.  mr hancock said: 'no, it is not technical problems, it is that one of the things we learnt about in the isle of wight is that rolling out the system where people are asked to isolate, even if they have no symptoms, starts better when it comes in human form from the contact tracers.'  he added that 'the app is working in the isle of wight', and said that when the government has 'successfully embedded' the new nhs test and trace system, 'then that is the time to bring the app to bear'.  mr hancock continued: 'because the app is a compliment to this system, even without it this system would be successful, but it is a compliment because there are some contacts that you don't know that you might have made.'  he added: 'so the app is a compliment, it is best brought forward once this system is embedded and that is what we plan to do - it is not because of any technical glitches.'  what if people refuse to isolate? will i be fined and if so, how much?  when the scheme launches it will not come with the threat of penalties or fines for people who do not comply with the request to stay at home. however, mr johnson made clear that minister could later impose penalties if people do not play by the rules.  at tonight's press conference mr hancock said the government is 'confident' that when told to self-isolate, people will, adding: 'now of course we could also mandate that, but in the first instance we're not going to.  'this will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing.  'but, we can quickly make it mandatory if that is what it takes.  'because, if we don't collectively make this work, then the only way forward is to keep the lockdown.'  what checks are in place to stop it being open to abuse, or pretending to have the disease as a joke?  the emphasis of the entire scheme is on testing people. so people claiming to have the disease will be tested. there will be very little wriggle room. although if those who test positive fail or refuse to reveal who they have been in contact with, without the app there is very little the contact tracers can do to tell if people are telling the truth.  who is in charge of the operation where i am?  councils and public health officials will be tasked with cracking down on local spikes in infection but it was not immediately clear who will lead those efforts, how many staff members would be available to help or if local authorities will get extra funding and powers to act appropriately.  if i have to take a test, how long will it be before i know if i have the coronavirus?  the aim of the scheme is to get all test results processed and returned within 24 hours but it is unlikely to hit that goal right at the start of the rollout. that means some people could face lengthy waits to find out if they have tested positive, potentially delaying the contact tracing process and allowing the virus to spread.  baroness harding said of the test timings so far: 'yesterday, the turnaround time of our tests - we returned 84 per cent of all tests in our drive-in centres within 24 hours.  'and 95 per cent of all tests within 48 hours. i still don't think that's good enough. it's got to get better and better.'  why the big change at all, why not simply keep going the way we are?    because the current lockdown, although it has helped dramatically reduce the death rate from coronavirus, is destroying the economy.  millions of workers are surviving on furlough cash from the government and businesses have received hundreds of billions of pounds in emergency loans from chancellor rishi sunak. but it cannot go on forever.  this is all aprt of boris johnson's plan to bring the uk out of the lockdown safely.  mr hancock told the daily press briefing: 'the big question that we're all working to answer is this: until an effective treatment or vaccine comes through how can we get back to doing more of the things that make life worth living without risking safety or putting lives at risk?  'nhs test and trace is a big part - not the only part - but a big part of the answer to that question.'  mr hancock said that by tracking infected people and isolating their contacts, and by continuing social distancing, the national lockdown could be replaced with individual isolation.  could i find myself in lockdown again even if i am not tested under the new programme?  yes. 'local lockdowns' could be imposed on whole towns if there are regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases.  mr hancock said last night that the ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions will be part of the nhs test, track and trace system.  this could lead to local schools, businesses or workplaces being closed in areas with high prevalence of infection, according to the government's road map on easing lockdown restrictions.  boris johnson's crunch appearance in front of the liaison committee: pm dismisses calls for official inquiry into dominic cummings, says he wants to reduce 2m social distancing rule and admits 'not everybody' will return to school from day one  by david wilcock, whitehall correspondent for mailonline  the prime minister faced a long-awaited grilling by senior mps on the house of commons liaison committee.  the 90 minute hearing focused on coronavirus. here are the key points from mr johnson's responses.  dominic cummings row  the prime minister flatly dismissed the calls for an official inquiry into dominic cummings as he was grilled by senior mps, saying the outcry was just a 'political ding dong'.  the row over mr cummings' 260-mile trip to durham during lockdown in march and the pm's refusal to sack him is still threatening to tear the tories to pieces.  the party's poll lead has been slashed by nine points in a week - thought to be the biggest drop in a decade.  the pm said he 'totally understood public indignation' about the situation, but insisted some of the allegations about his chief aide were 'not correct' and urged people to 'move on'.  pushed on whether the cabinet secretary should carry out a formal investigation, mr johnson said there had been plenty of 'autobiography' from mr cummings and it would not be a 'good use of official time' as everyone was working 'flat out' on the coronavirus response.  the row over mr cummings' 260-mile trip to durham during lockdown in march and the pm's refusal to sack him is still threatening to tear the tories to pieces  easing social distancing  mr johnson revealed he has asked top government scientists to review the two-metre social distancing rule in the 'hope' that it can be reduced to help pubs and shops reopen.  the uk has one of the strictest contact gap rules in the world to counter coronavirus transmission, double the one metre gap recommended by the world health organisation (who).  schools and shop in the uk are due to open in the next few weeks with strict measures already being planned to keep children and shoppers two metres from each other as much as possible in both settings.  mr johnson was asked about the two metre rule by science committee chairman greg clark.  the pm replied that the science advisory group for emergencies (sage) advice was that there was a 'considerable reduction' in risk at that distance, compared to a smaller gap.  'my own hope is that as we make progress in getting the virus down ... we will be able to reduce that distance which i think will be particularly valuable on (public) transport and in the hospitality sector,' he added.  the government's women problem  mr johnson said he would have liked to have had more female representation at t"
health,"cancer, asthma and organ transplant patients were dropped from the government's coronavirus shielding list in an abrupt text message, it emerged last night.  patients with various health conditions that raise their risk of dying from covid-19 were told they had been removed from the scheme in the gov.uk text.  the message – which has caused confusion and upset - also informed them they would no longer qualify for state-provided food parcels.  those who received the text included liver transplant patients, those with brittle asthma, certain types of cancer, liver disease and people on immunosuppressant medications.  many patients were alarmed that they had been dropped from the national shielding service without being talked through the decision by their gp.  it's unclear how many patients received the text last week, but more than 2million people in england were put on the shielding list at the start of the pandemic.  cancer, asthma and organ transplant patients have been dropped from the government's coronavirus shielding list. they were informed of the decision in an abrupt text message (file)  the text, seen by the guardian, said: 'this is an update from the national shielding service.  'we understand that your gp or hospital clinician has recommended that you no longer need to follow government advice to shield.  'if you are receiving food deliveries via the national shielding service these will be stopped.  who is at high risk of covid-19 and needs to 'shield'? some groups of people are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness with coronavirus and should strictly follow shielding measures. according to nhs inform, this includes people who: have had solid organ transplants  have cancer and are receiving active chemotherapy  have lung cancer and are either receiving or previously received radical radiotherapy  have cancers of the blood or bone marrow  are receiving immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer  are receiving other targeted cancer treatments, such as protein kinase inhibitors or parp inhibitors  have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs  have severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma and severe copd  have rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections  are receiving immunosuppression therapies advertisement  'this will not affect your eligibility for a supermarket priority delivery slot or any slots you already have in place.'  leading health charities and several mps have demanded the department of health give the patients some clarity.  the british liver trust said the decision had 'caused real worry for patients' and urged those who had received a text to 'continue to shield unless you have spoken to your doctor'.  asthma uk said: 'we have heard from people with severe asthma and lung disease who have been alarmed about receiving text messages with no explanation, dropping them from shielding. some are saying their gp had also not been told. this is an utter mess.'  a spokesman for the government said: 'the government is committed to supporting the clinically extremely vulnerable and all decisions about whether someone should shield are clinically led.  'in some cases health experts have advised that a patient no longer needs to shield themselves from coronavirus. where this is the case, the person will be informed that they are not on the shielded patient list.  'those advised that they no longer need to shield may still access forms of support including the nhs volunteers network, and will retain their supermarket priority delivery slots.'  an official shielding list was assembled at the start of the pandemic, which included patients with health woes that put them at risk of coronavirus complications.  they were advised to 'stay at home at all times' and offered food packages so they did not need to venture to the shops where they could be exposed to the disease.  one in 25 people in england are on the shielding list and classified as extremely vulnerable.  care assistant louisa fenton, 24, who suffers from severe asthma, said getting the message on friday had caused her extreme distress.  she told the guardian: 'this has made me feel awful. throughout lockdown i've been living on my own and i've been relying on the food boxes.'  ms fenton said she felt like 'a guinea pig in some kind of experiment'.  it comes just weeks after more than 100,000 people were wrongly told that they were 'extremely vulnerable' to coronavirus.  letters were sent to 2.16million people advising them to 'shield' themselves by not leaving their homes and minimising all face-to-face contact - even more stringently than the measures applied to everyone else.  but around five per cent of the recipients were incorrectly included. it follows the revelation that 10,000 letters had been sent to the homes of people who had died, causing distress to families.  the initial list of qualifying patients was put together in haste in mid-march, around the same time prime minister boris johnson began addressing the nation about the impending crisis.  but the speed and complexity of the process meant errors were included. after gps were asked to validate the initial shielded patient list, around 107,000 patients were removed, the department of health and social care said."
health,"the government’s contact tracing programme will only bring down infections by a mere 5 per cent, according to royal society scientists.  world-leading experts from the prestigious scientific academy warned the scheme was 'not a silver bullet' and will only have a 'modest' effect on the uk's crisis.  the scientists said that testing times were still too slow and there was a good chance many britons do not adhere to self-isolation rules.  they modelled what effect contact tracing would have on britain' epidemic and found that, even if compliance is 80 per cent and the government speeds up its testing, the number of new cases will only drop by up to 15 per cent.  the report, by the data evaluation and learning for viral epidemics (delve) group, has been handed to sage scientists ahead of the rollout of the contact tracing programme tomorrow.  the contributions of different intervention strategies in preventing covid-19 infections: s1 to s5 are increasingly stringent measures, with s1 involving no restrictions on social interaction, only requiring households of symptomatic individuals to quarantine. s5 reflects the current situation  the impact of varying delays in testing cases and tracing close contacts (left) on the reproduction 'r' value . the impact of varying compliance with steps in the tti system (right)  the government will launch a widespread contact tracing scheme to track down people who have been in touch with infected patients starting tomorrow  it will be supported by the new nhsx app, which uses bluetooth technology to alert people when they’ve been close to a covid-19 patient  in it, royal society academics urge ministers to focus their efforts on bringing down the average time it takes to produce a covid-19 test result.  currently, swabs can take up to five days to be carried out, posted to a laboratory and analysed.  if this can be slashed to three days, then the test, trace and isolate (tti) programme could see infections fall by as much as 15 per cent, delve says.  nobel prize laureate venki ramakrishnan, chair of the delve committee, said the uk's scheme should by no means 'be considered as a silver bullet’.  the professor of structural biology said tti has the potential to ‘play an important part in bringing this pandemic under control’ but social distancing and stringent hand-washing protocol would be just as important.  how will contact tracers work alongside the nhs app? the bulk of contact tracing work will be contracted out to at least two companies, including serco, who are being asked to provide 15,000 call centre staff. they will designated specific areas of the country and will receive alerts when nhsx app users come into contact with suspected patients. it is their job to phone these people and advise they self isolate and be vigilant about changes in their health and about social distancing. if they become ill, they will be tested. if a contact becomes infected, the same process begins for them and their social network. the idea is to keep track of how the virus moves through social circles and to try to stay a step ahead of it and prevent wider spread. ministers have also promised an additional 3,000 former doctors and nurses who have been recruited from the pool of retired nhs staff who volunteered to return to help during the pandemic. they will be able to provide medical advice to confirmed and suspected patients. the tracers will make a list of people considered to have been put at risk by the patient, and those people will be notified that they might have the coronavirus. the nhsx app would need more than 70 per cent of the uk population to download and use it for it to be effective. but ministers say physical contact tracing will make up for the shortcomings of the app if update is below 70 per cent. advertisement  starting tomorrow, everyone who displays coronavirus symptoms will be asked to report themselves to ‘test and trace’ officials either online or through a new helpline.  their job will be to find, test and isolate these people and contact anyone who they have had close interactions with.  family members, flatmates, partners and close contacts will be told to go into isolation for a fortnight even if they have no symptoms.  anyone told to self quarantine will be entitled to statutory sick pay, or if they are self-employed they will have access to government grants.  the tti programme is seen as critical for pulling the country out of lockdown. but delve has warned that it will only work if the overwhelming majority of britons comply.  professor anne johnson, an epidemiologist at university college london and a member of the delve committee, said: ‘one of the keys to success of any potential tti programme will be ensuring that it is carried out in an integrated way – joining up public health england, nhsx, primary and community care and the various other strands required to deliver a truly national effort.  ‘fast testing also allows those who are not infected, and their families, to carry on with their lives. there are many potential pitfalls for such a system and it is important that all of those are carefully considered in introducing such a complex undertaking.’  the tti programme will be supported by the new nhsx app, which uses bluetooth technology to alert people when they’ve been close to a covid-19 patient.  after some technical problems and concerns about data privacy, officials say the app is now on course for a national rollout within weeks, having passed a trial on the isle of wight.  other critical unanswered questions about tti - such as how self-isolation will be enforced - will be announced at downing street's press conference tonight.  the royal society set up the delve multi-disciplinary group - made up of 14 leading experts from the country's top universities - to come up with the exit strategy.  it is tasked with giving input to the government through sage, its scientific advisory group for emergencies.  a department of health spokesperson said: 'this modelling makes incorrect assumptions on how long it takes for test results to be received - 84 per cent of tests conducted at our testing sites are returned in under 24 hours. as a result their findings are not accurate.  'more than 2 million people have been tested and the vast majority report no issues with the process.  'the test and trace service, which includes dedicated contact tracing staff, public health experts and digital technology, will swiftly get in touch with anyone considered to be at heightened risk of having been exposed to the virus and advise them on the steps they need to take to stop the spread of coronavirus and protect their families, friends, neighbours and work colleagues.  'everyone needs to play their part in this effort and follow the advice.'  despite calls from delve to speed up covid-19 testing, british health officials have told companies offering covid-19 antibody tests to stop processing blood samples from patients in the uk.  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) has confirmed that they have told firms to stop analysing the blood samples that people in the uk submit for testing  cdc warns antibody tests are wrong up to half the time antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time, according to updated information from the centers for disease control. the cdc now warns antibody testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions, as even with high test specificity, 'less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies'. it urges caution with the test results as many false positives could lead people to believe they have an immunity to coronavirus and act accordingly. health care providers may need to test patients at least twice to give a more accurate reading, the new guidance posted to the cdc website adds. antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it. there is currently a high level of inaccuracy in the testing, however, caused by how uncommon the virus is within the population. if the infection has affected only a small number of people tested, it will have a magnified margin of error, the cdc explains. it means that even a test with more than 90 per cent accuracy can still miss half the cases if only five percent of the population has been infected.  private tests to see whether people have already had the disease and recovered are now available from various online pharmacies from around £69.  superdrug became the first high street retailer to offer the service and numerous websites offer similar tests, including lloyds pharmacy.  now the government, which has previously been accused of trying to take control of coronavirus testing among the public, has slammed the brakes on private tests.  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) has confirmed it has told firms to stop analysing the blood samples people submit for testing.  at least two labs that process antibody tests using finger-prick samples are known to be affected by the move.  the news comes after public health england's testing tsar, professor john newton, last week urged people not to pay for private tests and to wait for official ones.  and it comes after us health body the centers for disease control warned antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time.  the government has bought 10million tests from pharmaceutical giant roche and will start using them on nhs and care staff from this week.  the mhra and department of health officials are expected to meet tomorrow to discuss the issue.  the way antibody tests work is that someone takes their own blood sample, or a medical professional takes it for them, and that is posted off to a lab.  there, qualified technicians analyse the blood to look for antibodies for the coronavirus, which are immune system substances created when someone is infected with the virus.  people then receive a result in which the presence of antibodies - a positive result - indicates they have already had the virus, or the absence that they have not.  the lab analysis stage is now being blocked by the mhra, mailonline understands.  it comes as boris johnson prepares to announce two households will allowed to meet up from next week.  ministers are said to have parked proposals for people to be able to mix in social 'bubbles' after expert modelling suggested it could lead to a spike in coronavirus.  they are instead considering a plan which would allow people to see more of their loved ones in person but with social distancing still in place, meaning hugs and handshakes would remain banned.  however, the scheme, which could be rolled out from june 1 at the start of boris johnson's second phase of easing, could force households to nominate the friends or family they want to be allowed to see.  concerns have also been voiced in cabinet that the rules should not be seen as a 'barbecue clause', allowing for meet-ups in gardens.  current lockdown rules dictate that you can meet up with one other person from outside your household outdoors as long as you remain two metres apart.  the new plan, first reported by the times, would allow two households to link up although it is unclear whether everyone in each household would be allowed to attend. this would potentially allow people to see their parents at the same time, for example, something which the existing restrictions prohibit.  it could see people given the green light to invite their partnered household to visit them in a private garden."
health,"most people who recover from the novel coronavirus generate at least some antibodies capable of neutralizing sars-cov-2, the first round of results from a new study suggest.  while many antibodies grab hold of the virus, only a few counteract the pathogen and prevent it from entering our cells.  researchers from rockefeller university in new york city looked at 149 recovered patients and determined that the majority had a weak antibody response.  however, they found that every patient's immune system seemed to be capable of generating the types of antibodies that neutralize the virus, just not particularly enough of them.  researchers looked at 149 recovered coronavirus patients who donated plasma, which is supposed to contain virus-fighting antibodies. pictured: town of vail mayor dave chapin gets hooked up to donate plasma, april 28  about 79% had low levels of antibodies in their blood, but 1% of 'elite donors' had very high levels meaning only some produce enough antibodies to neutralize the virus. pictured: emts transport a patient from a nursing home to an emergency room bed at st joseph's hospital in yonkers, ny, april 20  'this suggests just about everybody can do this, which is very good news for vaccines,' dr michel c nussenzweig, head of the laboratory of molecular immunology at rockefeller, said in a statement.  'it means if you were able to create a vaccine that elicits these particular antibodies, then the vaccine is likely to be effective and work for a lot of people.'  for the study, published on pre-peer review site biorxiv.org, the team looked at 149 people who donated plasma at the rockefeller hospital in new york city over the course of five weeks.  convalescent plasma is the liquid portion of blood is taken from a recovered coronavirus patient, which contains antibodies and immune b-cells.  participants had symptoms of the virus for about 12 days while infected, and their first symptoms occurred about 39 days before they donated plasma.  researchers then mixed the plasma with a pseudo coronavirus and measured if or how well the virus would infect human cells in a petri dish.  most samples did not do very well at neutralizing the virus.  in fact, the neutralizing effect was undetectable in 33 percent of donors. the investigators say this may be because their immune systems cleared the infection before antibodies could be produced.  they found that the effect was very high among one percent of patients, so-called 'elite donors.'  the team identified 40 antibodies that neutralized the virus, and focused on three that did so even at low levels.  these antibodies bound to at least three sites on the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus that it uses to enter our cells.  researchers now plan to clone these antibodies in hopes it will help patients with severe or life-threatening cases of the virus.  'we now know what an effective antibody looks like and we have found similar ones in more than one person,' robbiani said.  'this is important information for people who are designing and testing vaccines. if they see their vaccine can elicit these antibodies, they know they are on the right track.'  in the the us, there are more than 1.6 million confirmed of the virus and more than 99,000 deaths."
health,"the former chief executive of talktalk, who was at the helm of the company when it was hit by an £80 million cyber attack in 2015, will lead the uk's test and trace scheme to tackle the coronavirus, set to launch tomorrow.  baroness dido harding of winscombe, 53, was raised on a somerset pig farm and is the granddaughter of field marshall lord harding, the commander of the desert rats who became the most senior soldier in the british army.  a former jockey, she studied policy, politics and economics at oxford university, alongside david cameron, and is the wife of john penrose, the conservative mp for weston-super-mare.  upon graduating, she held a slew of roles at thomas cook, woolworths, tesco and sainsbury's.  baroness harding was appointed ceo of talktalk in 2010, serving in the role for seven years, during which the company was the victim of a cyber attack that saw the personal and banking details of 157,000 customers accessed by hackers.  she was subjected to repeated blackmail attempts after the hack, with demands for bitcoins in exchange for stolen data, which included customers' names, email addresses, mobile numbers, home addresses and dates of birth.  former talktalk ceo baroness dido harding will lead the uk's test and trace scheme to tackle the coronavirus, set to launch tomorrow  baroness harding is a former jockey, though she quit racing after hitting 40 and promising her husband she'd stop  in the aftermath, talktalk was fined a record £400,000 for security failings which allowed the data to be accessed 'with ease' in one of the biggest data breaches in history.  talktalk is thought to have lost £60million from the fallout with an estimated 100,000 angry customers leaving, mainly to bt, while 2015 profits halved to £14million and shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value.  baroness harding faced repeated calls to step down over the breach, but stayed on until 2017, when she resigned to focus on her 'public service activities'.  later that year, she was appointed chair of nhs improvement, responsible for overseeing all nhs hospitals.  a powerful figure, she refuses to believe her gender has ever held her back, nor will she endorse female quotas on company boards, which she sees as political meddling.  she also thinks that workers have too much maternity leave, despite admitting being the boss has allowed her to successfully juggle her own career with spending time with the two daughters she has with her husband.  she studied policy, politics and economics at oxford university, alongside david cameron, and is married to john penrose, conservative mp for weston-super-mare  she said in a 2015 interview: ' i have an enormously privileged position.  'i make a lot of money – a matter of public record – i have a huge amount of help, and i’m more in control of the day and what i do than someone working shifts on the checkout, or running the produce department in a supermarket.'  baroness harding has also packed in a career as a jockey, which saw her appear at cheltenham, ascot and even the towering grand national jumps at aintree.  one particularly nasty crash over the sticks at larkhill left her strapped to a spinal board - though she still managed to catch a flight to a conference in thailand the next day.  as talktalk ceo, she was presented with the daily mail wooden spoon award for 'worst customer service'  but, aged 24, she made a rash promise to her husband – she would give it all up at 40.  when the date came penrose, who had not forgotten, made it clear breaching the bargain was a deal-breaker for the marriage.  harding obliged, though does still race without jumps.  'i miss the racing hugely,' she previously admitted. 'if you told me i could go off and do it tomorrow afternoon i would. for me that’s always been my way of shutting everything off and relaxing.'  now, she is the leader of the government's coronavirus tracing programme.  the nhs test and trace system for england will see anyone who develops symptoms told to self-isolate and get tested, with the close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease then told to quarantine for 14 days even if they test negative and are not sick.  the system is being launched without its nhs contact tracing app centrepiece prompting concerns that without the new technology the government could struggle to tackle the spread of the disease.  experts immediately said the complexity of the programme meant there could be 'several points of failure' while the government's political opponents said ministers should never have largely ditched contact tracing in the first place.  mr hancock said that adhering to self-isolation would be 'voluntary at first' but that he could 'quickly make it mandatory if that is what it takes'.  he told the daily downing street press conference: 'if you are contacted by nhs test and trace instructing you to isolate, you must. it is your civic duty, so you avoid unknowingly spreading the virus and you help to break the chain of transmission.'  the launch of the programme was announced by boris johnson during an appearance in front of the liaison committee this afternoon as he admitted the uk's testing capability was underpowered at the start of the outbreak because the 'brutal reality' was britain did not 'learn the lessons' of previous pandemics."
health,"men with longer ring fingers face a lower risk of dying from covid-19 and are more likely to suffer mild symptoms, researchers claim.  academics found coronavirus death rates in countries where men have shorter ring fingers were up to a third higher.  ring finger length is determined by how much testosterone a foetus is exposed to when growing in the womb, the experts said.  the more testosterone a male is exposed to in the womb, the longer their ring finger will be, it is believed.  testosterone is thought to be protective against severe covid-19 by increasing the number of ace-2 receptors in the body.  scientists believe the coronavirus, officially called sars-cov-2, enters the body and causes infection through these receptors.  but studies also suggest that high levels of ace-2 receptors can protect against lung damage, which the coronavirus can cause.  the new study, carried out by swansea university, found men with low testosterone levels are twice as likely to die of covid-19 than men with higher levels.  how to see if you have a long ring finger: measure the index finger and the ring finger to the closest millimetre. the first measurement is divided by the second measurement to get the digit ratio. the smaller the digit ratio, the longer the ring finger is. the country with the smallest average male right hand digit ratio was malaysia, with 0.976. the higher the digit ratio, the shorter the ring finger is. bulgaria has the highest male right hand digit ratio, with 0.99  academics found coronavirus death rates in countries where men have shorter ring fingers were higher. the case fatality rate was an average of 4.9 (per 100,000) in the top 10 countries with the shortest finger length, including in bulgaria, argentina and turkey. it was an average of 2.7 in the top 10 countries with the longest finger length, including malaysia, mexico and russia  researchers found that in countries where the right hand digit ratio was smaller, including malaysia, russia and mexico, the case fatality rate was lower (left side)  why are males more at risk of covid-19? several studies have reported a higher fatality rate in men compared with women. scientists hypothesise that men are less likely to wash their hands often, may not seek medical help, have a genetically disadvantaged immune system compared to women, or have more underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable. adults the disparity between adult men and women has largely been put down to behaviours, including drinking alcohol, smoking, and eating unhealthily. dr james gill, a locum gp and honorary clinical lecturer, warwick medical school, said theories lie on the assumption that simply men don’t look after their bodies as well, with higher levels of smoking, alcohol use, obesity and other deleterious health behaviours. these would put men at a higher risk of health conditions - which has been confirmed to be detrimental to covid-19 outcomes. the sex differential in smoking is especially marked in some countries such as china, where 50 per cent of men smoke compared to five per cent in women. however, dr gill said: 'whilst smoking is a plausible factor, globally, across various different cultures, where smoking rates do differ, we are still seeing the sustained difference in mortality between men and women. 'whilst we don’t have a definitive answer on why there is a difference between how men and women respond a covid19 infection at the immunological level - yet - currently it is a fair assumption that there will be a significant interplay between the biology and the environmental facts.' children the slight increase in boys being infected with coronavirus compared to girls cannot be the result of behaviours such as smoking. philip goulder fmedsci, professor of immunology in the department of paediatrics, university of oxford, explained how males and females have genetically different immune responses, which would be present from birth. he said: 'it is becoming increasingly recognised that there are substantial differences in the immune system between males and females and that these have significant impact on outcome from a wide range of infectious diseases. 'several factors contribute to this, but these include the fact that females have two x chromosomes compared to one in males, and a number of critical immune genes are located on the x chromosome. 'in particular, the protein by which viruses such as coronavirus are sensed is encoded on the x chromosome. as a result, this protein is expressed at twice the dose on many immune cells in females compared to males, and the immune response to coronavirus is therefore amplified in females.' this effect can be seen in how the body responds to vaccines. the immune response throughout life to vaccines and infections is typically more aggressive and more effective in females compared to males, professor goulder said. advertisement  mounting evidence has shown men are more likely to die from the coronavirus than women - but scientists have been unable to determine exactly why this is.  in england and wales, the covid-19 death rate for men is 97.5 per 100,000 people compared to 46.5 for females, according to the office for national statistics.  scientists believe men are less likely to wash their hands, may not seek medical help, and have more underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable.  but testosterone could be one of the key reasons why so many men are dying from coronavirus, doctors believe.  swansea university experts added to the theory that men who have low testosterone levels are at more at risk of covid-19 than other men.  they looked at data of 200,000 people in 41 countries where the researchers had already measured the finger lengths of volunteers.  some researchers believe finger lengths reflect a foetus's exposure to testosterone and other hormones that guide development in the womb.  the index finger and the ring finger was measured to the closest millimetre. the first measurement is divided by the second measurement to get the 2d:4d ratio.  the smaller the digit ratio, the longer the ring finger is. the country with the smallest average male right hand digit ratio was malaysia, with 0.976.  the higher the digit ratio, the shorter the ring finger is. bulgaria has the highest male right hand digit ratio, with 0.99.  researchers found that in countries where the male digit ratio was smaller, including malaysia, russia and mexico, the case fatality rate of covid-19 was lower.  and in countries where the male digit ratio was higher, including the uk, bulgaria and spain, the case fatality rate was higher.  case fatality rate is how many people who die from covid-19 after being diagnosed.  in the uk, official figures show the virus has a case-fatality ratio of around 11 per cent.  it is different to the mortality rate, which takes into consideration everyone who has ever been infected, including those with none or mild symptoms.  case fatality rate at this stage of the pandemic is not considered entirely accurate because it relies on testing strategies identifying all cases, and this varies from country to country.  the case fatality rate for each nation in the study included women. however, the link between finger length and deaths was still there when women were removed from the statistics.  the findings were more significant when looking at the right hands of men than their left hands.  women's finger length didn't seem to affect death rates, according to the study, published in the journal early human development.    when looking specifically at the left hand, the top 10 countries with the longest male ring finger had an average case fatality rate of 3.1 per 100,000 people, compared to the 10 countries with the shortest ring finger, with an average fatality rate of 5.  how can you measure your 2d:4d ratio? a relatively long ring finger is a sign of exposure to higher levels of testosterone in the womb, while a relatively long index finger points to greater amounts of oestrogen. one theory is that for a short time in foetal development, there are testosterone receptors on the fingers and that the ring finger may have more of these receptors and grow faster when exposed to it. so, how do you measure your 2d:4d ratio? for readers, there are several ways to figure out their 2d:4d ratio. the new research uses an electronic caliper. respondents were asked to place their hands on a flat surface, palms facing upwards, and straighten out their fingers. a researcher then measured the length of the index and ring fingers on both hands. this measurement should be taken from the center of the fold between the finger and palm up to the very tip of the finger. that way the upper lip of the caliper does not press against the finger.  and for the right hand, the top 10 countries with the longest ring finger had an average case fatality rate of 2.7, compared to the 10 countries with the shortest ring finger, with an average fatality rate of 4.9.  lead researcher professor john manning, said this may give australia, new zealand, austria and east asian nations, where male ring fingers are longer, 'a biological advantage', the sun reports.  he added: 'our findings may be men with long ring fingers will experience mild symptoms and could return to work.'  the researchers said that finger length is an indicator of how much testosterone a foetus was exposed to while growing.  professing manning said: 'the theory is that someone with high prenatal testosterone — and a long ring finger — has greater levels of ace2.  'these concentrations are large enough to oppose the virus.'  cell receptors called ace-2, which coat the surfaces of cells, are what the coronavirus attaches to in order to infect our healthy cells.  it’s thought that the more of these receptors you have, the more entry points there are for the virus.  however, ace-2 receptors are thought to limit disease progression once the coronavirus is in the body.  the virus is known to cause lung damage by depleting the numbers of ace-2 receptors once inside the body.  what is an ace-2 receptor and what does it have to do with covid-19? ace-2 receptors are structures found on the surface of cells in the lungs and airways which work with an enyzme called ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme) to regulate blood pressure. its exact function in the lungs is not well understood but studies suggest it is protective against lung damage and low levels of it can worsen the impact of viral infections. scientists say that the coronavirus which causes covid-19 enters the body through the ace-2 receptor, which the shape of it allows it to latch on to. this means that someone with more ace-2 receptors may be more susceptible to a large viral load - first infectious dose of a virus - entering their bloodstream. ace-2 receptors have a shape which matches the outside of the coronavirus, effectively providing it with a doorway into the bloodstream, scientists say people who have higher than usual numbers of ace-2 receptors may include those with diabetes or high blood pressure because they have genetic defects which make them produce more. emerging evidence shows that smokers may also produce more. high levels of ace-2 receptors may also be protective, however. they are thought to be able to protect the lungs during infection and a study on mice in 2008 found that mice which had ace-2 blocked in their bodies suffered more damage when they were infected with sars, which is almost identical to covid-19. smoking has in the past been repeatedly linked to lower than normal levels of ace-2 receptors, potentially increasing the risk of lung damage from covid-19.  therefore, it seems that people who express high levels of ace-2 may in fact be protected against disease severity.  professor manning wrote in his paper: 'the ace-2 gene is more strongly expressed in females compared to males.  'these associations suggest a negative correlation between ace-2 expression and covid-19 fatality.  'the down-regulation of ace-2 may therefore be associated with poor prognosis from covid-19.  'research suggests that testosterone in men (and estrogen in women) up-regulates ace-2.'  the paper concludes: 'a strong positive association between male 2d:4d (digit ratio) and mortality may provide a biomarker for male covid-19 susceptibility and identify those for whom it would be advisable to exercise social distancing.'  a recent study found men with low testosterone levels that contract covid-19 are at far greater risk of dying from the virus, a study has found.  samples from the 45 covid-19 patients in a german hospital were tested for 12 hormones, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.  professor gülsah gabriel from the leibniz institute for experimental virology in hamburg, who was involved in the research, told mailonline: 'the majority of male covid-19 patients had low testosterone levels.  'of those male covid-19 patients who died, the majority also had low testosterone levels.  'thus, low testosterone levels in men seem to be a risk factor for severe and even fatal disease outcome in men upon infection with so-called “cytokine inducing” respiratory viruses.'  testosterone is known to help regulate the body's immune response but when a man has low levels of testosterone, the immune system is not kept in check and can go haywire following infection.  this leads to a so-called cytokine storm which happens when the immune system goes out of control as it tries to kill the pathogen.  a cytokine storm eventually begins damaging the body itself and, if left unchecked, can be fatal.  of the male covid-19 patients sent to icu at the german hospital, more than two thirds (68.6 per cent) recorded low levels of testosterone.  in contrast, the majority of female patients (60 per cent) had elevated testosterone levels.  while low levels of testosterone can not control the immune response in men, the study found that in female covid-19 patients, higher testosterone levels were linked to a more significant inflammatory response."
health,"monitoring sewage for high concentrations of coronavirus genetic material might help officials predict new outbreaks up to seven days early, new research suggests.  scientists have recently confirmed that while spit and mucus from coughs and sneezes are the main ways that coronavirus is transmitted, humans also 'shed' the virus in feces.  yale university scientists have been carefully studying a waste treatment facility in new haven, connecticut for signs of the virus for about a month-and-a-half.  the found spikes in levels of genetic material in sewage preceded similar increases in positive coronavirus tests in the area as well as upticks in hospitalizations.  as the us begins to reopen, poop monitoring programs might help cities prepare for resurgences of the virus that many public health experts worry are all but inevitable as people emerge from isolation and come into contact with one another.  levels of coronavirus genes in sewage (pictured) peaked three days before hospitalizations and a week before cases of the disease did in new haven, connecticut, suggesting that sewage may help predict emerging outbreaks (file)  between march 19 and may 20, the yale researchers tested samples of sludge from a treatment facility in new haven that processes wastewater for about 200,000 residents of the city.  simultaneously, they tracked how hospital admissions and positive tests in the city went up or down each day.  they're the latest in a series of research groups in the us and abroad to look to sewage as a metric for coronavirus outbreaks.  efforts to track case, hospitalization and death increases and declines in cities and states are crucial, especially as localities begin to reopen.  the continued spread of coronavirus is all but certain, but if there are marked surges in these counts, they will serve as a warning sign that a larger outbreak may be in progress, triggering lockdowns to resume so that hospitals don't get overwhelmed.  but the us has struggled to keep up with case increases especially, due to testing delays and flawed tests.  that may mean that it's too late to stop community transmission by the time a notable increase in positive covid-19 test results.  so experts are eager to find alternative, early signals of rising case loads in communities.  the viral load of sewage (red) peaked a week earlier than did the number of new daily coronavirus infections in new haven (black), the study found  similarly, the height of coronavirus concentration in sampled sludge came three days sooner than the height of hospital admissions for covid-19 in the connecticut city  poop may hold the solution to the problem.  when someone is infected with a virus the 'shed' it, meaning that traces of the virus's genetic material (rna, in the case of coronavirus) are present in cells that leave their bodies in various ways.  people with coronavirus shed it in saliva and mucus that enter the environment via coughs and sneezes and also shed it in their feces.  importantly, fecal viral shedding of coronavirus begins before people show symptoms.  the researchers found that every single sample of sludge they took contained coronavirus rna.  in new haven, the number of people hospitalized for coronavirus peaked on april 12.  but the levels of of the virus detected in sewage peaked on april 9 - three days sooner.  and the peak number of cases in the city could be predicted even earlier with sewage.  levels in sludge hit their height on april 9, where as cases peaked on april 16.  what's more, declines in cases and hospitalizations were similarly preceded by declining coronavirus concentrations in sewage, according to a copy of the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, published on medrxiv.org.  'our study could have substantial policy implications,' the researchers wrote.  'jurisdictions can use primary sludge sars-cov-2 concentrations to preempt community outbreak dynamics or provide an additional basis for easing restrictions, especially when there are limitations in clinical testing.  'raw wastewater and sludge-based surveillance is particularly useful for low and middle-income countries where clinical testing capacity is limited.'"
health,"convalescent plasma infusions help improve the conditions of patients hospitalized with the novel coronavirus, a new study suggests.  researchers found the disease worsened in less than one-fifth of people who received blood plasma from a recovered coronavirus patient.  comparatively, nearly one-quarter of patients who didn't receive plasma saw their health rapidly decline.  the team, from mount sinai hospital in new york city, found that patients who received plasma needed less oxygen support, were less likely die and more likely to be discharged from the hospital.  health experts say plasma is a potentially game-changing treatment but, with few donations, doctors have to decide which patients receive it and which do not.  plasma therapy is when the liquid portion of blood is taken from a recovered coronavirus patient and transferred into a sick patient in hopes they will develop the antibodies needed to fight off the infection. pictured: melissa cruz donates covid-19 convalescent plasma at bloodworks northwest in seattle, washington, april 17  in a new study, about 18% of 39 coronavirus patients who received plasma infusions saw their conditions worsen (left) compared to 24% of the group who didn't receive plasma (right)  convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental treatment in which plasma from a recovered coronavirus patient is used on an infected patient in critical condition.  the hope is that the antibodies and immunity in the blood of a healthy person will be transferred to a sick person.  from this, the infected person will then develop the antibodies needed to fight off the coronavirus.  the treatment was first used during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918, a situation not far removed from the coronavirus pandemic.  for the study, published on the pre-peer-reviewed server medrxiv.org, the team compared 39 coronavirus patients who received plasma transfusions to 156 patients who did not.  all of the patients had severe to life-threatening cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and were hospitalized between march 24 and april 8 of this year.  results showed the conditions worsened among 18 percent of plasma patients compared to 24 percent of those who didn't receive it.  on days one and seven, the plasma group had fewer patients with worse 'oxygenation status,' but the control group didn't have any statistical difference.  after 16 days, only 13 percent of plasma patients died in comparison with 24 percent of the control group.  additionally, about 72 percent of plasma recipients were discharged from the hospital compared to 67 percent of control patients.  nearly 13% of plasma patients died and 72% were discharged compared to 24% of control patients who died and 67% who were discharged. pictured: medical workers walk outside a special coronavirus area at maimonides medical center in brooklyn, new york, may 26  'convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with covid-19,' the authors wrote.  they note that a randomized, controlled trial is needed to back up the study's findings.  the us food and drug administration (fda) approved the use of convalescent plasma for treatment last month.  'prior experience with respiratory viruses and limited data that have emerged from china suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by covid-19,' the agency said in a statement on april 16.  however, the fda added it must be given on case-by-case basis, and patients who receive it must be experiencing conditions such as respiratory failure or multiple organ failure.  people can donate plasma more than once, but have to wait several weeks after donating."
health,"forty per cent of staff at a hospital in weston-super-mare closed to new admissions because of a spike in covid-19 patients have symptoms of the infection, it has been claimed.  a memo leaked to a local newspaper revealed weston general hospital, which has around 2,000 staff, warned of a high rate of coronavirus cases among medics.  the trust that runs the hospital has yet to deny the claims, and admitted last night there is an 'emerging picture' of staff with no symptoms testing positive for covid-19.  these silent carriers of the virus can unknowingly spread the virus to other people, with scientists previously finding up to half of cases are caused by asymptomatic spread.  the hospital suddenly stopped accepting new admissions on monday, including to a&e, due to a 'high number of covid-19 patients'.  but causes of the outbreak have been a mystery, with locals blaming tourists crowding the beaches over the past two weeks.  weston general hospital, in weston-super-mare, that shut to new patients has an 'emerging picture' of staff with no symptoms testing positive for covid-19  weston general hospital initially said it was closing its doors on monday morning due to a flare in covid-19 patients. bosses said there was a 'high number of covid-19 patients'.  somerset live claims it saw a message reportedly sent to nhs staff in the south west region on sunday, may 24.  the message, shared by an unnamed nhs worker, said testing of staff at weston general, including workers without any symptoms, has revealed '40 per cent as covid-19 positive'.  and the newspaper claimed the leaked memo, which the nhs trust has yet to deny is false, said more than 64 patients have tested positive in the hospital, up from 30 patients at the beginning of last week.  an update from university hospitals bristol and weston nhs foundation trust, which runs the hospital, revealed more on tuesday evening.  trust medical director dr william oldfield said they are in the process of testing all staff in clinical areas at the hospital who may have had some patient contact.  'there is an emerging picture of asymptomatic staff testing positive for the virus,' he said.  how many nhs workers have covid-19? of all people who are infected with the coronavirus, 80 per cent have only mild symptoms or none at all, according to data published by the world health organisation. there have been various studies which have sampled groups of people to figure out how many are asymptomatic. a recent study suggested thousands of nhs staff could be unknowingly infected with coronavirus without symptoms. university of cambridge academics took swabs of 1,200 workers at addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge over three weeks in april. some 75 per cent of were women. the researchers used the gold stand of testing - called pcr - which looks for genetic material of the virus on swab samples taken from the nose or mouth. workers were asked about any symptoms of covid-19 and were divided into two groups. of those who had signs of the disease (169), 15 per cent tested positive. but of the 1,032 staff members reporting fit for work because they did not have symptoms, three per cent tested positive for the infection. around 20 per cent of those who received a shock diagnosis reported no symptoms of the virus, which means they could have unknowingly spread the disease to patients. some 40 per cent had very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further 40 per cent reported symptoms that ended a week before. they potentially transmitted the virus to co-workers, family members and patients, during the month of april. if the results are applied to the 500,000 nhs frontline workers across britain, the data suggests 15,000 may have tested positive for the killer infection last month. but it is not known whether cambridge is a particularly hard-hit region or if it has escaped lightly, meaning the rate of infection could be different elsewhere. researchers have now called for nhs workers to be tested every day for covid-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms. advertisement  dr oldfield said members of staff who have tested positive have self-isolated in line with national guidance.  he said there are 'appropriate levels' of personal protective equipment (ppe) available and added that 'there have been significant efforts to minimise unnecessary staff movements across the hospital'.  people who are infected with covid-19 but show no symptoms could make up a significant proportion of covid cases, research suggests.  one study of staff at addenbrooke's hospital swabbed 1,000 nhs workers who were deemed fit to work, and found three per cent had covid-19.  if applied to the 500,000 nhs frontline workers across britain, the data suggests 15,000 may have tested positive for the killer infection in april, when the study was conducted.  experts have called for nhs workers to be screened regularly in order to identify anyone carrying the virus without knowing.  professor charles swanton, who works at the francis crick institute, underlined the importance of screening healthcare workers for covid-19 in an article published in the lancet on april 15.  he said: 'increased testing capacity will enable all staff who are self-isolating unnecessarily to bolster a depleted workforce. asymptomatic health care workers (hcws) are an underappreciated potential source of infection and worthy of testing.'  dr oldfield said in the statement yesterday: 'testing for symptomatic staff and household contacts has been offered across the trust since the beginning of april.'  he confirmed there were 'currently a high number of patients with coronavirus in the hospital', who were being 'appropriately segregated', but did not clarify if this was the sole reason the hospital had shut.  local mp, john penrose, said the hospital was having a 'deep clean' after speaking to health chiefs.  he told mailonline: 'as i hope everyone would expect, i've been meeting local health chiefs to get to the bottom of this.  'they say the hospital isn't full and there are enough spare beds, but they're worried about cross-infecting non-covid patients, so they want to stop new arrivals until they've deep-cleaned it and checked all the staff too.  'they're running tests which they hope will reveal the truth of it, so we should know more once the results come in.'  weston-super-mare is in somerset, the south west. the region has been the least affected by the coronavirus so far  angry residents say 'it's not rocket science' - there has been an outbreak in weston-super-mare because crowds are unable to stay socially distanced at the beach. pictured: the promenade on may 25  weston-super-mare's covid-19 outbreak remains shrouded in mystery - but scientists and residents say it could be due to tourists flocking to the beach (pictured yesterday)  mr penrose said there was 'no evidence to show if the outbreak is connected to visitors on the seafront', after day-trippers were blamed for a surge in cases.  worker at hospital died of covid-19 in april an employee at weston general hospital, which has been closed to new patients due to a 'high number of covid-19 patients', passed away on april 23. amarante dias died after testing positive for covid-19. it is not clear what his job role is or when he had been working at the hospital. dr william oldfield, medical director at the university hospitals bristol and weston nhs trust, said: 'we are deeply saddened at losing amarante dias who was such a valued and much-loved colleague. 'on behalf of everyone at university hospitals bristol and weston nhs foundation trust, including our patients and the communities we serve, i would like to offer my sincerest condolences to his family. 'amarante will be greatly missed and we are ensuring that staff have access to support to help them at this difficult time. 'we will not be commenting further and ask that everybody respects the privacy of the family at their request.' the weston super mare association of malayalees posted a tribute on social media: 'our deepest sympathy and prayers to you and your family, (amarante dias) will deeply be missed.'  people who live in weston-super-mare said it was clear tourists who flocked to beaches after the lockdown was loosened were contributing to spread of the virus.  the beaches in somerset and elsewhere have been packed with tourists since prime minister boris johnson allowed people in england to travel as far as they like to enjoy unlimited exercise and sunbathing.  the south west region has so far experienced the fewest cases and deaths from covid-19 in england.  university hospitals bristol and weston trust (uhbw), which has confirmed 118 coronavirus deaths across its two hospitals.  but it is unclear how many of those happened at weston general and its other hospital, bristol royal infirmary (bri).  weston general said it was taking some patients on compassionate grounds, including those with disabilities or to the maternity ward.  yesterday it urged patients with appointments to not travel to the hospital, and has also set out rules on when people can visit amid the 'temporary' shutdown.  dr oldfield added that people needing care are currently being provided for in other settings as they work to reopen their a&e department 'as soon as possible'.  he said: 'well-established arrangements are in place for any emergency referrals to weston to go to other healthcare providers, new patients continue to have access to treatment and care in other appropriate healthcare settings in the area should they need it, and we are contacting patients who have planned appointments to discuss alternative arrangements.  'we are continuing to take the necessary steps with the aim of reopening the a&e department and accepting new patients as soon as possible.'  mailonline has asked the trust to comment.  locals tonight told how weston-super-mare beach was crowded with birmingham day trippers just days before the local hospital was forced to close its doors to new patients because of a covid-19 outbreak.  weston-super-mare beach was said to be crowded with vistors from birmingham during the day  locals spotted many people with birmingham accents not keeping to social distancing rules  paul roles, from bath in somerset, said the town and beach were full of visitors from the midlands city, more than a hundred miles north, last thursday.  he said: ‘i was walking on the promenade and there were a lot of people about and most of them had a birmingham or west midlands accent.  ‘birmingham is about a two-hour drive up the m5 and has been hit pretty hard by the coronavirus. it was one of the worst infected places in the uk.  ‘i found out that people from the city have apparently been coming down in big numbers over the last few weeks when they should have been staying at home.  ‘many people i saw didn’t seem to be keeping two metres apart either.  'now weston general hospital has had to close its doors due to a covid outbreak.’"
health,"health officials have banned people from buying at-home coronavirus antibody tests that use finger-prick blood samples because they fear the results are so unreliable.  the ban affects superdrug, which is offering to test people for past infection with covid-19 using the same equipment that are now being used for nhs staff.  the equipment is being used wrongly, officials say, because it only has government approval when used with blood taken directly from someone's veins, not their finger. using the wrong type of blood sample makes it less reliable.  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra), which polices medicines and medical devices in the uk told firms and labs offering to test blood samples people take themselves to 'temporarily stop providing this service', warning they would take 'enforcement action' if businesses failed to abide by the rule.  but health chiefs were today accused of 'making the rules up as they go', with critics calling the decision another failure in britain's testing fiasco, which has seen months of delays and wasted money in the bid to find near-perfect tests.  public health england officials last week approved the first two antibody tests, made by pharmaceutical giants abbott and roche, which both claim their machines and procedure are almost 100 per cent accurate when used with blood from a vein.  the nhs scheme – which began on monday and is reserved for frontline workers – uses samples of blood taken by a needle in the vein collected by a nurse or a doctor, which are sent to a lab for testing and close to 100 per cent accurate.  private firms jumped on phe's approval of those testing processes earlier this month to start selling their own tests, such as superdrug - which quickly sold out of their £69 tests when they went on sale on wednesday.  confusingly, the lab-based equipment used to process the now-banned tests is the same as for the national scheme, but must be used in a certain way.  the decision by the mhra - a branch of the department of health - only concerns tests which rely on people taking their own blood from their finger, not ones which use professional samples of vein blood.  it is unclear how many of these have been sold already but it is understood to affect thousands of people. superdrug admitted only that it had received 'strong demand' for its tests.  sources say officials only became aware of the antibody tests being used this way in the past few days - even though private firms across britain have been selling blood kits for weeks online, some for more than £100 a time.  antibody tests involve taking blood and looking for signs of past infection, which is indicated by the presence of antibodies from the immune system. scientists have yet to prove this confers any form of immunity.  abbott, the manufacturer of the test being used by superdrug, is furious that its tests are being used with self-sampled blood, which was not its intended use. it has sold 800,000 of the tests to the nhs already.  it is not believed to be linked to a report issued yesterday by the us's centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), which suggested that even highly accurate antibody tests may be wrong up to 50 per cent of the time when used for an uncommon virus.  abbott, one of the manufacturers of a government validated test which is being used by superdrug, is furious that its tests are being used with self-sampled blood, which was not its intended use. it has sold 800,000 of the tests to the nhs already  the highest performing antibody tests use high-tech machinery to try to produce a reaction between a blood sample and a part of the virus to see whether the person's immune system contains the substances needed to fight off the virus. pictured: the architect laboratory instrument that abbott uses for its coronavirus test  superdrug has said it will offer refunds to customers who bought its at-home tests.  the high street retailer launched its service only a week ago - it had to stop selling them early because of overwhelming demand but has now been stopped in its tracks.  a superdrug spokesperson told mailonline this evening: 'we have contacted all our covid-19 antibody testing service customers today to provide further information about the quality and safety of our covid-19 antibody laboratory-based testing service.  'our doctors continue to support our customers with interpreting and understanding their results. if a customer requests a refund then we will organise it for them.'  the mhra has confirmed that it has the power to force companies to stop using the test - which it described as 'non-compliance' - if it needs to.  it said in a statement: 'when we find instances of non-compliance, in the first instance, we act swiftly to ensure voluntary cooperation.  'in this case, service providers have voluntarily paused their services following discussions with the mhra. we would only move to formal enforcement action where voluntary compliance was not successful.'  dr simon clarke, a cellular microbiology expert at the university of reading, said taking the decision to block the testing this late in the day was ‘really odd’.  at least half a dozen companies have already bought antibody tests and are selling them en masse to members of the public, many of whom are now unable to get results despite having paid for a private service.  dr clarke said the government was probably panicking that people receiving positive antibody results might believe they were immune to covid-19 and get brave about breaking lockdown rules.  he told mailonline: 'this is really odd. at least one of the tests validated by the government is commercially available.  'why they’re telling people not to use them; they don’t want people to be assuming that they’ve had the virus and are immune.  britain's covid-19 testing shambles: a timeline march 12: professor chris whitty announced that widespread coronavirus testing of members of the public would come to an end. the outbreak was too large, officials have since admitted, and only hospital patients could be tested within capacity. march 19: boris johnson promised to get antibody tests 'as simple as a pregnancy test' available for people to use at home - this is still nowhere near a reality. march 25: public health england's sharon peacock said the uk had bought 3.5million antibody tests and was evaluating them with a view to getting them available 'within days' - they were all deemed useless and were never made available to the public. april 2: health secretary matt hancock sets ambitious aim of carrying out 100,000 coronavirus tests every day by the end of the month. on april 1 the government had done 10,412. april 3: universities and private labs caused uproar in the 'little ships' fiasco when they revealed the government had turned down their offers to help with swab testing, to check who had the disease at the time. april 16: the new york times reported that britain had spent £16.5million on antibody tests that it no longer wanted to use. may 1: health secretary matt hancock claimed the government hit its 100,000-a-day test target, but it emerged that it had just mailed out 39,000 of them on that day and many of those may never have been returned or analysed. advertisement  'them not wanting to think that way is probably right… but this should have been put to bed earlier.'  he said that taking the decision now shows 'a lack of foresight that getting it wrong could cause problems'.  at least two laboratories are known to have stopped processing as a result of the 'guidance' from the mhra.  professor karol sikora, a former world health organization cancer chief, took antibody testing into his own hands at the rutherford cancer centres where he is medical director.  he told this website: 'in britain the testing is appalling. there seems to be no strategy and it changes by the day. they're making it up as they go...  'it's another failure. we shouldn't have got to this point in the pandemic and not had a properly worked out testing strategy both for the virus and antibodies. it should have been sorted out at the beginning.'  the finger-prick tests have never been approved by the government because they use a different type of blood to that which official tests have been validated on.  in the lab the tests use blood taken directly from a patient's veins, while the home tests may use blood from capillaries, which are tiny vessels carrying oxygenated blood through the skin.  this blood, because it comes through a wound in the skin, is more likely to be contaminated by the time it reaches the test.  tissue fluid from parts of the body surrounding the blood vessels, or substances on the skin, may mix with the tiny amount of blood and make it more difficult for the test to filter it accurately.  taking the blood properly is key - for example, the first drop of blood should not be used for the above reason - and unqualified people might be less likely to get a clean sample if doing it by themselves.  are tests less reliable when finger blood is used? in the lab the tests use blood taken directly from a patient's veins, while the home tests may use blood from capillaries, which are tiny vessels carrying oxygenated blood through the skin. this blood, because it comes through a wound in the skin, is more likely to be contaminated by the time it reaches the test. tissue fluid from parts of the body surrounding the blood vessels, or substances on the skin, may mix with the tiny amount of blood and make it more difficult for the test to filter it accurately. taking the blood properly is key - for example, the first drop of blood should not be used for the above reason - and unqualified people might be less likely to get a clean sample if doing it by themselves. professor sikora added: 'the real problem is, if you've got this in the post and never done it before, the chances of you screwing it up are high - it's just the way these things are designed. 'and people are nervous about pricking their fingers anyway. so there's a lot of inconsistency.' the finger-prick samples also only use a tiny amount of blood - usually just one or two drops - meaning there is more chance of the antibodies being missed. testing of covid-19 patients has in the past revealed that some of them with the mildest illnesses have levels of antibodies in the blood that are so low they are barely detectable. using a pure, larger blood sample from a deeper vein could increase the ability to detect these.  professor sikora added: 'the real problem is, if you've got this in the post and never done it before, the chances of you screwing it up are high - it's just the way these things are designed.

'there are several uk providers of testing services who offer covid-19 antibody testing using a fingerprick sample of capillary blood collected in a small container.  'we are asking all providers of laboratory-based covid-19 antibody testing services using capillary blood collected by a fingerprick to temporarily stop providing this service until home collection of this sample type has been properly validated for use with these laboratory tests.  cdc warns antibody tests are wrong up to half the time antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time, according to updated information from the centers for disease control. the cdc now warns antibody testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions, as even with high test specificity, 'less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies'. it urges caution with the test results as many false positives could lead people to believe they have an immunity to coronavirus and act accordingly. health care providers may need to test patients at least twice to give a more accurate reading, the new guidance posted to the cdc website adds. antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it. there is currently a high level of inaccuracy in the testing, however, caused by how uncommon the virus is within the population. if the infection has affected only a small number of people tested, it will have a magnified margin of error, the cdc explains. it means that even a test with more than 90 per cent accuracy can still miss half the cases if only five percent of the population has been infected.  'use of unvalidated sample types may lead to unreliable results and as such we are working closely with the service providers, laboratories and test manufacturers to resolve the regulatory and patient safety issues.  'people who have purchased one of these sampling kits, and received an antibody test result, should not consider the result to be reliable and should not take any action on it.  'this does not affect rapid point of care tests or laboratory tests performed using venous blood.'  the way antibody tests work is that a blood sample is taken from a patient, either by medical professional or by themselves, and that is posted off to a lab.  there, qualified technicians analyse the blood to look for antibodies for the coronavirus, which are immune system substances created when someone is infected with the virus.  people then receive a result in which the presence of antibodies - a positive result - indicates they have already had the virus, or the absence that they have not.  the lab analysis stage is now being blocked by the mhra because the tests are being used with blood taken by the patient themselves.  the best-known company providing antibody tests, superdrug, voluntarily stopped issuing its tests last week because of immense demand, so it could get through all the ordered samples.  it did not confirm whether the mhra rule had affected its service.  a spokesperson said: 'we have been contacted by the mhra and are in ongoing discussions with them about covid-19 laboratory-based testing services and the updated guidance provided by abbott.  'we are also contacting all our covid-19 antibody testing service customers today to provide further information about the quality and safety of our covid-19 antibody laboratory-based testing service. we are updating them on our current position together with inviting them to contact us directly if they’d like further information or if they have any questions or concerns.  how can accurate tests be inaccurate? antibody tests with what could be considered a high level of accuracy can still produce large margins of error if only a small proportion of a population has been infected. a 95% specific test, for example, will always produce five false positive results from a group of 100 people. even if it is sensitive enough to detect all the people who have genuinely had the disease, it will still return five false positives, and the effect this has on the results of a survey can be large if the number of true positives is low. if the prevalence of antibodies is low - for example, only 5% of people in the group have had the illness - the results could end up half wrong. the 95% test, in that situation, would be expected to return 10 positives - five of them right, five of them wrong. this means the functional accuracy of the test, known as its true predictive value, is only around 50%. the effect of these false positives is magnified if the prevalence of the virus in the population is low, and less noticeable if the prevalence is high. for example, if 30% of the population have been infected, those five false positive results would be counter-balanced by 30 true positives, making the test more like 85 per cent accurate. a more specific test can reduce this effect; by comparison a 99.9% specific test would return one wrong result per thousand - 100 per million.  lloyds pharmacy is also believed to have been affected by the decision but did not confirm this.  andy sloman, a managing director at the company, said: 'we are working closely with our partners and regulators and have taken the decision to temporarily pause the lloydspharmacy online doctor covid-19 antibody testing service pending further guidance.  'the health and safety of customers is our top priority, particularly during such a difficult and uncertain time.  'we are following the developing advice and guidance on covid-19 antibody tests from the government and medical professionals closely.'  professor ian jones, a virologist at reading university, said: 'in general i am in favour of freedom of choice as long as there is full information given on the reliability of the test performed.  'after all, you can buy any number of totally useless products sold under the vitamin or ""immune health"" type banner and the government does nothing.  'it’s worth noting that part of germany’s success in dealing with the epidemic was because of a commercial testing drive, in that case for active infections.  'the problem with centralisation is that it cannot cope with the numbers and that any teething troubles affect all samples.  'a disseminated system at least avoids this. it seems to me the issue is lack of accurate information about which kits are acceptable and which providers are offering them. then people can choose.'  a department of health spokesperson said: 'the government is working to develop scalable solutions for at home antibody testing. our experts are clear that an unreliable test is worse than no test.  'we strongly discourage organisations and individuals purchasing their own unvalidated antibody tests.'"
health,"advertisement  britain today announced 412 more covid-19 deaths, taking the official number of victims to 37,460 - as nhs data showed almost a third of trusts in england haven't recorded a fatality in the last 48 hours.  department of health figures show the daily number of fatalities is 13.5 per cent higher than the figure announced last wednesday (363) - and is three times higher than yesterday's (134).  officials warned the figure yesterday was much lower than usual because of a recording delay over the weekend and bank holiday, which could be behind the spike in deaths recorded today.  scientists who analysed the statistics revealed 10 nhs hospital trusts in england (7.6 per cent) have recorded no coronavirus deaths in the past week, as well as 38 (29 per cent) who have registered none in the past 48 hours.  health bosses also announced 2,013 more cases today, taking the official number of brits to have been infected to 267,240 - but the true number is estimated to be in the millions because of a lack of testing.  in other developments to the coronavirus crisis in britain today:  two households could be allowed to meet up from next week under prime minister boris johnson's plans for easing lockdown, it was revealed;  mcdonald's announced nearly 1,000 more restaurants will reopen for drive-thrus or deliveries from next week - with a £25 cap on orders;  british health officials have told companies offering covid-19 antibody tests to stop processing finger-prick blood samples from patients in the uk;  forty per cent of staff at a hospital in weston-super-mare closed to new admissions because of a spike in covid-19 patients have symptoms of the infection.  scientists who analysed the statistics revealed 10 nhs hospital trusts in england (7.6 per cent) have recorded no coronavirus deaths in the past week, as well as 38 (29 per cent) who have registered none in the past 48 hours  revealed: the 78 nhs trusts that have recorded no covid-19 deaths in the last 48 hours alder hey children's nhs foundation trust  barking, havering and redbridge university hospitals nhs trust  buckinghamshire healthcare nhs trust  dartford and gravesham nhs trust  east cheshire nhs trust  east sussex healthcare nhs trust  gateshead health nhs foundation trust  george eliot hospital nhs trust  guy's and st thomas' nhs foundation trust  homerton university hospital nhs foundation trust  kettering general hospital nhs foundation trust  leeds teaching hospitals nhs trust  maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust  norfolk and suffolk nhs foundation trust  north bristol nhs trust  north cumbria integrated care nhs foundation trust  north middlesex university hospital nhs trust  northern devon healthcare nhs trust  northumbria healthcare nhs foundation trust  oxford university hospitals nhs foundation trust  poole hospital nhs foundation trust  portsmouth hospitals nhs trust  royal devon and exeter nhs foundation trust  royal free london nhs foundation trust  royal surrey county hospital nhs foundation trust  sherwood forest hospitals nhs foundation trust  st george's university hospitals nhs foundation trust  surrey and sussex healthcare nhs trust  taunton and somerset nhs foundation trust  the hillingdon hospitals nhs foundation trust  the princess alexandra hospital nhs trust  torbay and south devon nhs foundation trust  united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust  walsall healthcare nhs trust  western sussex hospitals nhs foundation trust  weston area health nhs trust  whittington health nhs trust  yeovil district hospital nhs foundation trust advertisement  professor carl heneghan and dr jason oke, from the centre for evidence-based medicine at oxford university, said: 'today’s reported figure is 183 deaths in hospitals in england: 162 (89 per cent) of these were in the last week.'  and they added that 10 trusts had registered no covid-19 deaths in the past week.  these were: alder hey children's nhs foundation trust, maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust, norfolk and suffolk nhs foundation trust, north cumbria integrated care nhs foundation trust, northern devon healthcare nhs trust, poole hospital nhs foundation trust, royal devon and exeter nhs foundation trust, the hillingdon hospitals nhs foundation trust and weston area health nhs trust.  for comparison, that is the lowest rate for nhs trusts in england in a week. figures show 15 trusts had went a week without recording a single coronavirus death on may 22. and the number of trusts not recording a death for 48 hours has dropped to just 29 per cent, down from 44.3 per cent yesterday - which experts say is likely due to the weekend and bank holiday lag.  department of health chiefs have yet to announce the geographical breakdown of the deaths across the home nations, meaning it is unclear how many fatalities have been recorded in any of the nations.  individual authorities have different cut-off points for records to be submitted, meaning the tallies added up for england, scotland, wales and northern ireland often don't match the final breakdown given by the dh.  nhs england today recorded 183 covid-19 fatalities in hospitals, while scotland registered 13 deaths, wales 11 and northern ireland two from all locations, including care homes.  the figures are slightly up on yesterday - which experts said were low because of the compounded sunday and bank holiday monday effects.  processes for recording people's deaths are known for slowing down and even stopping at the weekends and on bank holidays, meaning there is a dip every monday - or tuesday if it follows a bank holiday - followed by surges on tuesdays and wednesdays.  it comes after it was revealed today that two households could be allowed to meet up from next week, under boris johnson's plans for easing lockdown - but ministers are said to have parked proposals for people to be able to mix freely in social 'bubbles'.  current lockdown rules dictate that you can meet up with one other person from outside your household outdoors as long as you remain two metres apart.  the new plan would allow two households to link up although it is unclear whether everyone in each household would be allowed to attend. this would potentially allow people to see their parents at the same time, for example, something which the existing restrictions prohibit.  it could see people given the green light to invite their partnered household to visit them in a private garden.  however, when plan was discussed at a meeting of the cabinet on monday this week, foreign secretary dominic raab reportedly expressed concerns that the two households plan could become seen as a 'barbecue clause'.  social bubbles of up to ten people was first laid out in the government’s 50-page roadmap out of lockdown, published on 11 may, and gave hope that people could once again see extended family or friends all together.  the 'bubble' plan was originally due to be included in the first wave of lockdown easing announced by the pm but it was held back after scientists said the potential impact needed to be better understood.  new expert modelling produced by the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) is believed to have shown that allowing households to merge in a bubble could lead to a fresh outbreak and is not possible at the moment.  ministers are now pursuing a more targeted approach which they hope will help people who have been left isolated during the crisis.  the scheme, which could be rolled out from june 1 at the start of mr johnson's second phase of easing, could force households to nominate the friends or family they want to be allowed to see.  a potential requirement for households to nominate the other household they want to be linked to could cause major headaches because it could force parents to choose which of their adult children they meet up with.  it is also unclear how such a scheme could work in house share situations where people may have different groups of friends.  nicola sturgeon has already said that in scotland two households are set to be allowed to mix in 'small numbers, including in gardens' with social distancing in force.  there is likely to be new guidance issued setting out how guests should walk through the house if that is the only route to the garden, too.  coronavirus is believed to spread more easily indoors than outdoors and there are concerns that the garden provision could be abused, with people ending up moving inside during a gathering.  the pm's spokesman said 'work is ongoing' on plans to increase socialising, and that ministers recognised that 'sacrifices' were being made.  'we are of course aware that not everybody has access to a garden,' they added.  meanwhile experts have warned that the government's contact tracing operation must be in place before any further easing of lockdown measures takes place.  it is now thought the initiative will go live tomorrow, allowing the pm to go ahead with lockdown changes like the phased reopening of primary schools and non-essential shops.  the contact tracing scheme will see people who have come into contact with someone for more than 15 minutes who has subsequently tested positive for the disease being tracked down and told to self-isolate for 14 days.  it is hoped this would then stop a second wave by breaking the chain of transmission early.  starting tomorrow, everyone who displays coronavirus symptoms will be asked to report themselves to ‘test and trace’ officials either online or through a new helpline.  their job will be to find, test and isolate these people and contact anyone who they have had close interactions with. family members, flatmates, partners and close contacts will be told to go into isolation for a fortnight even if they have no symptoms.  anyone told to self quarantine will be entitled to statutory sick pay, or if they are self-employed they will have access to government grants.  ministers have already stressed that the contact tracing programme (tti - for test, trace and isolate) will only work if people told to isolate actually do it.  health secretary matt hancock told the daily downing street press conference last night that people have a 'civic duty' to remove themselves from society if they are asked to do so by the programme.  'people are doing this, they are not doing it for me, people are doing this for their loved ones,' he said.  'if you are phoned up and asked to self-isolate even if you are perfectly healthy because you have been in close contact with somebody who has tested positive, it is your civic duty to then self-isolate for yourself, for your community, for your family.  'we all need to come together to do this and that will then in turn allow us to lift some of the measures that currently are blanket measures across the whole of society and have to be blanket measures until we have the nhs test and trace system up and running and in place.'  it comes as a study by the royal society warned the government’s contact tracing programme will only bring down infections by a mere 5 per cent.  ministers are believed to be considering plans which would allow two households to meet up outdoors. pictured are people enjoying the sunshine in east london on may 26  experts have warned that the government's contact tracing operation must be in place before any further easing of lockdown measures takes place. pictured: customers at portobello road market today  there are fears the south west is already experiencing some kind of second wave after an outbreak of coronavirus cases has forced a hospital in weston-super-mare (pictured, the town's beach) to shut  it is thought the contact tracing initiative will start from tomorrow, with details being announced later today  officials spark confusion by asking firms to stop selling antibody tests the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) has told firms offering to test blood samples people take themselves from finger-pricks to 'temporarily stop providing this service'. until then, people had been able to buy mail order kits for upwards of £69 from online pharmacies to find out if they have already had the coronavirus. the tests have been around for weeks online, including from lloyds pharmacy, and superdrug even had to suspend its because of overwhelming demand. they involve taking blood and looking for signs of past infection, which is indicated by the presence of antibodies from the immune system. but the government is thought to have become jittery about the prospect of people finding out they might be immune to the virus and ignoring lockdown rules. the mhra's messaging has caused confusion because companies have bought the same tests approved by the government - which will be used to test nhs and care workers from this week - but to be using them in a different way, which makes them less accurate. the move, which officials deny is a ban and say is merely guidance, led to critics accusing the government of 'making it up as they go'. one top scientist said it showed a 'lack of foresight'. dr simon clarke, a cellular microbiology expert at the university of reading, told mailonline: 'this is really odd. at least one of the tests validated by the government is commercially available. 'why they’re telling people not to use them; they don’t want people to be assuming that they’ve had the virus and are immune. 'them not wanting to think that way is probably right… but this should have been put to bed earlier.' he said that taking the decision now shows 'a lack of foresight that getting it wrong could cause problems'. professor karol sikora, a former world health organization cancer chief, took antibody testing into his own hands at the rutherford cancer centres where he is medical director. he told this website: 'in britain the testing is appalling. there seems to be no strategy and it changes by the day. they're making it up as they go... 'it's another failure. we shouldn't have got to this point in the pandemic and not had a properly worked out testing strategy both for the virus and antibodies. it should have been sorted out at the beginning.' at least two laboratories are known to have stopped processing as a result of the 'guidance' from the mhra. mhra officials met this morning to discuss the subject and are carrying out a review of the tests involved. it only concerns tests which rely on people taking their own blood from their finger, not ones which use professional samples of vein blood. the issue has only just come to light because officials noticed a surging number of these home tests being offered within the last few days, mailonline understands.  world-leading experts from the prestigious scientific academy warned the scheme will only have a 'modest' effect on the uk's crisis because testing times were still too slow and there was a good chance many britons do not adhere to self-isolation rules. the system will only work if the overwhelming majority of britons comply, the team said.  they modelled what effect contact tracing would have on britain' epidemic and found that, even if compliance is 80 per cent and the government speeds up its testing, the number of new cases will only drop by up to 15 per cent.  the report, by the data evaluation and learning for viral epidemics (delve) group, made up of 14 leading experts who give input to the government, has been handed to sage scientists ahead of the rollout of the contact tracing programme tomorrow.  in it, royal society academics urge ministers to focus their efforts on bringing down the average time it takes to produce a covid-19 test result. currently, swabs can take up to five days to be carried out, posted to a laboratory and analysed.  if this can be slashed to three days, then the tti programme could see infections fall by as much as 15 per cent, delve says.  nobel prize laureate venki ramakrishnan, chair of the delve committee, said the uk's scheme should by no means 'be considered as a silver bullet’.  the professor of structural biology said tti has the potential to ‘play an important part in bringing this pandemic under control’ but social distancing and stringent hand-washing protocol would be just as important.  professor anne johnson, an epidemiologist at university college london and a member of the delve committee, said: ‘one of the keys to success of any potential tti programme will be ensuring that it is carried out in an integrated way – joining up public health england, nhsx, primary and community care and the various other strands required to deliver a truly national effort.  ‘fast testing also allows those who are not infected, and their families, to carry on with their lives. there are many potential pitfalls for such a system and it is important that all of those are carefully considered in introducing such a complex undertaking.’  the tti programme will be supported by the new nhsx app, which uses bluetooth technology to alert people when they’ve been close to a covid-19 patient.  after some technical problems and concerns about data privacy, officials say the app is now on course for a national rollout within weeks, having passed a trial on the isle of wight.  other critical unanswered questions about tti - such as how self-isolation will be enforced - will be announced at downing street's press conference tonight.  there are fears the south west is already experiencing some kind of second wave after an outbreak of coronavirus cases has forced a hospital in weston-super-mare to shut.  weston general hospital has been closed to all new admissions, including a&e patients, since monday morning because of a spike in covid-19 patients.  it has been claimed a memo leaked to local newspaper somerset live revealed 40 per cent of workers at the hospital, which has around 2,000 staff, have come down with the infection. some of them did not show symptoms.  the trust that runs the hospital has yet to deny the claims after being contacted by mailonline, and admitted last night there is an 'emerging picture' of staff with no symptoms testing positive for covid-19.  silent carriers of the virus, who don't show symptoms, can unknowingly spread the virus to other people, with scientists previously finding up to half of cases are caused by asymptomatic spread.  the contributions of different intervention strategies in preventing covid-19 infections: s1 to s5 are increasingly stringent measures, with s1 involving no restrictions on social interaction, only requiring households of symptomatic individuals to quarantine. s5 reflects the current situation  the impact of varying delays in testing cases and tracing close contacts (left) on the reproduction 'r' value . the impact of varying compliance with steps in the tti system (right)  angry residents say 'it's not rocket science' - there has been an outbreak in weston-super-mare because crowds are unable to stay socially distanced at the beach. pictured: the promenade on may 25  all mcdonald's drive thrus will be opened next week mcdonald's has announced nearly 1,000 more restaurants will reopen for drive-thrus or deliveries from next week, under a new lockdown friendly measures with a £25 cap on orders. each franchise has been asked to make sure its staff are fit and able to work, following nearly two months of lockdown measures. from next tuesday mcdonald's will begin announcing the restaurants that have reopened. by thursday, 975 franchises will have reopened. footage shows how restaurants are reopening with protective screens between staff and customers. workers are also expected to wash their hands every 30 minutes. protective screens have been put in place inside the kitchens and at drive-thrus to lower the risk of contamination. for customers, the major changes are a reduced menu and a £25 spending cap, which has been introduced as staff get used to working in smaller teams and to reduce waiting times at drive-thru lanes. diners are also being asked to pay via contactless cards. a mcdonald's spokesman said: 'we can today announce that by 4th june, 1019 of our restaurants will have reopened, either for drive thru or mcdelivery. 'this means every drive thru in the uk and ireland will reopen between tuesday and thursday next week and we will start to expand the availability of mcdelivery too.'  the message reportedly sent to nhs staff in the south west region on sunday, may 24, also said more than 64 patients have tested positive in the hospital, up from 30 patients at the beginning of last week.  the cause of the outbreak has been shrouded in mystery, with locals blaming tourists crowding the beaches over the past two weeks.  trust medical director dr william oldfield said they are in the process of testing all staff in clinical areas at the hospital who may have had some patient contact.  'there is an emerging picture of asymptomatic staff testing positive for the virus,' he said.  dr oldfield said members of staff who have tested positive have self-isolated in line with national guidance and there are 'appropriate levels' of personal protective equipment (ppe) available.  local mp, john penrose, said the hospital was having a 'deep clean' after speaking to health chiefs.  he told mailonline: 'as i hope everyone would expect, i've been meeting local health chiefs to get to the bottom of this. they say the hospital isn't full and there are enough spare beds, but they're worried about cross-infecting non-covid patients, so they want to stop new arrivals until they've deep-cleaned it and checked all the staff too.  'they're running tests which they hope will reveal the truth of it, so we should know more once the results come in.'  mr penrose said there was 'no evidence to show if the outbreak is connected to visitors on the seafront', after day-trippers were blamed for a surge in cases.  but people who live in weston-super-mare said it was clear tourists who flocked to beaches after the lockdown was loosened were contributing to spread of the virus.  the beaches in somerset and elsewhere have been packed with tourists since prime minister boris johnson allowed people in england to travel as far as they like to enjoy unlimited exercise and sunbathing.  the south west region has so far experienced the fewest cases and deaths from covid-19 in england.  university hospitals bristol and weston trust (uhbw), which has confirmed 118 coronavirus deaths across its two hospitals. but it is unclear how many of those happened at weston general and its other hospital, bristol royal infirmary (bri)."
health,"number 10 'didn't notice' that the department of health had not announced the number of people being tested for coronavirus for four days running.  the prime minister's spokesman said in a briefing today that the omission of the statistic, which is usually published every day, was 'not something i have noticed'.  the last time the department of health published the number was last friday, may 22, when 80,297 people were swab-tested for covid-19.  for the past five days the department has simply put a note saying 'unavailable' in the section of the table it posts every day on twitter.  below that table officials note: 'reporting on the number of people tested has been temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting across all pillars.  'this is due to a small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test or tested positive for than once for #covid19 in pillar 2.  'corrections will be made to any figures if they have subsequently been found to have an error.'  the department of health has, since friday, stopped reporting the number of people being tested each day and the total number of people tested. it explains this is to avoid reporting errors caused by some people being tested more than once  at the last count on friday, a total of 2,144,626 people had been tested for the coronavirus since the outbreak began.  and today's update showed that 3,798,490 individual tests have been carried out, with 117,013 done yesterday.  friday's data of 3,231,921 tests carried out on 2,144,626 people suggests that, on average, one in every three people is tested twice.  there is a ratio of 1.5 tests per person, meaning every 10 people incur 15 tests, suggesting every third person gets a second test.  being tested more than once is not unusual in medicine and increases the accuracy of tests that may otherwise fall short of a perfect standard.  dr paul hunter, a former nhs doctor and now medicine lecturer at the university of east anglia, told mailonline it was 'valid' to retest people.  'because the test isn’t 100 per cent sensitive, it can fail for a number of reasons,' he said.  'some of these reasons are in the labs themselves, where there are all sorts of controls that may go wrong. sometimes the sample comes in damaged and you have to ask if the patient can send another.  'the other issue is taking a swab. the person who does this might not do it right – for example, they might not manage to scrape against the back of the throat. '  what is the swab test for coronavirus? nasopharyngeal swabs are used to detect respiratory viruses, such as the flu and the new coronavirus. it is the preferred choice for sars-cov-2 testing, according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). it involves inserting a long, flexible cotton bud into the nostril and along the nose 'floor'. this is supposed to be done slowly so that it is comfortable. the aim is to reach the posterior nasopharynx, a cavity made up of muscle and connective tissue, covered in cells and mucous that are similar to the nose. it continues down into the throat. the swab is rotated several times in order to get enough cells. the sample is then sent to a lab, where it will be tested to determine if the patient’s cells are infected with the virus. the coronavirus is a rna virus, which means it uses ribonucleic acid as its genetic material. a process called reverse transcription is needed to transcribe the rna into readable dna. a swab sample doesn't collect much rna in one go, therefore a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is used to rapidly make billions of copies so it can be analysed. the dna is dyed a fluorescent colour, which glows if the coronavirus is present, confirming a diagnosis. advertisement  one of the main reasons for multiple tests is likely to be because doctors don't want to misdiagnose someone as having - or not having - the virus.  if someone is hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms and lives with someone else who has tested positive, for example, they would be retested if their first swab comes back negative.  dr hunter said: 'it may be that someone has symptoms synonymous with coronavirus – they have a sore throat and fever which has come on suddenly.  'if this patient’s test comes back negative, the clinician might think something went wrong or “i better test them again just in case”.  'i personally wouldn’t criticise the government for including repeat swabs in their daily count.  'but it should only include swabs that have been examined in the laboratory – not swabs that are posted to people.'  swab testing is usually carried out by a medical worker pushing a long cotton bud through someone's nostril into the top of their throat.  it can be an uncomfortable procedure and it can be tricky to get the right types of cells on the end of the swab.  the coronavirus is most present in the epithelial cells in the airways, which can be found in the airways at the back of the nasal cavity, therefore the swab must be inserted deep into the nose and moved around.  the sample is then sent to a lab, where it will be tested to determine if the patient’s cells are infected with the virus.  access to swab tests has now been extended to allow some people to take their own samples at home and return them to the department of health by post.  some of these may need to be redone because people aren't qualified to do the tests properly and may not carry out a thorough enough swab."
health,"the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has updated its guidelines for when people who have had the novel coronavirus can safely see others.  according to the new recommendations, patients are allowed to meet with others after they've gone at least three days with no fever.  additionally, their symptoms need to have improved and at least 10 days need to have passed since they first noticed symptoms.  the updated guidelines come as states begin to reopen their economies and people begin considering going back to work and school.  people with coronavirus are allowed to meet with others after they've gone at least three days with no fever, new cdc guidelines say. pictured: a person wears a protective face mask in madison square park during the coronavirus pandemic in new york city, may 24  they can also safely see each other if it's been 10 days since they first noticed symptoms. pictured: a nurse wears personal protective equipment as she cares for a covid-19 patient in the icu at regional medical center in san jose, california, may 21  the cdc says people who test positive for the virus are still contagious so waiting 10 days helps symptoms pass.  'people with conditions that weaken their immune system might need to stay home longer than 10 days,' the federal health agency said.  if you are exposed to someone who had a confirmed case of the virus, then you must stay home for at least 14 days to see if symptoms develop.  'depending on your healthcare provider's advice and availability of testing, you might get tested to see if you still have covid-19,' the cdc wrote.  'if you will be tested, you can be around others when you have no fever, symptoms have improved, and you receive two negative test results in a row, at least 24 hours apart.'  however, not having symptoms or testing negative isn't a substitution for practices including social distancing and good hand hygiene.  'limit touching frequently touched surfaces such as kiosks, digital interfaces such as touchscreens and fingerprint scanners, ticket machines, turnstiles, handrails, restroom surfaces, elevator buttons, and benches as much as possible,' the cdc wrote.  'if you must touch these surfaces, as soon as you can, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water or rub your hands with sanitizer containing 60% alcohol,' it adds.  the agency also advises using contactless payment and trash cans with foot pedals whenever possible.  if you are using a taxi or a ride share, the cdc recommends opening windows to improve air circulation in the vehicle.  'limit the number of passengers in the vehicle to only those necessary,' the agency suggests.  'avoid pooled rides or rides where multiple passengers are picked up who are not in the same household. sit in the back seat in larger vehicles such as vans and buses so you can remain at least six feet away from the driver.'  if you are taking public transit, the cdc advises riding during off-peak hours, traveling six feet apart and frequent hand cleaning.  in the us, there are more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 98,000 deaths."
health,"the cause of a covid-19 outbreak in weston-super-mare which forced health chiefs to shut the only hospital remains a mystery.  but furious residents say it could be due to tourists flocking to the beach to enjoy the sunny weather - and scientists agree.  infectious disease experts also say the spike in coronavirus cases could be down to an unreported clusters of care home cases.  weston general hospital stopped taking hospital admissions and a&e patients from 8am yesterday, citing a 'high number' of covid-19 patients.  local media say it has seen double the amount of coronavirus patients in a week and reports claim up to 40 per cent of staff have recently received a positive test.  but the town's mp, who today confirmed an outbreak, said the hospital was 'not full' and had closed for a deep clean, while officials are 'running tests' to determine the cause.  the unprecedented closure of the hospital's doors has been blamed on day-trippers to the coast since the lockdown was loosened two weeks ago.  angry residents say 'it's not rocket science' - cases have risen because crowds are unable to stay socially distanced at the beach.  weston-super-mare's mayor even admitted 'you can't rule it out', when questioned if scores of britons on the beach were the cause of a surge in cases.  weston-super-mare's covid-19 outbreak remains shrouded in mystery - but scientists and residents say it could be due to tourists flocking to the beach (pictured yesterday)  angry residents say 'it's not rocket science' - cases have risen because crowds are unable to stay socially distanced at the beach. pictured: the promenade yesterday  the seaside town's hospital, weston general, stopped taking hospital admissions and a&e patients from 8am yesterday, citing a 'high number' of covid-19 patients  weston-super-mare is in somerset, the south west. the region has been the least affected by the coronavirus so far  weston general hospital, which has 250 beds, dramatically announced yesterday morning that it could not take any more admissions.  today it has urged patients with appointments to not travel to the hospital, and has also set out rules on when people can visit amid the 'temporary' shutdown.  a statement said the hospital 'currently has a high number of patients with covid-19'. but it did not provide exact numbers.  somerset live claims it saw a message reportedly sent to nhs staff that said more than 64 patients have tested positive in the hospital.  the message, which the nhs trust has yet to deny is fake, said only 30 patients had tested positive at the beginning of last week.  and the newspaper claimed the leaked memo said testing of staff, including workers without any symptoms, has revealed '40 per cent as covid-19 positive'.  weston hospital staff 'worried and confused' staff at the nhs weston general hospital are 'worried and confused', according to a major trade union. liz french, a representative for unison, told the bbc: 'they're confused, they're worried but i have to say they are pulling together to do their best for their patients and all their colleagues. 'it's not just the patients that have been diagnosed with covid-19 but also lots of the staff because they've done lots of testing over the past week or so. 'they were unhappy but they were getting on with their jobs.' ms french said staff felt there was a lack of communication from hospital bosses. 'although the senior management team were meeting every couple of days to discuss the way forward but that wasn't getting down to the staff. 'that was the biggest problem and that's why they were so worried,"" she said. advertisement  there is speculation the hospital is struggling to put protective procedures in place, with the message to nhs staff reportedly saying: 'discussions... have all concluded that there is no mitigation that can be put in place to safely manage and maintain operations at weston.'  dr william oldfield, medical director at university hospitals bristol and weston nhs foundation trust, which runs the hospital, said 'all hospitals have frequent changes in admissions'.  but the move came as a shock because only one other hospital has had to take such drastic steps during the outbreak - and that was a london hospital two weeks before the peak of the pandemic.  and the south west - which also covers the tourist-hotspots of devon and cornwall - has been the least affected region in the uk.  'the temporary closure of weston general hospital is concerning,' dr michael head, a senior research fellow in global health at the university of southampton, told mailonline.  'especially at a time when we are expecting to see new covid-19 cases to remain at low levels.  'it's difficult to be sure of the reasons why the hospital experienced this sudden increase.  'this could be simply natural fluctuations of caseloads that you can expect to see during an outbreak, or this could be a consequence of increased visitors into the town from a couple of weeks ago with onward local transmission.'  mark canniford, lib dem mayor of weston and member of north somerset council, criticising the 'total disregard' for the town's residents from day-trippers  professor paul hunter said: 'with the increase in visitor numbers – more people who are still infected are going to the town and spreading the infection to other visitors and locals'  why does the south west have so few deaths? the south west, which includes cornwall, devon, dorset and somerset, has had the fewest covid-19 deaths in england (1,157). this will be for a number of reasons including those based on the region's geographical demographics, such as the fact it is largely rural - with the second-highest proportion of rural population in the uk - and less densely populated than other parts of england. population density plays a significant role in infection rate, and therefore deaths. london has had 26,780 confirmed covid-19 cases compared to the south west's 7,524. data released by the office for national statistics on 1 may found the fatality rate of covid-19 is six times higher among those living in major cities than in rural areas. no rural area of england and wales had a death rate higher than 21.9 at the time of the study. the ethnicity, and income of wealthy and predominantly white south west citizens may partially explain the lower infections and deaths. the region has some of the lowest unemployment rates and highest rates of house ownership without debt, 2011 figures show. the ons study shows that once you take the age of population into account, the rate of deaths involving covid-19 is roughly twice as high in the most deprived areas of england and wales as in the least deprived. london - the epicentre of britain's outbreak - had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. in comparison, weston-super-mare has 11 deaths per 100,000 people. those living in poverty smoke and drink alcohol more and are more likely to be obese - all of which increase the likelihood of chronic health conditions. they are more likely to have key worker jobs such as in a supermarket, public transport, or in hospitals, which means they are more at risk of exposure to the virus than someone who is able to work from home. a report by the institute for fiscal studies (ifs) released in may found black and asian britons are two-and-a-half times more likely to die from covid-19 than whites, while an ons report said black people were four times more likely to die when taking only age into account. this affects how different locations are impacted by covid-19. for example, in newham and brent, london boroughs with high mortality rates, ethnic minority groups make up the majority of residents in - 71 per cent 64 per cent respectively. members of ethnic minority communities are twice as likely to be affected by poverty, and are often hit the hardest by chronic diseases. at the 2011 ons census, the proportion of white people in the south west region was 95.4 per cent, meaning less than five per cent of people there are from an ethnic background.  paul hunter, a professor of medicine and infectious disease scientists at university of east anglia, said: 'there are several possible explanations [for the hospital closure].  'first, it could be purely random – even if you randomly scattered new cases across the uk there would be some places that appear to have more cases than elsewhere.  'second, with the increase in visitor numbers – more people who are still infected are going to the town and spreading the infection to other visitors and locals.  'third, a super-spreader visited the town for work or pleasure. or fourth, an, as yet unreported outbreak, say in a care home that may have then spread outside the home.'  care homes have been shut to the public since the start of the outbreak. but it didn't stop at least four in ten care homes across the uk reporting cases of the coronavirus.  university hospitals bristol and weston nhs foundation trust said the closure was a 'proactive step' to keep patients safe.  weston-super-mare mp, john penrose, suggested the closure was not a result of a spike in cases, but to clean the hospital.  he told mailonline: 'as i hope everyone would expect, i've been meeting local health chiefs to get to the bottom of this.  'they say the hospital isn't full and there are enough spare beds, but they're worried about cross-infecting non-covid patients, so they want to stop new arrivals until they've deep-cleaned it and checked all the staff too.  'they're running tests which they hope will reveal the truth of it, so we should know more once the results come in.'  mr penrose added: 'at the moment there's no evidence to show if the outbreak is connected to visitors on the seafront or something completely different and, rightly, they don't want to speculate or guess.'  furious locals, however, have been quick to blame tourists who took advantage of the new lockdown rules, which allow people to travel anywhere they want in england and spend unlimited time outside.  the beaches in somerset and elsewhere have been packed with tourists, fuelled further by rage that government official dominic cummings recently broke lockdown rules but has not been reprimanded.  on facebook, one local said: 'people start flocking to weston, then cases spike in weston.  'it's not rocket science to work out that cramming on the beach, not social distancing has played a big part in this. stay in your own counties!  'many people would have gone to weston with the virus and a lot more would have left with it and will now be spreading it around their own communities too!'  locals told the sun they blame the spike on swathes of 'irresponsible' families travelling to the town for the early may bank holiday.  don trapnell, 56, who runs a beachfront cafe in the town, added: 'the beach has been absolutely heaving with people these past few weekends.  'they were coming from all over, some from as far as birmingham, which is more than 100 miles away. madness.  'you've got groups of friends and families all gathering here for the first time in months, drinking booze and their kids mixing with kids from other groups. it's little wonder the town has seen an explosion in the virus.'  it follows mark canniford, lib dem mayor of weston and member of north somerset council, criticising the 'total disregard' for the town's residents from day-trippers.  speaking to the independent, mr canniford said he thought it was 'unlikely' for the crowds at the beaches to have caused an outbreak. but admitted 'you can't rule it out'.  another local speculated ve day celebrations, on may 8, may have played a role because people gathered for 'socially distanced' street parties.  the resident said: 'they blame it on tourists but loads got together to celebrate ve day, and this spike coincides with ve day - it's not always tourists.'  it comes after experts said socialising on the anniversary of ve day was responsible for a possible influx of covid-19 cases - and warned that more hospitals could follow if the country does not heed official instructions to stay indoors.  dr bharat pankhania, a lecturer in public health medicine at the university of exeter, told the sun: 'they have got too many cases and it is unfortunate as it reflects what was going on two or three weeks ago.  'it is activities like ve day where people drop their guard that have led to new infections.  'if people start to drop their guard they will get infected and it will lead to a rise in the transmission of new infections.'  many weston-super-mare locals have called for lockdown restrictions to be re-tightened to protect seaside spots - and for people to use their common sense.  one said: 'this easing should have said no going outside your home county just yet, ridiculous and i feel worse to come after this last bank holiday weekend.  'the government needs to restrict this easing now!'  another added: 'weston didn't have the virus bad till boris said people were allowed to travel to exercise, now they are coming from all over the place.  'he is partly to blame for this, but also the tourists.  'use your common sense - stay local to your own town, not travel a few hours away!'  others called for more police presence.  one said: 'get police to stand around and stop all them stupid people from going on the beach - they're all selfish people.'"
health,"us pharmacy chains are preparing a big push for flu vaccinations when the season kicks, hoping to curb tens of thousands of cases that could coincide with a second wave of coronavirus infections.  cvs health corp, one of the largest us pharmacies, said it's working to ensure it has enough doses for an anticipated surge in customers seeking shots to protect against seasonal influenza.  rival chain rite aid corp says it has ordered 40 percent more vaccine doses to meet the expected demand,  meanwhile walmart inc and walgreens boots alliance said they also are expecting more americans to seek these shots.  it comes on the heels of a recent  poll that found two-thirds of americans plan to get a flu jab in the fall - though one-third in a different survey have said they don't want a shot to protect them from coronavirus.  us pharmacies are preparing for a surge of customers asking for the flu vaccine as 60% of americans said they either plan to or definitely will get the jab in the fall (file image)  nhealth experts say the flu shot won't prevent you from contracting coronavirus, but it could help medical professionals better fight the outbreak. pictured: emts transport a patient from a nursing home to an emergency room bed at st joseph's hospital in yonkers, ny, april 20  for the poll, the team surveyed 4,428 adults between may 13 and 19 and asked questions about their thoughts on vaccinations.  about 60 percent of us adults said they either plan to or definitely will get the flu vaccine in the fall amid the coronavirus pandemic.  forty percent of respondents said that had gotten a flu shot every year for the past five years, while 30 percent said they had not gotten one during that period.  the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends the vaccine for everyone over six months old  the vaccine won't protect people against covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus, but it could help healthcare workers better detect cases when people come in with non-specific symptoms, such as fever and coughing.  doctor also add that it could help prevent you from catching a flu strain that makes you more susceptible to coronavirus  'we're in for a double-barreled assault this fall and winter with flu and covid. flu is the one you can do something about,' said dr william schaffner, an infectious disease expert at vanderbilt university medical center  last year, drugmakers produced nearly 170 million doses of influenza vaccine, according to the cdc.  there were up to 740,000 hospitalizations and 62,000 deaths in the 2019-2020 flu season, which ended last month, the cdc said.  while health insurance typically covers the flu shot at a doctor's office and other groups offer free flu vaccine clinics, the adult vaccine retails for about $40.  global revenue for influenza vaccines is about $5 billion, according to wall street firm bernstein and, in the us, each additional one percentage point of americans getting the vaccine is worth $75 million in revenues to drugmakers.  cdc director robert redfield has said that flu and covid-19 combined could exact a heavier toll on americans than the initial coronavirus outbreak that began this winter.  some experts said creative ways must be developed to ensure that people are vaccinated against flu because patients may be less likely to see their doctors in person out of fear of getting infected with the coronavirus in medical offices.  pharmacies, public health clinics and other flu shot providers may need to develop drive-up clinics - popular with covid-19 diagnostic tests - for flu vaccines, said dr nancy messonnier, director of the cdc's national center for immunization and respiratory disease.  'my goal is that every single vaccine dose that gets made gets into somebody's arm to protect them. i don't want any vaccines left on the shelves or in doctors' offices,' messonnier said in an interview.  one reason for reluctance among americans to get the flu shot is that it does not always prevent disease.  this is because scientists selected the flu strains targeted by the vaccine months ahead of time, which are not always a perfect match for the dominant flu strains that season.  but the shots reliably reduce hospitalizations every year, according to experts.  'even if it protects 35 to 40 percent of the population, it's a lot better than zero,' influenza expert dr michael osterholm, of the university of minnesota, said.  in a survey commissioned by cvs health between january and may, consumers who said they will definitely or are likely to get a flu shot rose from 34 percent to 65 percent.  they also said they would increasingly go to pharmacies and less often to a doctor's office or healthcare centers.  some us doctors are also considering clinics in parks and community centers and even home visits for vulnerable patients, said david ross, vice president of commercial operations for north america at seqirus.  'as we look at immunization this coming fall, it will play an enormous role in this battle against covid-19,' ross said."
health,"british scientists have developed a coronavirus inhaler designed to help patients fight off the disease as soon as symptoms start to show.  in a trial launched today, researchers at university hospital southampton will send inhalers to 120 virus victims to use at home.  the researchers hope the technology – which uses an experimental drug that boosts the immune system – will stop people entering the drastic deterioration phase of the illness.  this is when patients develop breathing problems and are rushed to hospital. in the trial, patients will be assessed and tested within 72 hours of developing symptoms and sent the inhaler straight away to tackle the virus.  british scientists have developed a coronavirus inhaler aerogen ultra (southampton university)  if the inhaler works synairgen, the southampton-based firm behind the drug, hope to be producing millions of doses by the end of the year.  at the moment there is no at-home treatment for covid-19 and anyone who shows symptoms or tests positive for the virus is told to self-isolate.  the inhaler – which uses a drug code named sng001 – could make a difference by allowing sufferers the ability to treat themselves rather than just hope for the best.  the team have almost completed a trial involving 100 hospital patients, with results due in july.  but the new test which helps people at home is where the treatment could make the biggest difference.  study leader professor nick francis said: 'we are in need of a treatment for covid-19 that can be given to patients early in the course of the illness in order to prevent progression to severe symptoms.'  the patients who have a severe case of covid-19 tend to develop serious symptoms – such as breathing problems and pneumonia – in the second week after contracting the virus.  richard marsden, head of synairgen, said: 'we can stop people from having that bad second week.  sng001 contains a protein called interferon beta, which our bodies produce when we get a viral infection (stock image of an inhaler)  boris johnson had that problem – it was that second week when he was in hospital. that seems to be the pattern – it's about day ten when people are getting into big trouble.  they move from flu-like symptoms to being extremely breathless and having pneumonia.'  sng001 contains a protein called interferon beta, which our bodies produce when we get a viral infection.  interferon beta is already used as an injection to boost the immune response of people with multiple sclerosis.  but if the drug is inhaled via a handheld nebuliser – a device to turn it into a fine mist – it can be delivered directly to the lungs where it can help fight covid-19.  and from today, the trial will enable par - ticipants to use the nebuliser in their own home to hopefully treat the virus.  the sample includes over-65s – or those aged 50 and over with underlying health conditions – who live within 40 miles of southampton.  the patients with symptoms will be assessed via video call and sent a coronavirus test, which will then be returned to a lab at the hospital.  patients with a positive sample will then be sent a treatment box containing the nebuliser as well as a pulse oximeter, to measure oxygen saturation, and a thermometer to record their vital signs.  participants will take a puff of the nebuliser once a day for 14 days, at which point they will be assessed via video link.  doctors will carry out another call after 14 days to ensure there is no relapse. if the trial is successful, it will be up to drug regulators to decide whether a licence can be issued or further research is needed.  the researchers hope a strong result will allow the treatment to be rolled out immediately.  mr marsden said: 'we are aiming to be in a position to provide millions of doses later this year.'"
health,"have we ever been more focused on our health? people are stocking up their bathroom cabinets and first-aid boxes like never before. but which products really deserve their place? lucy elkins asked experts which over-the-counter products they swear by.  pharmacist  spray for a sore throat  sid dajani is a pharmacist in bishopstoke, southampton  ultra chloraseptic anaesthetic throat spray, 15ml, £5.99, most pharmacies  anaesthetic throat spray is a gem for a sore throat. lozenges can numb the whole of your mouth, which i find unpleasant, but with sprays you can target the exact area that’s causing problems. i use it myself.  i challenge patients to try it at the counter of my pharmacy and if their throat doesn’t feel better by the time they reach the door, they can have their money back. in 16 years, it’s never failed.  i don’t recommend a particular brand, as long as it contains a local anaesthetic such as lidocaine. (for example, ultra chloraseptic anaesthetic throat spray, 15ml, £5.99, most pharmacies.)  i also swear by care virasoothe chickenpox relief cooling gel (75g, £8.50, from most chemists) for chicken pox.  it contains glycerine which evaporates on the skin, producing a cooling effect that helps reduce the urge to scratch. proven to relieve irritating symptoms caused by chicken pox and therefore relieves any itching.  podiatrist  ccs foot care cream, 175ml, £7.99, boots.com  cream for cracked heals  michael abrahams is a podiatrist based at a&a podiatrists in radlett, hertfordshire  twice a day, i massage ccs foot care cream (175ml, £7.99, boots.com) into my feet, paying special attention to the heel area. this is prone to drying out, so the skin becomes thick and hard to remove.  in older people especially, deep cracks can form, allowing infection to penetrate.  there are so many foot creams, some quite pricey, but this one is inexpensive and contains 10 per cent urea, a compound that attracts water and intensively moisturises. it’s what you want to keep skin soft. i have been using it for years and i have great feet.  gut doctor  drinks with beneficial bacteria  peter whorwell is a professor of medicine and gastroenterology at the university of manchester  i am an advocate of probiotics [‘friendly’ bacteria which colonise the gut] and take one every day to help my immune system. the one i’ve been taking for 15 years is actimel (eight 100ml bottles, £2, tesco.com).  i started taking it when i did some research with the maker (i’m not working for it now) and i saw its studies showing how it can boost the immune response, especially after having the flu vaccine. it contains lactobacillus casei strains. some probiotics have also been shown to help irritable bowel syndrome and there’s some evidence they could help prevent infections leading to diarrhoea after taking antibiotics.  i take them in the hope they might reduce the number of colds i get. i can’t say for sure if they do, but i don’t catch many colds and i’m generally quite healthy.  there are some provisos to taking them, such as people with a compromised immune system for whom it may not make sense to swallow more bacteria.  actimel contains lactobacillus casei strains. some probiotics have also been shown to help irritable bowel syndrome and there’s some evidence they could help prevent infections leading to diarrhoea after taking antibiotics  ent surgeon  allergy spray for blocked noses  pirinase hay fever nasal spray, 8.8 ml, £6.99, most chemists  dr adam frosh is a consultant ear, nose and throat (ent) surgeon at the spire hospital in harpenden  for people who often suffer from a blocked, stuffy nose, as i sometimes do — or other nasal issues such as sinus pain — i recommend pirinase hay fever nasal spray (8.8 ml, £6.99, most chemists).  the active ingredient is fluticasone propionate, a mild steroid which helps to reduce the nasal tissue swelling, which causes the stuffy sensation. the prescription drug flixonase has the same active ingredient, so it’s like getting a prescription drug by the back door — and cheaper if you pay for your prescriptions. i use it myself.  nasal congestion can occur for numerous reasons, not just allergies; for example, dry atmospheres, or sometimes as a reaction to foods or alcohol [which causes blood vessels to dilate].  at night it can cause snoring, too, so i recommend taking a dose before bed and in the morning. if you do suffer from hay fever, then it’s also dual purpose.  cardiologist  supplement to combat statin side-effects  nature’s plus coenzyme q10, 30 capsules, £16.73, evitamins.com  dr sundip patel is a consultant cardiologist at lewisham and greenwich nhs trust and london bridge hospital  many over-the-counter supplements claim to aid heart health.  the only one i really believe in — because it’s backed by strong scientific evidence — is coenzyme q10, or coq10 (for example, nature’s plus coenzyme q10, 30 capsules, £16.73, evitamins.com).  this is an antioxidant [a compound that helps to defend cells from damage] with various uses, including helping to provide cells with energy.  there’s evidence it can also help to improve muscle weakness, a potential side-effect for people taking statins to lower cholesterol.  it’s thought that statins may deplete vital chemical levels in the mitochondria [the cell ‘battery’], resulting in muscle pain and weakness.  so if i were taking statins, i would also take coq10. i recommend my patients, relatives and friends to take 200 mg twice a day — it certainly won’t do any harm.  dentist  boots expert mixed interdental brush, £3.25, boots.com  interdental brushes  damien walmsley is a professor of restorative dentistry at the university of birmingham  brushing your teeth is vital for keeping the bacteria that causes gum disease at bay. but toothbrushes can’t get in between the teeth, so you need to use floss or interdental brushes.  i prefer interdental brushes, which you slip between the gaps in your teeth.  there’s some evidence they are more effective than dental floss. there are many brands; choose what works for you (for example, boots expert mixed interdental brush, £3.25, boots.com). you’ll need a range of sizes for the different-sized gaps between your teeth.  i use them morning and night after brushing my teeth. i’m proud to say i have virtually no gum disease, though i do have one filling dating from drinking sugary drinks in my university days.  apart from that, my teeth are all in very good condition.  you can keep interdental brushes for ever if you look after them.  headache specialist  fast-acting ibuprofen  dr andrew dowson is clinical lead for the east kent headache service  people tend to think that all ibuprofen is the same, but it isn’t.  the ibuprofen tablets or capsules that come with added lysine or arginine [both amino acids] or sodium salts work ten to 15 minutes quicker than traditional ibuprofen — an important difference when treating migraine.  ibuprofen is thought to work on neurotransmitters [brain chemicals involved in transmitting pain], but no one knows for sure.  the added ingredients help your gut absorb the tablets quicker, so you should take them when pain begins, which is what i do when i get migraines, three to four times a year.  use these to combat the onset of pain, but after that, or if the pain is constant, then you can revert to cheaper, standard ibuprofen.  using express ibuprofen (for example, galpharm rapid ibuprofen lysine, 16 tablets, £1.99, most pharmacies) might also reduce the amount of tablets you need to take overall, as it hits symptoms harder and faster.  the ibuprofen tablets or capsules that come with added lysine or arginine [both amino acids] or sodium salts work ten to 15 minutes quicker than traditional ibuprofen"
health,"british health officials have told companies offering covid-19 antibody tests to stop processing blood samples from patients in the uk, mailonline can reveal.  private tests to see whether people have already had the disease and recovered are now available from various online pharmacies from around £69.  superdrug became the first high street retailer to offer the service and numerous websites offer similar tests, including lloyds pharmacy.  now the government, which has previously been accused of trying to take control of coronavirus testing among the public, has slammed the brakes on private tests.  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) has confirmed it has told firms to stop analysing the blood samples people submit for testing.  'patient safety and public health are our main priorities and it is in the interests of everyone for antibody tests to be as reliable and meaningful as they can be,' a spokesperson told mailonline.  'there are several uk providers of testing services who offer covid-19 antibody testing using a fingerprick sample of capillary blood collected in a small container.  'we are asking all providers of laboratory-based covid-19 antibody testing services using capillary blood collected by a fingerprick to temporarily stop providing this service until home collection of this sample type has been properly validated for use with these laboratory tests.  'use of unvalidated sample types may lead to unreliable results and as such we are working closely with the service providers, laboratories and test manufacturers to resolve the regulatory and patient safety issues.  'people who have purchased one of these sampling kits, and received an antibody test result, should not consider the result to be reliable and should not take any action on it.  'this does not affect rapid point of care tests or laboratory tests performed using venous blood.'  at least two labs that process antibody tests using finger-prick samples are known to be affected by the move.  the news comes after public health england's testing tsar, professor john newton, last week urged people not to pay for private tests and to wait for official ones.  and it comes after us health body the centers for disease control warned antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time.  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) has confirmed that they have told firms to stop analysing the blood samples that people in the uk submit for testing  private tests to see whether people have already had the disease and recovered are now available from various online pharmacies from around £69 (stock photo)  what is an antibody test? an antibody test is one which tests whether someone's immune system is equipped to fight a specific disease or infection. when someone gets infected with a virus their immune system must work out how to fight it off and produce substances called antibodies. these are extremely specific and are usually only able to tackle one strain of one virus. they are produced in a way which makes them able to latch onto that specific virus and destroy it. for example, if someone catches covid-19, they will develop covid-19 antibodies for their body to use to fight it off. the body then stores versions of these antibodies in the immune system so that if it comes into contact with that same virus again it will be able to fight it off straight away and probably avoid someone feeling any symptoms at all. to test for these antibodies, medics or scientists can take a fluid sample from someone - usually blood - and mix it with part of the virus to see if there is a reaction between the two. if there is a reaction, it means someone has the antibodies and their body knows how to fight off the infection - they are immune. if there is no reaction it means they have not had it yet. advertisement  the government has bought 10million tests from pharmaceutical giant roche and will start using them on nhs and care staff from this week.  the mhra and department of health officials are expected to meet tomorrow to discuss the issue.  the way antibody tests work is that someone takes their own blood sample, or a medical professional takes it for them, and that is posted off to a lab.  there, qualified technicians analyse the blood to look for antibodies for the coronavirus, which are immune system substances created when someone is infected with the virus.  people then receive a result in which the presence of antibodies - a positive result - indicates they have already had the virus, or the absence that they have not.  the lab analysis stage is now being blocked by the mhra, mailonline understands.  the best-known company providing antibody tests, superdrug, voluntarily stopped issuing its tests last week because of immense demand, so it could get through all the ordered samples.  it did not confirm whether the mhra rule had affected its service.  a spokesperson said: 'we have been contacted by mhra and are in ongoing discussions with them.'  lloyds pharmacy is also believed to have been affected by the decision but did not confirm this.  antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time, according to updated information from the centers for disease control. a graphic reveals how the test can spot fewer than half of true positive cases, depending on how widespread the infection is  how can accurate tests be inaccurate? antibody tests with what could be considered a high level of accuracy can still produce large margins of error if only a small proportion of a population has been infected. a 95% specific test, for example, will always produce five false positive results from a group of 100 people. even if it is sensitive enough to detect all the people who have genuinely had the disease, it will still return five false positives, and the effect this has on the results of a survey can be large if the number of true positives is low. if the prevalence of antibodies is low - for example, only 5% of people in the group have had the illness - the results could end up half wrong. the 95% test, in that situation, would be expected to return 10 positives - five of them right, five of them wrong. this means the functional accuracy of the test, known as its true predictive value, is only around 50%. the effect of these false positives is magnified if the prevalence of the virus in the population is low, and less noticeable if the prevalence is high. for example, if 30% of the population have been infected, those five false positive results would be counter-balanced by 30 true positives, making the test more like 85 per cent accurate. a more specific test can reduce this effect; by comparison a 99.9% specific test would return one wrong result per thousand - 100 per million.  andy sloman, a managing director at the company, said: 'we are working closely with our partners and regulators and have taken the decision to temporarily pause the lloydspharmacy online doctor covid-19 antibody testing service pending further guidance.  'the health and safety of customers is our top priority, particularly during such a difficult and uncertain time.  'we are following the developing advice and guidance on covid-19 antibody tests from the government and medical professionals closely.'  the move comes after the government's testing tsar, professor john newton, last week urged members of the public not to pay for antibody tests.  professor newton, a medical director at public health england, told parliament's science and technology committee on friday that curious members of the public should wait until the government could carry out approved tests on them.  the government announced on thursday that more than 10million antibody kits were being bought from pharmaceutical firm roche for use in hospitals and care homes.  it comes after high street chains including superdrug began to offer a home antibody test kit for £69.  although the test it is using has been part-approved by phe, superdrug is asking people to take their own blood samples, which phe has not approved.  the test is still legal however, and people can make their own decision about whether to take it.  when asked about the new home tests, professor newton said better tests would be available to the public soon.  he warned: 'the public need to be aware that those tests are not the same as those we have evaluated and approved for use.  'the laboratory-based tests have a much higher standard of accuracy. we wouldn't recommend at the moment that people rely on the tests that are becoming widely available.  'my advice would be to wait until we have better tests which will be available in a similar form very soon, though they are still under evaluation at the moment.'  antibody testing has been ongoing throughout the pandemic and more than 230,000 people have been tested in a bid to try and work out what proportion of the population has had the virus.  health secretary matt hancock last week announced that early results suggested almost one in five people in london - 17 per cent - have already had the coronavirus, according to surveillance testing.  health secretary matt hancock last week announced that early results suggested almost one in five people in london - 17 per cent - have already had the coronavirus  cdc warns antibody tests are wrong up to half the time antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time, according to updated information from the centers for disease control. the cdc now warns antibody testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions, as even with high test specificity, 'less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies'. it urges caution with the test results as many false positives could lead people to believe they have an immunity to coronavirus and act accordingly. health care providers may need to test patients at least twice to give a more accurate reading, the new guidance posted to the cdc website adds. antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it. there is currently a high level of inaccuracy in the testing, however, caused by how uncommon the virus is within the population. if the infection has affected only a small number of people tested, it will have a magnified margin of error, the cdc explains. it means that even a test with more than 90 per cent accuracy can still miss half the cases if only five percent of the population has been infected.  meanwhile the rate across the rest of the uk appeared to be around five per cent, he said, which would equal 2.85million people.  but none of the tests have so far been considered good enough to diagnose people on an individual basis - to tell them the results.  tests made by giant pharmaceutical firms roche and abbott, however, have now been approved by the government and will start to be used on medical and care staff this week.  it comes after it was revealed last night by the us cdc that antibody tests for covid-19 may be wrong up to half of the time.  the cdc now warns antibody testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions, as even with high test specificity, 'less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies'.  it urges caution with the test results as many false positives could lead people to believe they have an immunity to coronavirus and act accordingly.  health care providers may need to test patients at least twice to give a more accurate reading, the new guidance posted to the cdc website adds.  antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it.  there is currently a high level of inaccuracy in the testing, however, caused by how uncommon the virus is within the population.  if the infection has affected only a small number of people tested, it will have a magnified margin of error, the cdc explains.  the way this maths works is that a 95 per cent specific test, for example, will always produce five false positive results from a group of 100 people.  even if it is sensitive enough to detect all the people who have genuinely had the disease, it will still return five false positives.  if the prevalence of antibodies is low - for example, only five per cent of people in the group have had the illness - the results could end up half wrong. the 95 per cent test, in that situation, would be expected to return 10 positives - five of them right, five of them wrong.  this means the functional accuracy of the test is only around 50 per cent.  this effect is magnified if the prevalence of the virus in the population is low, and less noticeable if the prevalence is high.  for example, if 30 per cent of the population have been infected, those five false positive results would be counter-balanced by 30 true positives in the 100.  a more specific test can reduce this effect; by comparison a 99.9 per cent specific test would return one wrong result per thousand - 100 per million."

'in most of the country, including areas that have been heavily impacted, the prevalence of sars-cov-2 antibody is expected to be low, ranging from less than 5% to 25%, so that testing at this point might result in relatively more false positive results and fewer false-negative results,' the cdc states.  'for example, in a population where the prevalence is 5%, a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity will yield a positive predictive value of 49%. in other words, less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies,' it adds.  'alternatively, the same test in a population with an antibody prevalence exceeding 52% will yield a positive predictive greater than 95%, meaning that less than one in 20 people testing positive will have a false positive test result.  'therefore, its best to use tests with high specificity - which are unlikely to throw up a lot of false positives - and in populations where doctors suspect there are many cases,' it concludes.  the way this maths works is that a 95% specific test, for example, will always produce five false positive results from a group of 100 people.  even if it is sensitive enough to detect all the people who have genuinely had the disease, it will still return five false positives.  if the prevalence of antibodies is low - that is, only 5% of people in the group have had the illness - the results could end up half wrong. the 95% test, in that situation, would be expected to return 10 positives - five of them right, five of them wrong.  this means the functional accuracy of the test is only around 50%.  how can accurate tests be inaccurate? antibody tests with what could be considered a high level of accuracy can still produce large margins of error if only a small proportion of a population has been infected. a 95% specific test, for example, will always produce five false positive results from a group of 100 people. even if it is sensitive enough to detect all the people who have genuinely had the disease, it will still return five false positives, and the effect this has on the results of a survey can be large if the number of true positives is low. if the prevalence of antibodies is low - for example, only 5% of people in the group have had the illness - the results could end up half wrong. the 95% test, in that situation, would be expected to return 10 positives - five of them right, five of them wrong. this means the functional accuracy of the test, known as its true predictive value, is only around 50%. the effect of these false positives is magnified if the prevalence of the virus in the population is low, and less noticeable if the prevalence is high. for example, if 30% of the population have been infected, those five false positive results would be counter-balanced by 30 true positives, making the test more like 85 per cent accurate. a more specific test can reduce this effect; by comparison a 99.9% specific test would return one wrong result per thousand - 100 per million. advertisement  this effect is magnified if the prevalence of the virus in the population is low, and less noticeable if the prevalence is high.  for example, if 30% of the population have been infected, those five false positive results would be counter-balanced by 30 true positives.  a more specific test can reduce this effect; by comparison a 99.9% specific test would return one wrong result per thousand - 100 per million.  antibody tests are used to attempt to determine whether a person had the coronavirus and has since recovered.  it differs from viral testing, most often conducted by nasal swabs, which indicates whether a person in actively infected with coronavirus.  the cdc said that the prevalence of those testing positive for antibodies among the general population is between 5 and 25, with higher figures coming from areas with localized outbreaks.  a positive test indicates that an individual has produced antibodies in response to a previous infection.  'the viral testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror. the two tests are totally different signals,' ashish jha, professor of global health at harvard, explained to the atlantic.  the antibody test does not definitively tell us whether those antibodies will protect that person from getting re-infected but according to the cdc, recurrence of covid-19 illness appears to be very uncommon.  that suggests that the presence of antibodies 'could confer at least short-term immunity to infection with sars-cov-2'.  while those who have had the virus are believed to potentially retain an immunity preventing them from catching it again, the cdc says that the level of inaccuracy of the tests mean that it should not be used for any important policy decisions.  antibody studies are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading but new guidance from the cdc suggests that many are producing false positive results  'serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about grouping persons residing in or being admitted to congregate settings, such as schools, dormitories, or correctional facilities,' it says.  'serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace.'  it also warns that a positive antibody test should not be assumed to protect from future infection.  'it cannot be assumed that individuals with truly positive antibody test results are protected from future infection,' the cdc says in the updated guidelines.  'serologic testing should not be used to determine immune status in individuals until the presence, durability, and duration of immunity is established.'  the cdc announced earlier this month that it plans a nationwide study of up to 325,000 people to track how the new coronavirus is spreading across the country into next year and beyond.  the cdc study, expected to launch in june or july, will test samples from blood donors in 25 metropolitan areas for antibodies created when the immune system fights the coronavirus, said dr michael busch, director of the nonprofit vitalant research institute.  dr busch is leading a preliminary version of the study - funded by the national heart, lung and blood institute and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases - that is testing the first 36,000 samples.  the cdc-funded portion will expand the scope and time frame, taking samples over 18 months to see how antibodies evolve over time, said cdc spokeswoman kristen nordlund.  vitalant, a nonprofit that runs blood donation centers and tests samples, will lead the broader effort, as well.  the cdc study should also help scientists better understand whether the immune response to covid wanes over time.  the cdc came under fire last week after mixing the results of coronavirus viral testing and antibody testing on a key national dashboard.  the move has the potential to derail state reopening by muddying a key statistic, because a declining positive rate on viral testing is one of the criteria used to relax lockdown restrictions.  such errors render the cdc numbers about how many americans are infected 'uninterpretable,' creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data, said jha.  'it is incumbent on health departments and the cdc to make sure they're presenting information that´s accurate. and if they can´t get it, then don´t show the data at all,' jha said.  'faulty data is much, much worse than no data.'  the cdc now warns that the antibody testing is not accurate enough for it to be used for any policy-making decisions. pictured, a sign promoting antibody testing outside medrite urgent care in new york city during the coronavirus pandemic on may 18  officials at the cdc and in multiple states have acknowledged that they combined the results of viral tests, which detect active cases of the virus essentially from the onset of infection, with antibody tests, which check for proteins that develop a week or more after infection and show whether a person has been exposed at some point in the past.  the cdc told the associated press on friday that the problem started several weeks ago when the agency began collecting data from states using an electronic reporting system that had been developed for other diseases.  at the time, nearly all lab results being reported were from live viral testing. but in the ensuing weeks, antibody tests expanded and cdc officials realized they had a growing number of those mixing in with the viral results, the cdc's dr. daniel pollock said."

'i was tested and it was negative so i thought it must be part of the shingles, so i didn’t think any more about it. until it gradually got much worse and i phoned my friend and said ""i'm really frightened, i can't breathe"" and she said, ""get to the hospital"".  'i was tested in a&e and that came back negative and i was tested again in icu that one was positive.  when asked whether she received an explanation for the false negative, she said: 'i don't think anyone explained, i was so ill i didn’t ask the question'.  sue (pictured) first began working as a nursing auxillary in 1972, joined scunthorpe hospital's newly opened intensive care unit in 1984 and became its clinic nurse manager in 1987  staff at the hospital revealed that they've had to rely on treating patients based on their clinical conditions as they've had tests come back incorrectly.  head nurse emily said: 'we have had a few cases where the initial swabs have been negative. but what we've been doing as a trust we've been going on the clinical condition of the patient.  'we've been treating them as suspected covid and re-screening as indicated and some have been coming back then positive, but we've been going off the clinical condition of the patient.'  she told host ben shephard (pictured) that after being tested for coronavirus twice, she became 'more and more unwell' but assumed it was symptoms from a previous illness  staff at the hospital revealed that they've had to rely on treating patients based on their clinical conditions as they've had tests come back incorrectly  sue first began working as a nursing auxillary in 1972. she joined scunthorpe hospital's newly opened intensive care unit in 1984 and became its clinic nurse manager in 1987.  in 2014, when sue was marking more than 40 years of working with the nhs, she told the scunthorpe telegraph: 'i love my job, it has led me in so many directions over the years and has allowed me to broaden my knowledge.'  her career has also seen her become a founding member of the british association of critical care nurses, and contribute to a book for newly qualified nurses the care of seriously ill patients."
health,"advertisement  mass coronavirus testing will cut down the sheer numbers who will need to be quarantined under coronavirus contact tracing, a study has found.  contact tracing, still in the process of being set up in the uk, involves identifying anyone who has been in close proximity to a covid-19 case and telling them to self-isolate to curb the potential spread of the virus.  the government has yet to clarify if people who are tracked will be given a test during their quarantine period. therefore, they may have to stick out a 14-day period 'just in case' they have the virus.  researchers have predicted hundreds of thousands of brits will be thrown into self-isolation every day as a result, which could wreak havoc on their daily life - after already spending months in lockdown.  a team led by university of east anglia simulated a pandemic with almost 470 people in the village of haslemere, in surrey, using phone data to determine movements and social circles.  they built an interactive platform where the public can see how the virus spreads in a town by selecting different scenarios - including how many people don't show symptoms.  across all of the simulations used, an average of 12 per cent of the population - up to a high of 15 per cent - end up infected, if the virus is left to spread uncontrollably over 70 days.  with contact tracing, nine per cent of the population would be infected. but 12 per cent of people identified would need to be quarantined at the most severe point of the outbreak in order to curb the spread.  if a high number of tests were available to haslemere's residents - reaching one in ten people - quarantined cases would be slashed to 1.7 per cent at the peak - and even less over the entire outbreak, leaving people to carry on with their normal lives.  to reach the same effect in britain, 6.66million tests would be needed every day. but currently testing capacity in the uk is hovering around a mere 100,000.  on top of that, the roll out of contact tracing has been embroiled in chaos. the contact tracing system, involving an army of 25,000 phone handlers and an nhs phone app, was promised to be up and running by june 1, when schools will re-open ahead of other rules being relaxed in mid-june, but progress has stalled.  a team led by university of east anglia simulated a pandemic with almost 470 people in the village haslemere, in surrey, using phone data to understand people's movements and social circles. across all simulations used, an average of 12 per cent of the population end up infected if the virus is left to spread uncontrollably over 70 days. with contact tracing, 12 per cent of people identified would need to be quarantined at the most severe point of the outbreak in order to curb the spread  if a high number of tests were available to haslemere's residents – reaching one in ten people - quarantined cases would be slashed to 1.7 per cent at the peak - and even less over the entire outbreak  the team assessed how the huge numbers of people that would need to be quarantined as a result of contact could be avoided under different scenarios  the researchers from university of east anglia, oxford university and the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine re-purposed data collected for the bbc four pandemic experiment (in 2017).  some 1,272 people downloaded an app which followed their movements. it gauged how many people the average individual comes into contact with at their home, work and other settings.  it helps to understand exactly how a disease spreads among a community, in this case, covid-19, which has killed at least 46,000 people in britain.  the researchers honed in on 468 people who had sufficient phone data over three days, showing everyone they had come within one metre of for face-to-face conversations.  they worked out a 'haslemere social network' and, using mathematical models, investigated how quickly sars-cov-2 would spread over the course of 70 days once one person was infected.  the journey of the outbreak can be seen on their interactive website, where a user can change the infection and intervention settings themselves.  the simulation showed if symptomatic people isolated – as is the current uk government guidance – an estimated 9.3 per cent of the population would end up infected, compared to 12 per cent if nothing was done.  contact tracing reduced it to 9 per cent but social distancing and testing people as individual measures failed to make much difference to the outbreak.  lead researcher dr lewis spurgin, from uea's school of biological sciences, said: 'our epidemic model showed that uncontrolled outbreaks typically resulted a significant proportion of the population becoming infected.  'we found contact tracing reduces outbreak size, but can result in lots and lots of people getting quarantined as the outbreak grows.'  the researchers combined outbreak control measures to show how effective they would be in tandem. these were displayed in illustrations.  researchers worked out a 'haslemere social network' (the blue lines represent one social contact between two people). using mathematical models, investigated how quickly transmission of sars-cov-2 would happen over a 70-day outbreak once one person (the red dot) was infected  this is an example of how one case leads to several more without any control (left, b). but quarantining at-risk people through contact tracing (represented by the grey boxes), it reduces the spread of the virus  this simulation shows how social distancing (cutting the number of blue lines) slows the spread of the virus as well as limiting how many people go into quarantine  huge numbers of people are expected to need quarantining as a result of contact tracing - but the study showed this could be avoided.  without any testing at all, 50 people (12 per cent of the population) would need to be quarantined per week in the haslemere scenario.  by ramping up testing capacity to 50 tests every day, reaching ten per cent of people, and therefore testing and releasing more quarantined cases, less than 10 people would need to be quarantined in the worst week - about 2.5 weeks in.  over the course of the outbreak, only 1.7 per cent of people would need to quarantine because a negative test result would free swathes of people.  however, a huge number of tests would have to be available if contact tracing was to be this effective in the uk.  with just five tests per day in haslemere, covering one per cent of the population, around 25 people would need to be quarantined every day during the peak of the outbreak.  social distancing had two benefits – it had a 'marked reduction' in the number of quarantined cases by 1.2 per cent, and slashed how many tests were needed.  dr adam kucharski, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, said: 'an important finding of our study was that moderate social distancing, combined with contact tracing and testing, could help control the spread of covid-19 while reducing the number of people who need to be in quarantine.'  even though this is a comprehensive study to predict how the uk's outbreak will play out, it is likely to be different in the real world.  models such as these rely on a lot of assumptions, including how much transmission is a result of asymptomatic spread, how long it takes for a person to show symptoms and how successful contact tracing is.  due to the rapid response nature of this research, it has not yet been peer-reviewed.  but it provides valuable insight into potential ways to contain the pandemic using data from real-world social interactions – something which has not been done in such detail until now.  dr spurgin said: 'we wanted to find out how contact tracing can be best used to stop the spread of covid-19 – not least because more disruptive interventions, such as lockdowns, cannot be sustained for a long period of time.'  dr josh firth, of the university of oxford and joint-lead author of the study, said: 'human social behaviour is obviously very complex, so it is important that we are able to see how people socialise and interact in real life, rather than relying entirely on simulations of social interactions within communities.  'going forward, real-world networks will be an important tool for considering epidemic spread, and our study provides new evidence into how contact tracing and social distancing strategies could potentially be combined to control covid-19 outbreaks within local populations.  'it is important to note the limitations of this study and the current state of knowledge – particularly that the social network here is taken from within a single, small town, and therefore larger-scale tracking efforts will be needed if we want to extrapolate these approaches to larger cities.'  a recent paper by from the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, led by dr kucharski, attempted to estimate how many people nationwide would need to quarantine when contact tracing comes into place.  estimates were based on the effects of manual contact tracing or the use of an app - both of which the government plans to use. but the team did not look at the effects of both methods combined, which would likely overlap.  they projected for every 5,000 new cases in the uk every day, 68,000 people could be asked to quarantine themselves each day if officials relied solely on a tracing app. but this dropped to just 54,000 people under the same scenario, if brits were limited to seeing a maximum of four people each day to contain the outbreak.  under a regime using only an army of volunteers to manually trace the spread of the virus, the figure was as high as 190,000 people a day, or 140,000 with a limit on the size of social gatherings.  when the same model was applied to 20,000 new cases a day, it suggested up to 770,000 people may be asked to self-isolate each day through manual tracing, or 580,000 if brits are told to stick to seeing only four people each day.  while the figure was in the region of 220,000-270,000 under the same scenario for the app.  the coronavirus is still infecting 61,000 people per week in england, according to data published by the office for national statistics on may 21. the true figure could be as high as 111,000 people every seven days or as low as 29,000, the data shows - and experts say the rate of infection is 'relatively stable'.  the government will launch a widespread contact tracing scheme to track down people who have been in touch with infected patients  contact tracing will also involve the nhsx app, which alerts people who have been in close contact with those who report having symptoms of covid-19  how many people will need to self isolate when contact tracing is in place? a recent study from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine (lshtm) estimate that for every 5,000 new cases in the uk every day, 190,000 people would be told to self isolate by contact tracers. it goes up to 770,000 for every 20,000 new cases. with just app-based tracing, the number of people that would need to self isolate reduces because an app doesn't identify as many people  ministers are set to combine different interventions – testing, social distancing, and contact tracing – in order to keep on top of the virus and avoid a second deadly wave.  contact tracing is being implemented worldwide because it health health chiefs stay one step ahead of the virus.  it has been a key part of the response in several asian countries that have successfully reduced case numbers, but has not been used in the same way in the uk.  contact tracing was used right at the start of the outbreak in the uk when they were only a handful of cases and public health england could somewhat identify anyone those infected people had been in contact with.  but as the outbreak began to spiral out of control, the method was ditched because cases were too difficult to keep up with. that's where the lockdown came into effect.  as part of its plan to prevent a second coronavirus wave, officials have recruited 25,000 contact tracers as part of what they say will be the largest virtual call centre operation in the country. these workers will pinpoint those who need to quarantine with old-fashioned interviews on diagnosed cases.  boris johnson announced in parliament that these 'manual contact tracers' will be employed, trained and ready to track 10,000 new cases of the virus a day by 1 june - when the uk moves into phase two of the easing the lockdown.  there is skepticism this system will not be ready in time before hundreds of pupils and their teachers return to schools up and down the uk, giving a feeling of unease.  health secretary matt hancock said the contact tracing smartphone app, made by nhsx, would be rolled out by the middle of may after a pilot study on the isle of wight.  but this has now been pushed back for 'several weeks', officials have said, meaning it's possible it won't play a part in the contact tracing scheme before the lockdown is loosened further next monday.  the app alerts people who have been in close contact with those who report having symptoms of covid-19, such as a cough or fever. those people are then asked to self isolate, although ministers haven't revealed for how long.  nhs confederation chief executive niall dixon has warned of 'severe consequences' if the government’s test, track and trace system isn’t in place soon, saying that easing lockdown before it is available would risk a second wave of infections that could overwhelm hospitals.  in a letter to health secretary matt hancock, dixon welcomed the news of the contact tracer recruitment but added that 'health leaders are yet to see detail on the strategy that underpins this' - referring to what sort of questions employers will ask people with the virus and how they will ask for phone contacts to be supplied.  'this is about saving lives and protecting the nhs, dr dixon said. 'if we do not set up the right system, involving local agencies, we will put patients and nhs staff at risk.'  the recent lshtm study predicted the success of different pandemic control measure, finding the call-handler contact tracers could reduce transmission by 61 per cent.  that's based on the assumption that 95 per cent of all people at school and work would be successfully contact traced and told to isolate.  the team estimated that with app-based tracing, spread would drop by 44 per cent - under the condition half of the public had the app on their phone.  the pilot study of the nhs app on the isle of wight saw just 35 to 40 per cent of residents install the app, but the researchers said they think it would be higher nationwide based on survey results.  in both situations, new cases could be limited even further if some social distancing remained in place and individuals had an inner circle of only four people. it would also slash how many people would need to self isolate as a result of contact tracing by thousands."
health,"one in 20 care home residents in london has died from the coronavirus, shocking figures suggest.  analysis of office for national statistics data revealed there have been 4.7 covid-19 deaths per 100 care home beds in the capital.  london's care sector has been hit twice as hard as the south west, east midlands and east of england, where the rate is 1.8, 2 and 2.1, respectively.  in the north of england, the new coronavirus capital of britain, there have been 3.2 fatalities per 100 care home beds, according to the health foundation.  the charity blasted the government for its too little, too late approach to care homes and say the crisis in the sector has been fuelled by 'decades of political neglect'.  at least a quarter of the uk's covid-19 victims have been care home residents, ons statistics revealed today.  analysis of office for national statistics data reveal there have been 4.7 covid-19 deaths per 100 care home beds in london - twice as much as in the east of england and the south west  percentage of care homes that have reported an outbreak: every corner of england has recorded cases of the virus in more than a quarter of homes  how many care home residents have died of coronavirus in your region? region care home deaths care home beds death rate per 100 beds london 1,654 35,340 4.68 north east 827 26,191 3.16 north west 1,899 62,129 3.06 west midlands 1,372 48,619 2.82 yorks and the humber 1,184 47,470 2.49 south east 2,109 85,503 2.47 east of england 1,066 51,841 2.06 east midlands 881 43,426 2.03 south west 997 54,584 1.83  fury as cabinet minister admits government 'chose' nhs over care homes justice secretary robert buckland sparked fury last wednesday by admitting that ministers 'chose' to protect the nhs over care homes because there was not enough coronavirus testing capacity. mr buckland gave the clearest statement yet that a decision was made to prioritise the health service when the outbreak was at its most ferocious. the government has been heavily criticised for sending patients back to homes from hospitals without tests, and not putting routine screening in place for staff and residents. mr buckland fuelled the row by conceding the government had to make a 'choice' about where to deploy testing capacity - which was languishing at a few thousand a day in early march, although it has now been ramped up to over 100,000. 'i think we needed to make a choice about testing and we did decide to focus upon the nhs,' he told sky news. 'the issue with care homes is that we've got many thousands of different providers, different settings, there have been lots of examples of care homes that have mercifully stayed infection free, but sadly far too many cases of infection and then death.' advertisement  between march 2 and may 1 there were 12,526 deaths in care homes where covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, out of a total of 44,000 victims.  around 340 care homes have had outbreaks in the past week, with four out of every 10 in the country saying they have had cases at some point.  looking at the cumulative deaths in care homes in england by may 1, the south east has been the worst-affected region, with 2,109 victims in its nursing homes.  there were 1,899 deaths recorded in homes in the north west, making it the second worst-hit area in the country, followed by london's 1,654, according to ons data.  in the west midlands, yorkshire and east of england, there were 1,372, 1,184 and 1,066 fatalities, respectively, by the start of the month.  care home deaths in the south west (997), east midlands (881) and north east (827) are trending towards four digits, the figures show.  the percentage of care homes that have been affected varies widely between regions, from 26 per cent in the south west to almost double (47 per cent) that in the north east.  this suggests that, while the total burden from the epidemic in terms of loss of life may have been greatest in the south east, the total spread of covid-19 in the north east may be greater than it appears.  a relatively simple explanation for this apparent difference in the total number of deaths might be the size of the care home population within each region.  in england there were a total of 15,494 cqc-regulated care homes in april 2020, with a capacity of 456,862 beds.  figures collated by the office for national statistics show how the number of deaths in each setting spiked in april, during the peak of the covid-19 crisis  however, much like the general population in england, care home beds are not equally distributed across the country.  while around 19 per cent of care homes are in the south east, only about 6 per cent are in the north east.  fiona grimm, senior data analyst at the health foundation, said: 'the government’s strategy for care homes stands in contrast to its approach to the nhs which has seen a more comprehensive and timely response to the pandemic.  'but the emergency that social care now faces is also related to well-known failings in the sector, including years of inadequate funding that is putting many care providers at risk of collapse, and staff shortages linked to poor pay and conditions.  'while no action plan could undo decades of political neglect, questions should be asked as to how many deaths could have been prevented had action been taken earlier.'  dr grimm said there was an urgent need for ppe and widespread testing across the sector to save hundreds more lives.  she added: 'the overall mortality data for care homes suggests that a government ‘action plan’ for social care, published nearly a month after the lockdown was introduced, has come too late to stem avoidable loss of life among both care home residents and staff.  'whilst there remains a lack of data at the national level to monitor these risks, the information we do have on deaths among residents and staff highlights the urgent need to ensure that care homes across all regions have access to adequate ppe and testing to protect both staff and residents.  'the sector also needs urgent investment to improve the collection of data, so local and national decision makers have the information they need to effectively tackle the virus.'  the government is under growing pressure to do more to keep the most vulnerable in society safe. health secretary matt hancock has pledged to test every care home resident and staff member in england for coronavirus by 'early june'.  care home providers are calling for residents and staff to be tested for coronavirus every week after research suggested asymptomatic patients were continuing to spread the disease.  sam monaghan, chief executive of methodist homes (mha), said the crisis in the sector would continue to burn because staff are unknowingly bringing the virus into care homes.  mha has had at least one member of staff test positive in 20 out of its 28 homes, according to results from a government pilot of whole-home testing,"
health,"dentists are set to reopen in phases to tackle the mounting dental problems that have arisen while surgeries were shut during lockdown.  the government is facing calls for dentists to be a part of the second phase of lifting lockdown.  if this goes ahead, dental surgeries would reopen alongside shops, department stores and shopping centres on june 15.  mp sir desmond swayne told the daily telegraph: 'i can’t see why dentists were closed in the first place, and i can’t see why they can’t reopen straight away.'  chief dental officer sara hurley has told dentists to be prepared for phased reopening, similar to that already seen in scotland.  dentists are set to reopen in phases to tackle the mounting dental problems that have arisen while surgeries have been closed during lockdown (stock image)  in scotland, urgent care centres that can see dental patients will be expanding first. this will then be followed by regular dentists.  equipment that dispenses aerosol gases will not be used because it makes it easier for the virus to spread.  last week it was revealed that a mother whose son, five, had a decaying molar during lockdown was told by a hospital dentist to make a make-shift filling with the red wax from a babybel cheese.  kate mansey's son ted was left in excruciating pain after a filling became dislodged.  after a dozen calls to their usual dentists, voicemails and texts to an emergency mobile number and calls to nhs 111, the emergency clinic at a local hospital called her back.  the government is facing calls for dentists to be a part of the second phase of lifting lockdown (stock image)  the hospital dentist explained that the red wax case of a babybel can be used to make a filling when it is ‘cut up, rolled into a ball, mixed with saliva and fixed into the hole'.  the dentist explained that the only alternative was for ms mansey to asses whether ted needed a tooth extraction under local anaesthetic.  james goolnik, a dentist in the city of london, said dentists are eager to return to work as more and more people are taking their dental care into their own hands or ignoring it all together, with dangerous consequences .  he said: ‘people tell me they have been using knives, nail files and trying to stick crowns back on with superglue but getting them the wrong way round.  last week it was revealed that kate mansey - whose son ted, five, (pictured together) had a decaying molar during lockdown - was told by a hospital dentist to make a make-shift filling with the red wax from a babybel cheese  ‘then there are some who have ulcers with no idea if they have cancer.  unless it’s a life-threatening infection, the emergency centres won’t see them. that’s not acceptable. as dentists, we’re frustrated because we want to help but we’ve been held back.  'we have ppe and we can work. we have been dealing with the risk of hiv for years and lots of other viruses.’"
health,"ian haydon, 29 (pictured), seattle, washington, is one of 45 people enrolled in moderna therapuetics' coronavirus vaccine trial  a coronavirus vaccine trial participant says he suffered a serious adverse reaction after a dose, but still wants people to get the jab when it becomes available.  ian haydon, 29, from seattle, washington, is one of several people who was given an immunization developed by moderna therapeutics at kaiser permanente.  he told stat news that his temperature shot up to 103f just 12 hours after his second dose was administered.  then, after being released from an urgent care clinic, he fainted in his own home, but recovered within 24 hours.  'i understand that sharing the story, it's going to be frightening to some people,' he told stat news.  'i hope that it doesn't fuel any sort of general antagonism towards vaccines in general or towards even this vaccine.'  haydon said that when he was given the first dose, he had slight arm pain and trouble lifting the limb beyond his shoulder, but he recovered within a few days.  after the second dose, he quickly developed arm pain  at around 10pm - 10 hours after arriving home - haydon developed chills and woke up with a fever.  his temperature climbed as high 103.2, and haydon felt sore and like he wanted to throw up, stat news reported.  after his second dose, he experienced arm pain and, later that night, developed a fever of 103.2f. pictured: neal browning receives a shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of moderna's potential vaccine for covid-19, march 16  following his visit to urgent care, haydon threw up and then passed out, but recovered within a few days. pictured: moderna therapeutics headquarters in cambridge, ma, may 18  his girlfriend called the 24-hour hotline that kaiser gave him, and she was told to take him to urgent care.  the pair arrived at 5am, where they stayed for about an hour. haydon was given tylenol and doctors recommended he go to a nearby hospital, but he wanted to go home.  after sleeping for five hours, haydon woke up with a fever of 101.5f. he went to the bathroom where he vomited and subsequently fainted.  his girlfriend called the clinic, who told her that haydon should go back to urgent care or call 911.  however, after a few hours of lying on the couch, drinking sports drinks and with a wet towel on his forehead, his fever broke, according to stat news.  within a few days, he felt back to normal.  haydon is one of 45 total participants in moderna's vaccine trial and one of four who suffered serious but non-life threatening adverse reactions.  few details have been released regarding theincidents but moderna did say that three, participants, including haydon, received the highest dose possible and had adverse reactions that after their entire bodies.  the fourth person was given a lower dose and developed a rash where the vaccine was administered.  haydon says although he felt sick during the ordeal, he doesn't regret enrolling in the study nor does he fear of suffering from long-term complications.  he says researchers are taking precautions and this phase, phase i, is to figure out what the proper dose for humans is so that that develop antibodies but not side effects.  'as we rush to get a vaccine developed as quickly as possible, the reality of vaccine development is that it can only be rushed so much and the trial still needs to take place,' he told stat news.  'they have to move at the speed they move at. and stories like what happened to me, they matter because they shape the approval process.'"
health,"the social distancing rule of two metres (6.5ft) may have to be trebled when winter strikes, scientists have warned.  chinese scientists found certain weather conditions allow the disease to spread further in the air.  their preliminary findings suggest droplets carrying the sars-cov-2 coronavirus can travel up to 20feet (six metres) in cold and humid areas.  however, a 1.4m range for social distancing — less than current guidelines — is sufficient to block at least 95 per cent of the virus irrespective of conditions.  it comes as boris johnson prepares to allow outdoor markets to open for the first time since the uk's lockdown, amid a continuing fall in cases and deaths.  diagram pictured above explains how coronavirus would spread under normal conditions. aerosols are smaller and lighter and can spread further than droplets, but droplets are believed to be more infectious (pictured)  the scientists from the universities of california santa barbara and stanford created a mathematical model to predict how the virus would spread under different weather conditions.  in each case covid-19 was launched at a speed of 4.1 m/s, the same as would be seen if it was released from the mouth as someone speaks.  they found that without stricter social distancing, covid-19's spread is likely to accelerate over the winter months.  'the transmitting pathway of covid-19 through respiratory droplets is divided into short-range droplet contacts and long-range aerosol exposure,' the scientists write in their study.  'we show that the effect of weather conditions is not monotonic: low temperature and high humidity facilitate droplet contact transmission, while high temperature and low humidity promote the formation of aerosol particles and accumulation of particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (pm2.5).  'our model suggests that the 6 ft of social distance recommended by the center for disease control and prevention (cdc) may be insufficient in certain environmental conditions, as the droplet spreading distance can be as long as 6 m (19.7 ft) in cold and humid weather.'  but they also pointed out a number of limitations in the paper, which was published as a pre-print in medrxiv and has not yet been peer-reviewed.  people pictured visiting brighton beach during the uk's bank holiday yesterday. scientists warn that summer poses its own risks to public health as the summer heat, which is often dry, can cause the droplets — deemed the primary form of transmission — to evaporate and form aerosols which can spread further  they said further data was needed to make definitive conclusions and because weather conditions do not always have the same impact on the virus.  they also called for more attention to building ventilation systems, which could unwittingly spread the virus among employees.  the warning comes as the uk inches ever closer to ending its lockdown.  shops are also set to soon re-open with no seating and one-way walk through systems.  britain recorded 134 more coronavirus deaths today, as its curve continued to flatten signalling a possible end to the pandemic.  however, the scientists warn that summer poses its own risks to public health  they write in their paper that the summer heat, which is often dry, can cause the droplets — deemed the primary form of transmission — to evaporate.  when this happens they form aerosol particles, which are lighter and capable of longer range transmission.  these measure just 2.5 micrometres across and are so small they can infiltrate deep into the body's respiratory system. these aerosols also have a 'longer suspension time in hot and dry weather', the authors say."
health,"boeing and airbus are studying how coronavirus may spread on their airplanes, and taking a no-stone-unturned approach to developing a way to minimize risks as they search for a way to restart business amid the pandemic.  they're trying to pinpoint how the virus moves inside a plane cabin, and experimenting with using ultraviolet (uv) light to kill any particles left on surfaces by infected passengers.  the companies have reached out to academics, doctors engineers, private companies and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) to aid their efforts, according to the wall street journal.  air travel has plummeted as health officials worldwide attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus, which criss-crossed the globe with alarming speed as it traveled from country to country on planes carrying infected passengers.  despite the highly efficient air circulation technology in planes, there's currently no way to ensure social distancing on planes.  all major us airlines are now requiring passengers to wear masks on flights, but social distancing is nearly impossible to do thoroughly on flights, so boeing and airbus are now studying how, exactly, coronavirus might spread on their airplanes  boeing is working with cu boulder scientists on the use of uv light to disinfect their airplanes  social distancing has proven an effective method of slowing the spread of coronavirus.  infection tracking now clearly shows that the virus's toll has remained lower in parts of the world that introduced the restrictions on contact earlier on in the pandemic.  but there simply isn't space for social distancing on planes, where rows of seats are about 30 inches apart.  putting six feet of space between passengers - at least front-to-back - would require leaving two rows empty between each set of travelers.  boeing and airbus are hoping to find a more finely tuned solution, by closely studying exactly how the virus behaves inside planes.  the first step is to find out how the virus moves on planes.  planes are equipped with high-powered ventilation systems that replace all of the air in the cabin about 15 times in an hour.  they're specifically and effectively designed to remove bacteria and viruses from the air.  but the concern is that a nearby passenger's cough or sneeze could infect someone long before the air is filtered out.  ventilation in planes completely replaces the cabin's air 15 times an hour, but that still may not be enough to protect passengers sitting near someone infectious. pictured: passengers seated less than six feet apart on an american airlines flight on may 3  previous studies of sars - another coronavirus that triggered epidemics across the globe in 2002 and 2003 - found that passengers seated near someone who was infected were at higher risk of catching the disease than those sitting further away.  the same may be true for sars-cov-2, which causes covid-19, but the airliners are seeking researchers to make specific mathematical models of the new virus's spread on their planes, according to the wall street journal.  a second and equally important phase of their studies will be to identify ways to prevent the in-flight spread of coronavirus.  studies continue to support the ability of masks - even cloth ones - to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and experts recommend that the face coverings should be required for air travel.  currently, all major airlines are requiring masks.  'if everyone's wearing a mask, then there is very little that is getting out into the air,' virginia tech engineering professor linsey marr told the wall street journal. marr said she's consulted with airbus on the issue.  meanwhile, the metropolitan transportation authority is preparing to trial ultraviolet light technology that could rid subway cars of coronavirus. a demonstration of disinfecting technology is seen at the corona maintenance facility in new york city on tuesday  cleaning and disinfecting will also be high priorities.  last week, the cdc gave americans a small measure of reassurance as it said that surfaces are not a primary mode of transmission for coronavirus.  but that doesn't mean that catching it from a plane seat, arm rest, tray table, screen or lavatory is altogether impossible.  boeing expressed interest in using ultraviolet light to rid its planes of coronavirus.  dr karl linden, an environmental engineer at the university of colorado, boulder, told the wall street journal that boeing had contacted him about his work, and wants to 'move really quickly,' to identify the right dosage of uv light to safely eliminate coronavirus on planes.  the method is already being tried in new york city, where the metropolitan transit authority is conducting a trial using uv light to disinfect subway cars.  it's an urgent need for airlines. air travel declined by 96 percent amid the the pandemic as of last month, according to tsa statistics.  but this month, air travel has ticked up significantly.  in april, there were just 10 full seats on an average domestic flight in the us. this month, that number increased to 39.  mask requirements will undoubtedly help stop the spread of coronavirus on us flights, but as travel continues slowly pick back up, airlines like boeing and airbus are eager to be ahead of the possible risks."
health,"researchers at stanford university are being accused of 'tipping the scale' on their antibody study and implying coronavirus is more widespread - but less fatal - than previously thought.  last month, their analysis found that between 2.5 and 5.2 percent of santa clara county residents tested positive for antibodies. that meant the number of infected americans in the county was 50 to 80 times higher than officials had reported.  but it was not peer-reviewed, many noticed the way calculations were made was not explained, and several found mistakes in the methodology.  in version 2, the team walked back its earlier estimates and said only 2.8 percent of santa clara residents contracted the virus but didn't know they were ill.  that's 54 times more than the 956 confirmed cases that had been counted in the area as of april 1.  the university is now investigating the research to see if the analysts was, in fact, politically motivated, inaccurate and misleading.  last month, a team from stanford university found that between 2.5% and 5.2% of santa clara county residents tested positive for coronavirus antibodies with results later being revised. pictured: a stanford laboratory scientist prepares reagents for testing covid-19 antibodies  the research was performed by drs jayanta bhattacharya (left), john ioannidis (center) and eran bendavid (right), who are now under investigation by the university for making the virus appear more widespread but less deadly than believed  scientists say this is becoming far too common with studies published before peer review, which are not subject to scrutiny. pictured: nurse katie canina cares for a patient in the special pathogens unit icu at brigham and women's hospital in boston, massachusetts, april 27  the findings, published by drs jayanta bhattacharya, john ioannidis and eran bendavid, were astounding because it meant the virus was much more widespread and that the death toll was much lower than believed.  however, not long after version 1 came out, criticism started pouring in.  some experts critiqued the antibody test the researchers used, which was not approved by the us food and drug administration.  others said that, because volunteers were recruited via facebook, the participants were not random nor representative of the county.  additionally, the raw percentage of people who tested positive for antibodies was 1.5 percent, which would mean the true number of infections is only 30 times higher than reported.  a few weeks later, the revision was published saying that the estimated rate of infection was on the low end of their initial predictions.  the university says it is currently reviewing the study and the authors over the recent concerns.  'stanford medicine is aware of serious concerns related to the santa clara county seroprevalence study,' spokeswoman julie greicius told dailymail.com.  'the integrity of stanford medicine’s research is core to our mission. when we receive concerns such as this, they are taken extremely seriously. this matter is being reviewed by the appropriate oversight mechanisms at stanford.'  the team defends its work, saying it followed all standard practices and that no political biases were at play.  as the covid-19 pandemic has continue to rage on, hundreds of researchers have been publishing preprints - a first draft of scientific findings.  preprints are a way to share preliminary results very quickly with others in the scientific community to understand this new virus.  however, the work is often flawed because it is not peer-reviewed and, therefore, not subject to the scrutiny of other researchers.  an analysis from northeastern university found that more than 10,000 papers related to the novel coronavirus have been published since january.  by comparison, just 29 studies were published before the sars pandemic of 2002-2003 was over.  'until something is, if you will, reconfirmed, it's just interesting but it's not definitive,' arthur caplan, a bioethics professor in the department of population health at nyu school of medicine, told dailymail.com  'when someone announces initial results, it's really important to swing wide for comment and assessment by people who maybe didn't peer-review but maybe offer some perspective.'  caplan said the pandemic has led to 'panic science' with the majority of the scientific community performing research and not as many to review.  'in general, this kind of panicky science leads to lower quality, too much speed, partial results getting results, no peer review, early pre-print publication,' he said."
health,"advertisement  matt hancock today called remdesivir the 'biggest step forward' in treating covid-19 since the outbreak spiralled out of control, after the ebola drug became the first medicine approved for coronavirus patients in britain.  the health secretary praised the drug, which must be injected by a trained medic, saying scientific studies have already shown promising results and suggest it may speed up people's time to recovery by four days.  announcing the approval of the drug in tonight's downing street press conference, he said: 'this is probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis begun.  'these are early steps but we're determined to support the science and back the projects that show promise. as you can understand, we'll be prioritising the use of this treatment where it can provide the greatest benefit.'  adults and teenagers battling severe bouts of covid-19 will be allowed to get remdesivir if they fit specific criteria, officials announced this morning. doctors are expected to decide on a case-by-case basis.  this makes the drug, which destroys a part of the sars-cov-2 virus to stop it reproducing, the closest thing nhs doctors have to a cure or treatment for the life-threatening disease.  britain's approval of remdesivir has come more than three weeks after the fda in the us gave it the green light on may 1, putting the uk weeks behind once again. it was also slower to increase testing capacity.  japan's ministry of health also approved the drug - developed by drugs giant gilead sciences - on may 8. britain is now following suit in the face of growing scientific evidence.  remdesivir - considered the most promising out of a number of antivirals - is expected to be available immediately to critically-ill patients over the age of 12 across england, wales, scotland and northern ireland.  the health secretary praised the drug in tonight's downing street press conference, saying studies have already shown promising results  remdesivir may be the closest thing doctors currently have to a cure for the coronavirus, after trials showed it can shave days off patients' recovery times  lord james bethell, government minister for innovation, said: 'this shows fantastic progress.  'as we navigate this unprecedented period, we must be on the front foot of the latest medical advancements, while always ensuring patient safety remains a top priority.  'the latest, expert scientific advice is at the heart of every decision we make, and we will continue to monitor remdesivir’s success in clinical trials across the country to ensure the best results for uk patients.'  remdesivir, which is produced by the california-based company gilead sciences, has been approved under the early access to medicines scheme (eams).  britain's medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) gave the go-ahead for nhs doctors to use it on people who are seriously ill with covid-19.  officials said: 'allocation of the drug will be based on expert clinical advice and will take into consideration the situation where it is most likely to provide the greatest benefit.'  what treatments are available for covid-19 patients? until today there were no drugs that had been approved specifically for the purpose of treating patients with covid-19. doctors have been trying to save people with serious infections by giving them oxygen therapy - such as through masks, or ventilators for the most sick - and generic attempts to manage the infection. this may include trying to calm down the immune system if it is over-reacting, treating the symptoms such as pain and difficulty breathing, and using antibiotics, antiviral or antifungal drugs to prevent secondary infections and to try and boost the immune system. for many, it is a case of experimenting and hoping for the best. advertisement  the mhra's green light means the drug can be used before it has been officially licensed for prescription.  usually, drugs have to go through lengthy testing and approval processes which take into account large amounts of scientific evidence and cost-effectiveness.  remdesivir is the first medication to get approval for use outside of a clinical trial in the uk.  it is an anti-viral drug that works by crippling an enzyme called rna polymerase, which is vital for the virus to reproduce and spread. by damaging this, the drug may be able to stop the coronavirus in its tracks.  dr stephen griffin, a medicine professor at the university of leeds, welcomed the news that it was now available and said it is 'perhaps the most promising direct-acting antiviral drug'.  he said: 'the drug mimics the building blocks used by both our own cells and sars-cov2 to build new genomic material, yet it is only recognised by the viral machinery concerned with this process, so causing profound disruption to this essential viral process.  which countries have approved remdesivir for treating covid-19? the czech republic became the first country to permit the use of remdesivir on march 17, agreeing to a six-month deal to give doctors the option of giving the drug to patients who are critically ill. us health officials followed suit on march 19, when they approved the 'compassionate use' of remdesivir and the controversial chloroquine on critically-ill coronavirus patients. the us food and drug administration rubber-stamped the approval on may 1, announcing the drug could be given to hospitalised patients under 'emergency use' rules. japan's ministry of health also approved the drug - developed by drugs giant gilead sciences - on may 8, making it the country's first drug authorised to be given to patients. european health chiefs at the ema updated their recommendations to call for more doctors across the continent to use remdesivir on compassionate grounds while they continue to review the drug.  'rolling out remdesivir... will likely mean that the most severe covid-19 patients will receive it first.  'whilst this is clearly the most ethically sound approach, it also means that we ought not to expect the drug to immediately act as a magic bullet.  'we can instead hope for improved recovery rates and a reduction in patient mortality, which we hope will benefit as many patients as possible.  'more pronounced benefit is likely to be seen when treating patients with less severe disease, ideally before they require invasive respiratory support, but this will only follow once the drug is more widely available and will be guided by the final outcomes of ongoing placebo-controlled trials.'  dr griffin added that the fact remdesivir must be injected means it will probably never be used by the general public to prevent infection.  other drugs which work against the coronavirus in different ways are being used on nhs patients are part of clinical trials, but these are much less available.  only limited numbers of people can be enrolled in trials and only certain people - usually otherwise healthy patients - are eligible for them.  for those who do make it onto trials there is often still a 50/50 chance that they get a placebo - a fake drug - anyway.  the two major clinical trials under way in britain are named recovery and remap-cap.  on recovery, which is being led by the university of oxford but taking place across the country, patients may be given one of the following drugs:  what other drugs are being tested? only limited numbers of people can be enrolled in trials and only certain people - usually otherwise healthy patients - are eligible for them. for those who do make it onto trials there is often still a 50/50 chance that they get a placebo - a fake drug - anyway. these are some of the medicines being trialled on covid-19 patients in the uk: lopinavir-ritonavir (normally used to treat hiv)  dexamethasone (a steroid)  azithromycin (pneumonia; lyme disease; chlamydia)  tocilizumab (rheumatoid arthritis)  hydroxychloroquine (malaria prevention; lupus; rheumatoid arthritis)  convalescent plasma (blood from a recovered patient)  bemcentinib (cancer)  medi3506 (chronic pulmonary obstructive disease; diabetic kidney disease)  acalabrutinib (cancers lymphoma and leukaemia)  lopinavir-ritonavir (normally used to treat hiv)  dexamethasone (a steroid)  azithromycin (pneumonia; lyme disease; chlamydia)  tocilizumab (rheumatoid arthritis)  hydroxychloroquine (malaria prevention; lupus; rheumatoid arthritis)  doctors are also testing whether people benefit from a treatment called convalescent plasma, in which patients are given part of the blood of someone who has already recovered from the virus.  this, it is hoped, could introduce the antibodies - disease-fighting substances - needed to fend off the disease and bypass the body's own process of developing them, which takes weeks after infection.  it is less clear which medicines are being used in the remap-cap trial, which is described as an 'adaptive' trial meaning the treatments used change over time.  britain's good news comes alongside a blow to global hopes of finding a cure after the world health organization announced it was suspending a trial of chloroquine.  the anti-malarial drug, which has caused a storm since us president donald trump revealed he is taking it regularly to try and protect himself, was one of the first to show promise.  but it is known to cause heart problems in large doses, and appears to be ineffective against covid-19 in small doses.  director of the who dr tedros adhanom gebreyesus announced the suspension yesterday after a study published in the lancet suggested covid-19 patients might be more likely to die if given the drug.  professor trudie lang, at the university of oxford, said: 'the who temporarily halting the use of chloroquine in covid-19 clinical trials highlights why we need to run carefully designed clinical trials during outbreaks.  'this enables us to learn as quickly as possible about whether potential therapies can tackle the virus and are safe. properly designed and managed clinical trials are the only way we can see whether drugs might also cause harm. they are designed to assess the safety of the drug relative to the ability to bring any benefit.'"
health,"advertisement  britain today announced 134 more victims of the coronavirus, taking the country's total death toll to 37,048.  the department of health also confirmed that 2,004 more people have tested positive for the disease, meaning 265,227 have received a diagnosis since the outbreak began in february.  today marks the first day since march that no coronavirus deaths have been announced in northern ireland. it had recorded one on monday and one on sunday, but the last time the figure was zero was march 23 - pre-lockdown.  it comes after separate data today revealed fewer people died of coronavirus during the week between may 9 and may 15 in england and wales than at any point over the past seven weeks.  figures collated by the office for national statistics show the overall covid-19 death toll in that week was 2,639 across the two nations, a drop of 1,235 from the week before. and the count is a fall of more than half from the peak of the outbreak - 8,180 people died from the coronavirus during the worst week, from april 11 to 17.  experts today raised concern, however, about the number of people who have died in their own homes during the pandemic, noting that there appeared to have been around 1,700 deaths that were not caused by coronavirus and not among people who would have otherwise been expected to die in hospital.  'we have seen a massive increase in deaths at home,' said professor david spiegelhalter, a statistician at the university of cambridge. he added that there appear to have been 'about the same number of covid deaths and deaths that appear to be unexplained'. the number emerged on top of deaths that were just relocated from hospitals, where non-coronavirus deaths have declined.  dr jason oke, a statistician at oxford university, said that the number of people dying of coronavirus appears to have been falling at a rate of 26 per day since the outbreak's peak in april. now that numbers were particularly low - fewer than 200 per day - he said there appeared to be a 'slight slowing of the trend'.  professor spiegelhalter also added that statistics continue to show a stark difference in how different age groups are affected by the virus. he said one in every 62 over-90s across england and wales had now died because of the virus, while there was 'not a serious increase at all' in the likelihood of death for people under the age of 45.  back-dated data from death certificates now show that more than 46,000 people had been killed by the virus by may 15, 36 per cent more than the official toll given by the department of health (33,998). if the same mathematical sum was applied to yesterday's dh count of 36,914, it would suggest the true death toll currently is around 49,000.  the government yesterday acknowledged a further 121 patients had died after testing positive for the coronavirus, marking the lowest monday death toll since lockdown on march 23 (74 fatalities).  health secretary matt hancock used today's downing street briefing to announce that the government has signed deals with more than 100 suppliers of personal protective equipment (ppe) and is planning to add billions of items to his ppe stockpile.  and he lauded the approval of ebola drug remdesivir for use on nhs patients with covid-19, which was announced today, calling it 'probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis begun.'  in other coronavirus developments in britain today:  government minister douglas ross resigned over dominic cummings' lockdown trip to durham, delivering a significant blow to boris johnson and downing street;  just one quarter of pupils in year 10 and 12 will be allowed to return to schools to see their teachers at any one time, according to department for education guidance;  boris johnson's popularity has plummeted in the wake of the cummings lockdown row with his approval rating going from 19 per cent to minus one;  portugal and britain are in talks to try and secure an air corridor for tourists that would allow british visitors to avoid a covid-19 quarantine upon returning home;  transport for london has urged the capital's businesses to continue to allow staff to work from home where possible despite travel restrictions being eased;  the uk has approved its first coronavirus medicine as health bosses granted the nhs emergency access to give severely-ill covid-19 patients the promising ebola drug remdesivir.  figures collated by the office for national statistics show the overall covid-19 death toll in the week that ended may 15 was 2,639 across the two nations, a drop of 1,235 from the week before. and the count is a fall of more than half from the peak of the outbreak - 8,180 people died from the coronavirus during the worst week, from april 11 to 17  figures collated by the office for national statistics show how the number of deaths in each setting spiked in april, during the peak of the covid-19 crisis  nhs england today announced 116 more covid-19 fatalities in hospitals only, while scotland and wales recorded 18 and eight deaths in all settings, respectively. health chiefs in northern ireland posted no new deaths.  the department of health's total (134) is lower than the combined number from the devolved nations (142) because authorities have different cut-off points for records to be submitted.  zero deaths recorded in northern ireland today no new cases of the coronavirus have been recorded in northern ireland today, for the first time since march. officials in northern ireland had recorded one death yesterday and one on sunday, but had not hit 0 since march 23, the day lockdown started in the uk. health minister robin swann said it was 'a clear sign of progress' but warned against complacency. however, the daily update did record a further 28 confirmed positive cases of the virus, bringing the total number in northern ireland to 4,637. the number of deaths is just a fraction of the potential 14,000 warned of by mr swann in march before strict social distancing rules were introduced to stem the spread of the virus. it comes just 24 hours after the republic of ireland reported no new covid-19 deaths on monday. mr swann told stormont's daily press conference: 'we all have been waiting for a day like this. 'i do believe it is a clear sign of the progress that has been made in the battle against coronavirus, however i have to emphasise a serious note of caution,' he said. 'there are no grounds whatsoever for complacency - that would be insult to all those who have sadly lost their lives and to all those who are mourning them. 'covid-19 is still infecting people in our community, sadly there will be more lives lost in the days and weeks ahead. 'however there is a clear downward trend in the rolling average number of cases and deaths that we are reporting.' source: press association advertisement  while the department stopped counting at 5pm yesterday, for example, scotland continues to record until later, meaning those will be added into tomorrow's uk round-up.  deaths may also be low today because of the compounded monday and bank holiday effects.  processes for recording people's deaths are known for slowing down and even stopping at the weekends and on bank holidays, meaning there is a dip every monday - or tuesday if it follows a bank holiday - followed by surges on tuesdays and wednesdays.  covid-19 deaths in care homes, which had become a focus after it emerged that the government had not offered enough support to the sector, also appear to be declining.  in the week ending may 15 the proportion of care home deaths caused by the virus in england and wales dropped to 37.2 per cent, and the proportion of covid-19 deaths happening in those homes fell to 30.6 per cent.  there are still thousands of people dying over the average, however. some 2,350 'excess deaths' were recorded in nursing homes in that week.  hospital deaths, by comparison, have continued to fade out. figures show there were 614 excess fatalities in nhs facilities across the two nations in the week ending may 15.  the data published by the ons is the most accurate way of counting how many people have died because of the coronavirus crisis in the uk.  it counts everybody who has covid-19, also known as the 'novel coronavirus', mentioned on their death certificate.  this includes people who were never tested for the virus because of the government's decision to ration tests.  the department of health, meanwhile, only counts the deaths of people who tested positive. this means it has missed off thousands of people who died in care homes and their own houses who weren't able to get tested.  as a result, the gap between the department's statistics and those published by the ons is a difference of around 36 per cent.  experts this morning raised concerns about the number of people who have died in private homes without any obvious explanation.  professor david spiegelhalter and oxford's professor carl heneghan said the number of people who have died at home was significantly higher than what they would normally expect to see.  how many people have died from covid-19 in england and wales since the crisis began? week ending may 15 may 8 may 1 april 24 april 17 april 10 april 3 march 27 march 20 total deaths 14,573 12,657 17,953 21,997 22,351 18,516 16,387 11,141 10,645 average 10,188 9,576 9,941 10,458 10,497 10,520 10,305 10,130 10,573  although they acknowledged that for many patients dying at home was preferable to doing so in hospital, they were worried that some of the deaths might have been people whose lives could have been prolonged with medical treatment.  professor spiegelhalter explained: 'over the seven weeks up to 15th may, as the nhs focussed on covid, around 8,800 fewer non-covid deaths than normal occurred in hospitals.  'these were not ""exported"" to care homes, since fairly few care-home residents normally die in hospitals.  'instead it appears that these contributed to the huge rise in deaths at home during this period, from the normal 16,300 to 28,600. only 1,800 of these 12,300 extra deaths were labelled as covid, leaving 10,500 excess non-covid deaths.  'if up to 8,800 of these deaths would normally have occurred in hospitals, this would leave at least 1,700 unexplained non-covid deaths at home.  'this also means that the 12,800 extra non-covid deaths in care homes are not explained by deaths moving from hospitals.'  professor spiegelhalter and professor heneghan called for urgent investigation into the numbers showing home deaths and said a 'huge immediate spike' had been evident 'as soon as the pandemic started' in early april, suggesting that hospitals' policy of turfing out as many patients as they could may have contributed.  government minister for scotland resigns over dominic cummings row a government minister today resigned over dominic cummings' lockdown trip to durham, delivering a massive blow to boris johnson and downing street. douglas ross, the parliamentary under secretary of state for scotland and a tory whip, announced this morning he is quitting the frontbench because he was unconvinced by mr cummings' defence of the 260-mile journey. mr ross, the mp for moray, said in his resignation letter: 'i have constituents who didn't get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn't visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. i cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.' a number 10 spokesman said boris johnson thanked mr ross, 37, for his 'service to government and regrets his decision to stand down' while labour said the mp had 'done the decent thing'. tory msp adam tomkins said the loss of mr ross was a 'disaster' and 'shows exactly why cummings should be sacked' as he predicted 'others will follow'.  the number of deaths involving coronavirus registered in the uk reached its lowest weekly level for six weeks, mirroring the drop in occurrences.  there were 4,210 deaths involving covid-19 registered in the week ending may 15, according to the most recent data from the ons - the lowest weekly total since the week ending april 3 (3,801).  the percentage of deaths involving covid-19 and the total number of excess deaths compared with the five-year average continued to decrease.  the total number of deaths from all causes rose by 1,916 to 14,573 - with an increase registered after a dip during the early may bank holiday. the ons said trends over the two weeks 'should be interpreted with caution'.  for the first time, deaths in care homes accounted for more than half of the total number of deaths with covid-19. on may 9 there were 214 deaths in care homes - 51 per cent of the total.  overall up to may 15, a third of all deaths involving coronavirus took place outside hospital - the majority in care homes.  the figures, released today by the ons, take the total number of deaths involving covid-19 in the uk to more than 46,000.  they show that 42,173 deaths involving covid-19 occurred in england and wales up to may 15 (and had been registered up to may 23).  the latest figures from the national records of scotland, published last week, showed 3,546 deaths involving covid-19 had been registered in scotland up to may 17.  uk has one of highest daily death rates per million in the pandemic britain is recording more coronavirus deaths per million people than almost any other country affected by the pandemic, data has revealed. analysis by the oxford university-led our world in data project shows that the uk recorded an average of 4.46 fatalities per million people in the population in the seven days leading up to may 26. only sweden and brazil had higher death rates, with 4.68 deaths per million and 4.49, respectively. data shows the uk has the highest rate of deaths per day per million people - graph shows seven-day average by comparison, the rate in spain was 3.37, in the us it was 3.4, in france 1.17, in italy 2.06, in andorra 3.7 and in belgium 2.86. britain has also recorded more deaths (37,000) than any other country in the world except the us (99,000). but experts have warned that drawing comparisons from this early, short-term data is 'simplistic' and overlooks differences in how deaths are recorded in each country and how accuracy varies widely.  and the latest figures from the northern ireland statistics and research agency, also published last week, showed 664 deaths involving covid-19 had been registered in northern ireland up to may 20.  together, these figures mean so far 46,383 deaths have been registered in the uk where covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.  a further 964 hospital patients in england who had tested positive for covid-19 died between may 16 and may 24, according to figures published on monday by nhs england.  the number of excess deaths in the uk since the coronavirus outbreak began is nearly 60,000. tuesday's ons figures show 53,960 excess deaths in england and wales between march 21 and may 15 2020.  the national records of scotland found there were 4,434 excess deaths in scotland between march 23 and may 17, while the northern ireland statistics and research agency put the figure for northern ireland at 867 excess deaths between march 21 and may 15.  in care homes, the number of covid-19-related deaths remained stable, with 1,660 taking place in the week ending may 15 in england and wales, compared with 1,666 in the previous seven days.  the proportion of deaths in care homes that involved coronavirus fell to 37 per cent, from 39 per cent the previous week.  the north west had the largest number of covid-19-related deaths for the second week running, and overtook london as the region with the highest proportion of deaths involving coronavirus.  almost a third - 31 per cent - of deaths registered in the north west that week mentioned coronavirus - the first time since the week ending march 13 that london has not had the highest proportion."
health,"on monday, the world health organization (who) announced it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its trial over safety concerns (file image)  a major british coronavirus trial of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is going ahead despite fears it might raise the risk of death, it emerged today.  oxford university researchers were given the green light by the uk drugs watchdog to continue giving the tablets to nhs patients with covid-19.  concerns about the donald trump-backed medicine were raised in a scientific paper published in the lancet last friday.  it linked the anti-malaria medicine with higher mortality and heart arrhythmias in severely ill coronavirus patients.  the finding prompted the world health organization (who) to pull the plug on its own global study of hydroxychloroquine, known as the solidarity trial, on monday.  the uk's medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) said it 'did not see any safety concerns' with the recovery trial, which is investigating the effect of five promising treatments on covid patients with moderate to severe illness, including hydroxychloroquine.  more than 10,500 covid nhs patients are taking part in the randomised evaluation of cov-id19 therapy (recovery) trial at hundreds of hospitals around the uk.  last friday, the lancet study looked at more than 96,000 people hospitalised with covid-19 and found patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher risk of death and heart rhythm problems than those who were not given the medicines.  however, the antimalarial was only given to patients who had fallen severely unwell with covid and were already at a high risk of falling victim to the illness.  the recovery trial has been deemed safe because the drug is being randomly allocated to patients with varying degrees of illness and compared against a control group.  but two other oxford-led human trials of the drug have been halted amid the safety concerns.  on sunday, president donald trump said he had finished taking his two-week prescription of the anti-malaria medication, which he'd used as a prophylactic to stave off the virus  who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus (pictured) said the decision came after a study on friday revealed higher mortality rates among covid-19 patients who took the drug  one of recovery's chief investigators, peter horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at oxford, said: 'since recovery (trial) patients are randomised, our data are much less vulnerable to the biases that plague studies that use routine health care data.  'an independent committee has looked at our data and did not see any safety concerns.  'we discussed our findings with (the) medicines and healthcare products regulatory authority (mhra), who have agreed with our interpretation that the data provide reassurance that continued enrolment into the hydroxychloroquine arm is safe and that we should press ahead with getting a reliable answer on hydroxychloroquine through the recovery trial.'  however, the mhra has temporarily suspended recruitment for the copcov trial, a separate oxford study being carried out alongside brighton university.  hydroxychloroquine: what you should know about the drug hydroxychloroquine was approved in the 1940s as a way to treat malaria. it is also prescribed for patients with arthritis and lupus. trump has hailed the 'game-changing' drug and said: 'this would be a gift from heaven, this would be a gift from god if it works.' physicians, however, have urged that the medication shouldn't be used without more testing. the us food and drug administration (fda) has also warned doctors against prescribing the drug to treat coronavirus outside of hospitals following reports of serious side effects, including irregular heart rhythms and death among patients. preliminary results from a recent study done on coronavirus patients at us veterans hospitals showed no benefit, casting more doubt on the drug's efficacy during the pandemic. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has removed guidance from its website informing doctors on how to prescribe hydroxychloroquine. initially, the cdc webpage had read: 'although optimal dosing and duration of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of covid-19 are unknown, some us clinicians have reported anecdotally.' it now says: 'there are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the us fda to prevent or treat covid-19.' advertisement  copcov is an international study investigating whether the malaria tablets can prevent coronavirus infection in the first place.  hydroxychloroquine will be given to more than 40,000 frontline healthcare workers from europe, africa, asia and south america.  the oxford researchers believe their research is safe because it does not involve patients already ill with coronavirus. they remain confident their study will go ahead.  but the university said it had temporarily paused enrollment around the globe and would wait on the mhra's decision.  the mhra has also temporarily blocked recruitment for the principle trial, which is looking at hydroxychloroquine's effect on elderly covid patients - who are most at risk of dying from the disease.  the principle trial is studying people aged 50 to 64 who have covid-19 symptoms and a chronic health condition such as heart disease, asthma or cancer.  it is unclear how many patients are taking part.  commenting on the announcement, professor trudie lang, director of the global health network, nuffield department of medicine, university of oxford, said: 'the who temporarily halting the use of chloroquine in covid-19 clinical trials highlights why we need to run carefully-designed clinical trials during outbreaks.  'this enables us to learn as quickly as possible about whether potential therapies can tackle the virus and are safe.  'properly designed and managed clinical trials are the only way we can see whether drugs might also cause harm. they are designed to assess the safety of the drug relative to the ability to bring any benefit.  'we have long known that chloroquine can cause harmful cardiac-related side effects from the use of chloroquine in the treatment of malaria.  'recent trials carried out in china of a lower chloroquine dose didn't show efficacy in relation to covid-19. a higher chloroquine dose could bring increased risk of harmful side effects.'  she added that using chloroquine 'off licence' or outside a trial does not help answer questions about its safety and can also present a risk to the patient.  dr stephen griffin, associate professor in the school of medicine, university of leeds, said: 'the who has taken the wise precaution of halting arms of their wide-ranging therapeutics trial relating to chloroquine (cq) and hydroxychloroquine (hcq).  'this is largely based upon a study published last week that retrospectively analysed thousands of patients receiving these drugs as part of their covid-19 treatment, either alone or in combination with antibiotics.  'the study could find no evidence for a beneficial effect in patients taking these drugs.  'however, worryingly, patients appeared to be at heightened risk of cardiac complications, especially when taking cq or hcq alongside macrolide antibiotics.'  president trump was among the first to wax lyrical about the possible benefits of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus patients in march.  then last week he revealed he'd been taking the malaria drug for a week-and-a-half to stave off the virus.  in an interview with full measure with sharyl attkisson that aired on sunday, trump announced he'd finished taking his prescription.  'finished, just finished,' the commander-in-chief said. 'and by the way, i'm still here. to the best of my knowledge, here i am.'  trump suggested he began taking the drug after two white house workers tested positive for the virus.  'i believe in it enough that i took a program because i had two people in the white house that tested positive,' he said. 'i figured maybe it's a good thing to take a program.'"
health,"when fono mcfarland-seumanu began her reign, her country was soon plunged into a deadly outbreak of measles which killed 83 samoans  when the reigning miss samoa beauty queen was crowned in the pacific paradise island, she might have expected a year of celebrations and glamour.  but when fono mcfarland-seumanu began her reign, her country was soon plunged into a deadly outbreak of measles which killed 83 samoans – mostly babies – and struck almost 6,000 people in a tiny population of 200,000.  samoa was put into lockdown in order to carry out a mass immunisation programme. and as a specialist public health nurse, fono volunteered to take part in the vaccinations.  the dark-haired beauty went from home to home to deliver the vital jabs, while emergency medical teams from all over the world – including the uk – helped staff in the overwhelmed hospitals.  and after the state of emergency ended, fono - full name fonoifafo - carried on that work to make sure all the children who needed vaccinating were covered in a catch-up campaign, going out twice a week to rural villages.  now she's fighting to keep residents safe from covid-19, promoting staying at home and social distancing on her social media – and says the country's measles outbreak helped the global response to coronavirus.  samoa, home to around 200,000 people, is one of only a handful of nations to avoid having any confirmed coronavirus cases. it is in lockdown again to fight coronavirus, after enforcing the draconian measures for two days in december to carry out a mass-vaccination drive to protect thousands from measles.  fono, 24, said: 'i think the whole world has learned from this measles epidemic here in samoa from what we've gone through. that's evident in the way that everyone has responded to the coronavirus.'  the measles crisis shook up healthcare in samoa and caused the government to take a hard look at its public health system.  the dark-haired beauty went from home to home to deliver the vital jabs, while emergency medical teams from all over the world – including the uk – helped staff in the overwhelmed hospitals (pictured holding a baby while they are vaccinated)  fono is pictured with the baby she held while they were vaccinated and the nurse, koreti  how has samoa reacted to covid-19? in january, samoan health officials introduced a quarantine site at faleolo hospital next to the country's only international airport. by mid-february anyone travelling via china or hong kong was not admitted into samoa unless they had quarantined for two weeks at their last port of call. some passengers were turned back on arrival. this list of countries was extended as the virus spread. in march the country went into a state of emergency and banned gatherings of more than five people and later all international travel. advertisement  take naseri, the director general of health at the ministry of health, told mailonline: 'after an [measles] outbreak that killed 90 we are not taking the coronavirus threat lightly.'  commentators says it was the vital jolt to strengthen the system which has led to some of the earliest stringent travel restrictions to prevent the virus entering the island.  in january they introduced a quarantine site at faleolo hospital next to the country's only international airport.  by mid-february anyone travelling via china or hong kong was not admitted into samoa unless they had quarantined for two weeks at their last port of call. some passengers were turned back on arrival. this list of countries was extended as the virus spread.  in march the country went into a state of emergency and banned gatherings of more than five people and later all international travel.  nicola hawley assistant professor of epidemiology at yale school of public health, said samoa's almost 'accidental preparedness' after the measles outbreak came at huge cost to the nation.  samoa, home to around 200,000 people, is one of only a handful of nations to avoid having any confirmed coronavirus cases. it is in lockdown again to fight coronavirus, after enforcing the draconian measures for two days in december to carry out a mass-vaccination drive to protect thousands from measles  fono is now fighting to keep residents in samoa safe from covid-19 by promoting staying at home and social distancing messages on her social media  samoa was put into lockdown in order to carry out a mass immunisation programme in december. and as a specialist public health nurse, fono volunteered to take part in the vaccinations. she is pictured outside a house with baby jerome elisapea  how many people died in samoa's measles outbreak? samoa - home to around 200,000 people - was rocked by an outbreak of measles last year, with the first cases occurring at the end of september. the united nations (un) blamed anti-vaxxers for the crisis, which killed 83 samoans – mostly babies – and struck almost 6,000 people. only a third of the 200,000 residents on the island had received both their mmr jabs before the outbreak began to spiral out of control. authorities on the pacific island made the unprecedented decision to shut the nation down for two days back in december. people were told to stay indoors amid the epidemic, with emergency workers going door-to-door to give all unvaccinated residents the mmr jab. families were asked to hang red flags from their homes to signal they have not been vaccinated. shops, schools and roads were all closed.  but she added: 'few nations have such recent experience with a crisis like this.  'as they continue to recover from the heartache of the measles outbreak and face this new uncertainty, samoa should know that in some circles their health leaders have almost as many fans as their national rugby team.'  fono had already been speaking out about why kids should get the mmr jab to samoans in radio interviews and social media after a measles outbreak in new zealand in 2019, where she worked as a nurse.  she had been born and brought up there by her samoan parents, her father lemmy a pastor, her mother nancy a mental health worker.  she said: 'i was urging parents to get their children vaccinated because the numbers were going to continue to rise if we [didn't] take action.'  once she won the miss samoa title in september 2019 she moved to samoa from new zealand and went on to win miss pacific islands in november in papua new guinea, the global regional title where fiji, tonga, the cook islands and others battle it out.  when she landed back in samoa – when the government appealed for international medical teams to help – she learned that they were short of vaccinators.  fono posted a cartoon mock-up of her wearing a face mask with the caption: 'keep clean and stay safe'  fono told her facebook followers: 'we must all remain at home and not engage in activities with friends and families that are not part of your isolation bubble'  how have other nations in oceania fared in the covid-19 pandemic? nation australia new zealand french polynesia fiji new caledonia papua new guinea solomon islands vanuatu guam cases 7,118 1,504 60 18 18 8 0 0 0 nation australia new zealand french polynesia fiji new caledonia papua new guinea solomon islands vanuatu guam deaths 102 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  she said: 'we had a lot of people who were volunteering their time to help with the vaccination programs, but we didn't have enough nurses to actually vaccinate. luckily, i was certified to be able to vaccinate.'  she also redoubled her health messages, making videos and more posts on twitter, facebook and instagram.  when she went out doing house to house emergency vaccinations during the measles lockdown in december in samoa, she caused a stir.  fono said: 'every single family that we'd stopped to was excited i guess, to see that the miss pacific islands was at their doorstep.  'at the time, i didn't think of myself as miss pacific islands. i was solely just another team player that was there to help vaccinate.'  sadly, she was approached by some of the families whose babies had died.  she said: 'after people lost babies to measles, some of the families reached out and said, ""this is what the miss samoa girl was talking about on the radio station"". and no one had really absorbed those messages at the time.'  in other ways, her winning miss pacific islands cheered people up during a challenging time.  she said: 'a lot of the families had actually thanked me for bringing back positive news to our country at the time we were looking for something to celebrate.'  now fono, based at a samoan government building in apia, the capital, is helping spread the word about covid-19 on facebook and supporting national immunisation week.  families in samoa were asked to hang red flags from their homes to signal they had not been immunised as the nation shut down for two days in december for a mass-vaccination drive  the island's capital city of apia was turned to a ghost town with roads, schools and shops closed (pictured, a red flag hangs outside a cafe)  and she has asked locals to perform the samoan traditional dance siva on tiktok as a challenge to give them something to do, with the hashtag #passthesiva.  she said: 'it's a crazy and unprecedented time right now globally with the latest covid-19 pandemic. it's heart breaking to hear the rising death toll contributed to this virus.  'but it's reassuring to know that countries throughout the world are taking action to minimise the spread of this virus by implementing a lockdown or period of isolation.'  she is a passionate advocate of public health. fono added: 'with public health you're working on the prevention side of things. i've never really been a fan of a working in hospital because i feel like the people are coming to you when they're at the end stages.  'why would you wait until they get there, when you could be feeding them with the information they need that would stop them from getting there in the beginning?'  she said she sees how positive messages about vaccination can work, when she arrives to give a scheduled vaccination to one child. 'when we turn up to the house, the mom is bringing out five other children behind them.  'that slows our program down a bit, but it's good to see that they're now receiving the messages and that parents more comfortable asking questions and just supportive of the whole vaccination programmes.'  and she says she is so glad that she has a platform to get her messages across.  she said: 'this is my opportunity to really make noise around what's important.'  this report was supported by a journalism grant from the european journalism centre https://ejc.net/"
health,"advertisement  fewer people died of coronavirus during the week between may 9 and may 15 in england and wales than at any point over the past seven weeks, data today revealed.  figures collated by the office for national statistics show the overall covid-19 death toll in that week was 2,639 across the two nations, a drop of 1,235 from the week before. and the count is a fall of more than half from the peak of the outbreak - 8,180 people died from the coronavirus during the worst week, from april 11 to 17.  back-dated data from death certificates also show more than 46,000 people had been killed by the virus by may 15, 36 per cent more than the official toll given by the department of health (33,998). if the same mathematical sum was applied to yesterday's dh count of 36,914, it would suggest the true death toll currently is around the 49,000-mark.  the government yesterday acknowledged a further 121 patients had died after testing positive for the coronavirus, marking the lowest monday death toll since lockdown on march 23 (74 fatalities).  since the coronavirus lockdown began there have been 53,960 'excess deaths' in england and wales, meaning all of those people died on top of the number that would be expected in a normal year. separate data collected by the statistical bodies of scotland and northern ireland suggest britain's total number of excess deaths is around 60,000.  figures collated by the ons also revealed there has now been 11,650 covid-19 deaths in care homes and 26,817 in hospitals. but the crisis is continuing to burn in care homes, with the number of daily deaths occurring in nursing homes topping those in hospitals for the first time ever on may 9 (214 compared to 191).  figures collated by the office for national statistics show the overall covid-19 death toll in the week that ended may 15 was 2,639 across the two nations, a drop of 1,235 from the week before. and the count is a fall of more than half from the peak of the outbreak - 8,180 people died from the coronavirus during the worst week, from april 11 to 17  figures collated by the office for national statistics show how the number of deaths in each setting spiked in april, during the peak of the covid-19 crisis  how many people have died from covid-19 in england and wales since the crisis began? week ending may 15 may 8 may 1 april 24 april 17 april 10 april 3 march 27 march 20 total deaths 14,573 12,657 17,953 21,997 22,351 18,516 16,387 11,141 10,645 average 10,188 9,576 9,941 10,458 10,497 10,520 10,305 10,130 10,573 advertisement  covid-19 deaths in care homes, which had become a focus after it emerged that the government had not offered enough support to the sector, also appear to be declining.  in the week ending may 15 the proportion of care home deaths caused by the virus in england and wales dropped to 37.2 per cent, and the proportion of covid-19 deaths happening in those homes fell to 30.6 per cent.  there are still thousands of people dying over the average, however. some 2,350 'excess deaths' were recorded in nursing homes in that week.  hospital deaths, by comparison, have continued to fade out. figures show there were 614 excess fatalities in nhs facilities across the two nations in the week ending may 15.  the data published by the ons is the most accurate way of counting how many people have died because of the coronavirus crisis in the uk.  it counts everybody who has covid-19, also known as the 'novel coronavirus', mentioned on their death certificate.  this includes people who were never tested for the virus because of the government's decision to ration tests.  the department of health, meanwhile, only counts the deaths of people who tested positive. this means it has missed off thousands of people who died in care homes and their own houses who weren't able to get tested.  as a result, the gap between the department's statistics and those published by the ons is a difference of around 36 per cent.  government minister for scotland resigns over dominic cummings row a government minister today resigned over dominic cummings' lockdown trip to durham, delivering a massive blow to boris johnson and downing street. douglas ross, the parliamentary under secretary of state for scotland and a tory whip, announced this morning he is quitting the frontbench because he was unconvinced by mr cummings' defence of the 260-mile journey. mr ross, the mp for moray, said in his resignation letter: 'i have constituents who didn't get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn't visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. i cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.' the relatively unknown mp, who backed the uk staying in the eu in 2016, added that the vote leave maverick's interpretation of the government advice 'was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked'. a number 10 spokesman said boris johnson thanked mr ross, 37, for his 'service to government and regrets his decision to stand down' while labour said the mp had 'done the decent thing'. tory msp adam tomkins said the loss of mr ross was a 'disaster' and 'shows exactly why cummings should be sacked' as he predicted 'others will follow'. the resignation of mr ross, a qualified football referee who was previously best known for being criticised for missing a commons vote to run the line in a champions league game, comes at the worst possible time for mr johnson and mr cummings as the government tries to move on from the damaging row.  the number of deaths involving coronavirus registered in the uk reached its lowest weekly level for six weeks, mirroring the drop in occurrences.  there were 4,210 deaths involving covid-19 registered in the week ending may 15, according to the most recent data from the ons - the lowest weekly total since the week ending april 3 (3,801).  the percentage of deaths involving covid-19 and the total number of excess deaths compared with the five-year average continued to decrease.  the total number of deaths from all causes rose by 1,916 to 14,573 - with an increase registered after a dip during the early may bank holiday.  the ons cautioned that the ve day bank holiday weekend could have contributed to the low death count two weeks ago and said the data should be interpreted with caution, but it follows a falling trend throughout may.  for the first time, deaths in care homes accounted for more than half of the total number of deaths with covid-19. on may 9 there were 214 deaths in care homes - 51 per cent of the total.  overall up to may 15, a third of all deaths involving coronavirus took place outside hospital - the majority in care homes.  the figures, released today by the ons, take the total number of deaths involving covid-19 in the uk to more than 46,000.  they show that 42,173 deaths involving covid-19 occurred in england and wales up to may 15 (and had been registered up to may 23).  the latest figures from the national records of scotland, published last week, showed 3,546 deaths involving covid-19 had been registered in scotland up to may 17.  and the latest figures from the northern ireland statistics and research agency, also published last week, showed 664 deaths involving covid-19 had been registered in northern ireland up to may 20.  together, these figures mean so far 46,383 deaths have been registered in the uk where covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.  a further 964 hospital patients in england who had tested positive for covid-19 died between may 16 and may 24, according to figures published on monday by nhs england.  the number of excess deaths in the uk since the coronavirus outbreak began is nearly 60,000. tuesday's ons figures show 53,960 excess deaths in england and wales between march 21 and may 15 2020.  the national records of scotland found there were 4,434 excess deaths in scotland between march 23 and may 17, while the northern ireland statistics and research agency put the figure for northern ireland at 867 excess deaths between march 21 and may 15.  in care homes, the number of covid-19-related deaths remained stable, with 1,660 taking place in the week ending may 15 in england and wales, compared with 1,666 in the previous seven days.  the proportion of deaths in care homes that involved coronavirus fell to 37 per cent, from 39 per cent the previous week.  the north west had the largest number of covid-19-related deaths for the second week running, and overtook london as the region with the highest proportion of deaths involving coronavirus.  almost a third - 31 per cent - of deaths registered in the north west that week mentioned coronavirus - the first time since the week ending march 13 that london has not had the highest proportion."
health,"for many people with conditions such as arthritis, ibuprofen has long been the medicine of choice.  it can be the deciding factor in patients being pain-free enough to walk, or not.  but arthritis patients are now putting industrial lubricant wd-40 on their stiff and aching joints because they fear, wrongly, that ibuprofen will make coronavirus symptoms worse, a leading pharmacist has warned.  ‘mixed messages’ about the safety of this painkilling and anti-inflammatory drug during the pandemic has led to others using aloe vera and ‘snake oil lotions and potions’ bought on the internet, says sid dajani, a pharmacist in hampshire and former treasurer of the royal pharmaceutical society.  for many people with conditions such as arthritis, ibuprofen has long been the medicine of choice (stock image)  despite the latest nhs advice stating the drug is safe to take, sales are at around a third of their normal levels, he adds.  concerns emerged on march 14, when french health minister olivier veran said ibuprofen could aggravate coronavirus infections.  his comments are thought to be partly based on remarks made by an infectious diseases doctor about four young covid-19 patients with no underlying health conditions who developed serious symptoms after taking ibuprofen, as well as a letter that had been published in the journal lancet respiratory medicine three days earlier.  ‘mixed messages’ about the safety of this painkilling and anti-inflammatory drug during the pandemic has led to others using aloe vera and ‘snake oil lotions and potions’ bought on the internet (stock image)  the letter, from researchers in switzerland, suggested ibuprofen makes it easier for the virus to get into the body’s cells and so could exacerbate infections.  in a clarification on march 16, the authors stressed they had merely been putting forward a ‘suspicion’.  but it was too late — worries about the ‘link’ were already rife and, on march 17, the nhs advised people with symptoms of covid-19 to avoid taking ibuprofen and use paracetamol instead.  in april, the advice changed again, after the commission on human medicines, which advises the uk government on the safety of drugs, reviewed the data on whether ibuprofen might increase the risk of an infection worsening.  try this ecohydra alcohol-free hand sanitiser is said to be certified by independent laboratories as effective against coronavirus. pack of three 50ml, £8.97, buyecohydra.com advertisement  it concluded there is insufficient evidence ibuprofen makes people more likely to catch covid-19 or worsen symptoms.  ibuprofen was back on the table, with those with coronavirus symptoms told to ‘take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel uncomfortable’.  despite this, some britons are still afraid to take the drug, says sid dajani.  ‘we still have lots of ibuprofen on our shelves, it’s not selling as well as it used to,’ he says.  ibuprofen is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like compounds involved in pain and inflammation.  the medication is widely used to ease the pain or swelling of everyday conditions such as headaches, toothache and sprains and strains.  it’s also relied on by many people with chronic conditions, with some getting it on prescription.  ‘we’ve had loads of patients on nsaids for arthritis coming in saying they don’t want to take them any more,’ says sid dajani.  arthritis patients are now putting industrial lubricant wd-40 (pictured) on their stiff and aching joints because they fear, wrongly, that ibuprofen will make coronavirus symptoms worse, a leading pharmacist has warned  ‘some were even using wd-40 on their joints as they’d heard that’s quite good, others were relying on aloe vera. some were looking on the internet and getting all sorts of snake oil lotions and potions.’  he adds that it was upsetting to see patients in pain or resorting to unproven or dangerous remedies when ibuprofen could help them.  ‘some had been on nsaid medication for four or five years and doing well and are suffering now because they don’t want to take it. [it’s] a tragedy,’ he adds.  the thinking behind the use of wd-40 is that it will ease stiff joints, in much the same way as it loosens stiff locks.  but using wd-40 for arthritis ‘is bonkers’, said a versus arthritis charity spokesman. the charity urges people taking ibuprofen not to stop without checking first with their gp or specialist.  dr taher mahmud, a consultant rheumatologist at the london osteoporosis clinic, called it ‘very sad and concerning’ that patients are resorting to home remedies such as wd-40.  ‘failure to replace nsaids with other proven therapies can have a huge impact on patients’ lives,’ adds dr mahmud. ‘they can be in severe pain and so stiff they are unable to wash and dress themselves, or be left bed-bound.’  the experience with ibuprofen highlights concerns that the speed at which the pandemic is evolving means evidence about what does and doesn’t work is not always being rigorously examined.  there is particular concern that pre-prints, early drafts of medical and scientific papers that have not been peer-reviewed — the lengthy process of being vetted for omissions and flaws by other academics in the field — are being given undue weight during the pandemic.  hugh pennington, an emeritus bacteriology professor at the university of aberdeen, says: ‘there’s a mass of science coming out every day and some of it is conflicting.  ‘sometimes it is just too early to say. we are still at a very early stage of investigating coronavirus and it is very difficult to give clear, straightforward answers that will stand the test of time.’"
health,"a person infected with coronavirus can pass it on just by talking to someone in a closed environment such as a tube train or small office, simulations reveal.  in a simulation of tube travel, produced by software firm msc, one infected person can be seen literally coating other passengers with covid-19 - just by talking.  researchers found that someone chatting to a friend on the tube can 'coat others' with the deadly coronavirus - even if they don't sneeze or cough.  the new model looking at ways droplets from breath spread in enclosed spaces comes as britain prepares to return to work, school and a level of normality after lockdown.  public transport has become busier as people return to work and children prepare to return to school. researchers say talking without a mask can spread the virus  dr julian tang, an expert in respiratory conditions, from the university of leicester, told bbc news that droplets produced by talking don't travel as far as they do from a sneeze or a cough - which can travel up to 22ft - but researchers say it is still dangerous enough to pass on the virus.  'but they can travel far enough to affect your friend sitting opposite you, or someone who's chatting to you,' he said.  'when you're talking to a colleague you don't touch them, you don't spit on them, most of the interaction is by voice and breathing.'  in the case of coronavirus, which can be passed on through surface transmission, this causes a bigger problem for london underground travellers - as the droplets from conversations won't just sit on other passengers - but also on seats, buttons and handles.  msc software, who created the tube simulation, says wearing a mask is essential for slowing the spread of the deadly virus.  they found many droplets are expelled from the mouth and nose within a minute of someone talking and they proceed to coat others nearby.  this can be mitigated by wearing a face mask, which blocks the majority of front facing droplets as people talk, breathe and even cough or sneeze, say researchers.  according to the open university, the fact the virus can spread and remain on surfaces for several days is a major cause for concern.  it said that in office kitchens, as an example, simply washing the dishes after someone with the virus has used a cup, could lead to infection.  a recent study by canadian researchers found that even a simple cloth mask can block up to 99 per cent of infectious particles, adding to evidence for the use of masks in public.  researchers and government officials say washing hands, not touching faces and practising safe distancing from others are vital parts of returning to work.  many schools, offices and shops are demanding face masks, hand washing, implementing distance markers and doing regular deep cleans.  while keeping our distance is the most important factor, researchers say limiting time around someone infected can also reduce the risk of spreading the virus.  researchers found that someone chatting to a friend on the tube can 'coat others' with the deadly coronavirus - even if they don't sneeze or cough but wearing a mask helps  the world health organization says if you can't remain 6ft apart, you should limit time spent with colleagues in an enclosed space to 15 minutes.  a study by the university of oregon, into the spread of the virus in cafes and restaurants, found ventilation plays a major role.  they found that if someone with covid-19 coughs while sitting at a corner table the 6ft rule goes out the window as the virus droplets can spread even further.  smaller droplets are caught in a current of air coming from air conditioning units and spread around the room - a similar thing could happen in schools and offices.  researchers say it doesn't prove the virus can be transmitted in that way or make anyone ill if it did - just that the droplets of breath can be blown across the room.  in the case of coronavirus, which can be passed on through surface transmission, this causes a bigger problem for tube travellers - as the droplets from conversations won't just sit on other passengers - but also on seats, buttons and handles  do face masks make a difference and what should you wear if you can't get one? americans are increasingly being spotted wearing face masks in public amid the coronavirus pandemic, as are people are around the globe. soon, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) may advise all americans to cover their faces when they leave the house, the washington post reported. the agency is weighing that recommendation after initially telling americans that they didn't need to wear masks and that anything other than a high-grade n95 medical mask would do little to prevent infection any way. face masks do help prevent infection - but they're not all created equal research on how well various types of masks and face coverings varies but, recently, and in light of the pandemic of covid-19, experts are increasingly leaning toward the notion that something is better than nothing. a university of oxford study published on march 30 concluded that surgical masks are just as effective at preventing respiratory infections as n95 masks for doctors, nurses and other health care workers. it's too early for their to be reliable data on how well they prevent infection with covid-19, but the study found the thinner, cheaper masks do work in flu outbreaks. the difference between surgical or face masks and n95 masks lies in the size of particles that can - and more importantly, can't - get though the materials. n95 respirators are made of thick, tightly woven and molded material that fits tightly over the face and can stop 95 percent of all airborne particles, while surgical masks are thinner, fit more loosely, and more porous. this makes surgical masks much more comfortable to breathe and work in, but less effective at stopping small particles from entering your mouth and nose. droplets of saliva and mucous from coughs and sneezes are very small, and viral particles themselves are particularly tiny - in fact, they're about 20-times smaller than bacteria. for this reason, a jama study published this month still contended that people without symptoms should not wear surgical masks, because there is not proof the gear will protect them from infection - although they may keep people who are coughing and sneezing from infecting others. but the oxford analysis of past studies - which has not yet been peer reviewed - found that surgical masks were worth wearing and didn't provide statistically less protection than n95 for health care workers around flu patients. however, any face mask is only as good as other health and hygiene practices. experts universally agree that there's simply no replacement for thorough, frequent hand-washing for preventing disease transmission. some think the masks may also help to 'train' people not to touch their faces, while others argue that the unfamiliar garment will just make people do it more, actually raising infection risks. if the cdc does instruct americans to wear masks, it could create a second issue: hospitals already face shortages of masks and other ppe. what to use to cover your face if you don't have a mask so the agency may recommend regular citizens use alternatives like cloth masks or bandanas. 'homemade masks theoretically could offer some protection if the materials and fit were optimized, but this is uncertain,' dr jeffrey duchin, a seattle health official told the washington post. a 2013 study found that next to a surgical mask, a vacuum cleaner bag provided the best material for a homemade mask. after a vacuum bag, kitchen towels were fairly protective, but uncomfortable. masks made of t-shirts were very tolerable, but only worked a third as well as surgical mask. the cambridge university researchers concluded that homemade masks should only be used 'as a last resort.' but as the pandemic has spread to more than 164,000 people worldwide, it might be time to consider last resort options. advertisement  it's only the smaller breath droplets being spread in this fashion - or spreading further than 6ft - so it may not be a large enough dose to lead to infection.  kevin van den wymelenberg from the oregon team said the virus 'can be spread further than people might realise'.  'it's really impossible to completely eliminate risk,' van den wymelenberg told the bbc, 'but what we showed was a concept for how you could reduce transmission.'  'the good news is that there are things you can do to make safer spaces.'  he said bringing in fresh air through windows was better than air conditioning.  dr tang said something as simple as close conversations in an office could pass on the virus, regardless of air conditioning or airflow from outside.  'if you can smell your friend's breath - the garlic or curry or alcohol - you're inhaling what they're breathing out,' he told the bbc.  'and if you're inhaling enough of that air to smell it, then you're close enough to inhale any virus that's also carried in the air with it.'"
health,"cloth masks can prevent the spread of covid-19 by blocking up to 99 per cent of infectious particles, according to scientists who analysed a century of mask studies.  canadian researchers report that cloth masks, particularly those with several layers of cotton, block viruses carried via microscopic particles in the air.  cloth layers reduce infectious particles, emitted by the wearer through coughs and sneezes, from travelling through the air and settling on surfaces, they say.  although no direct evidence indicates cloth masks reduce transmission of the virus itself, 'convincing' evidence suggests they reduce contamination of air and surfaces.  an employee works on sewing the 2 tissue layers (cotton and polyester) of the face masks on april 30, 2020 in annecy, france  some combinations of cloth, such as cotton-flannel, block more than 90 per cent of particles, they report, while a three-layer mask can reduced airborne transmission of microorganisms and surface contamination by up to 99 per cent.  while the researchers don't guarantee cotton masks will prevent the wearer from becoming infected by sars-cov-2, the coronavirus that causes covid-19, the new report helps clarify their efficiency when it comes to blocking infectious particles.  the centers for disease control and prevention, the us public health institute, advocates the use of cloth masks in a public space, although there is no substitute for clinically-approved masks in a hospital.  'direct evidence about whether wearing a mask of any sort outside a health-care setting reduces actual transmission of covid-19 is lacking,' said first author catherine clase, associate professor of medicine at mcmaster university in canada.  'this is why public-health decisions about public mask wearing have been difficult to make, and why they differ around the world.  'our review suggests that cloth can block particles, even aerosol-sized particles, and this supports canadian public health policy on the issue.'  a worker tries on a boiler suit and face mask made at a garment factory in russia last month  people with lung conditions should not wear face masks people who have asthma or other lung conditions should not wear a face mask if it makes it difficult for them to breathe, experts say. those with asthma or illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) or cystic fibrosis may have to avoid masks or face coverings. masks can make it more difficult to draw air into the lungs, trigger asthma for some patients and cause anxiety, therefore changing breathing patterns. people should wear a mask if they comfortably can, to protect themselves and others around them, but not risk their own health in the process. the uk government has also said: 'face coverings should not be used by children under the age of 2 or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly.' advertisement  while cloth does not stop the virus itself, it does block particles generated by speaking, eating, coughing, and sneezing, which carry the virus.  cloth blocks droplets – more than five micrometres in diameter – and aerosols – a suspension of liquid particles, each less than five micrometres in diameter.  this means a virus-laden particle emitted by an infected mask wearer is kept within the mask, and can't hang in the air or settle onto a surface.  the research team examined a century of evidence on masks, and found strong evidence showing that cloth-based objects and cloth masks can reduce contamination of air and surfaces.  most of these studies looked at filtration efficiency, which is the ability of a material to block transmission, expressed as a percentage.  the team said masks are not assessed separately for every pathogen, and filtration efficiency depends on particles of different sizes, regardless of which pathogen the particle contains.  in 1962, researchers found that a mask made of three layers – muslin-flannel-muslin – reduced surface contamination by 99 per cent, total airborne microorganisms by 99 percent and bacteria recovered from the smaller particles and aerosols by 88 per cent to 99 per cent.  woman making homemade face mask with a sewing machine in her home while in quarantine. evidence shows that cloth masks, particularly those with several layers of cotton cloth, block droplet and aerosol contamination of the environment  tailor yalcine of boulard retouche prepares face protective masks in cotton sewn in his shop at the daguerre district in paris  another experiment in 1975 compared four medical masks and one commercially-produced reusable mask made out of four layers of cotton muslin.  the mask was shown to reduce all particles by 99 per cent, compared with 96 per cent to 99 per cent for contemporary disposable medical masks.  even for the smaller aerosols, the cloth mask was comparable with the medical masks of the day, the researchers said.  because the filtration of cloth varies, cotton from common items of clothing, such as layers of scarf, sweatshirt and t-shirt, may only have a filtration efficiency between 10 to 40 per cent, another study from 2010 suggests.  however, 2013 experiments showed just one layer of tea towel had a 72 per cent efficiency and one layer of t-shirt fabric 51 per cent.  and more recently, a 2020 study claims some fabrics block 'clinically useful' percentages of transmission, even for aerosols and even in single layers, although multiple layers improve their efficiency.  however, there can be one risky drawback from wearing multiple layers of cloth over one's face.  cotton protective face masks on display in a vending machine with a slogan reading 'masks here' at a subway station in berlin  'in terms of making masks, it is important to realise that more layers will give more protection, both inward and outward, but will make it harder to breathe,' said dr clase.  'for this reason, it is not recommended that children under two and people with breathing difficulties wear masks.'  while previous studies have potential to block viral particles, dr clase and her team stress that they homemade masks shouldn't be a substitute for medically certified personal protective equipment.  'we recognise the potential for unintended consequences, such as use of formal personal protective equipment by the general public, incorrect use of cloth masks, or reduced hand hygiene because of a false sense of security,' they write in annals of internal medicine.  'these can be mitigated by controlling the distribution of personal protective equipment, clear messaging, public education, and social pressure.'  advocating that the public make and wear cloth masks also 'shifts the cost of a public health intervention from society to the individual'.  'in low-resource areas and for persons living in poverty, this is unacceptable.'"
health,"cheltenham festival and liverpool's champions league match against atletico madrid led to more coronavirus deaths and suffering, a top scientist has claimed.  professor tim spector, who is leading the uk's biggest covid-tracking project, said the march sporting events 'caused increased suffering and death'.  data gathered from millions of volunteers found coronavirus 'hotspots' shortly after the events, the bbc reports.  data has shown a cluster of covid-19 patients needing hospitalisation in the area surrounding cheltenham racecourse which attracted 250,000 people through the turnstiles of prestbury park during the four-day festival which took place between march 10-13  gloucestershire hospitals nhs trust has recorded 187 deaths from the coronavirus so far, in bristol there have been 115 fatalities, followed by swindon (111) and bath (60)  professor tim spector (pictured on good morning britain on may 11) said the march sporting events 'caused increased suffering and death'.  cheltenham festival was 'like the last days of the roman empire' journalist melanie finn, who attended the horse-racing festival, told the bbc that basic safety rules were ignored at cheltenham. she said: 'it was like the last days of the roman empire, and i think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open, by god they were going to party.' ms finn, who flew from dublin, added: 'we had already cancelled the st patrick's day celebrations, and that in itself was huge for us. 'people were in shock. no-one could believe that was happening. that was an indicator of how serious the irish government was.' ms finn revealed that she asked her employer to fly her home during the festival because she was concerned about the potential spread of covid-19. she told the bbc that she developed symptoms of the coronavirus just a week after cheltenham - the average incubation period is around five days. advertisement  professor spector says the case rates 'increased several-fold' locally but number 10 said many factors could be behind the rises.  sporting events on the continent had, in some cases, already been called off or held behind closed doors without spectators.  but the uk was continuing to hold mass gatherings, with boris johnson saying at the time that people should 'as far as possible, go about business as usual'.  both england and scotland had a full schedule of football in the first week of march.  five horse racing meetings and the six nations rugby match at twickenham between england and wales - which the prime minister attended - had also taken place.  twenty-four hours before cheltenham opened up to 250,000 spectators, culture secretary oliver dowden said: 'there's no reason for people not to attend such events or to cancel them at this stage.'  professor spector, who works at king's college london, said that 'people will have probably died prematurely' because of the decision.  journalist melanie finn remembers how people ignored basic safety rules at cheltenham, saying: 'it was like the last days of the roman empire, and i think there was a little bit of a sense that if it was open, by god they were going to party.'  liverpool supporter joel rookwood has been ill for eight weeks and thinks he caught it at the match against atletico madrid.

'it didn't make any sense that 3,000 atletico fans could travel to anfield at that time,' martinez-almedia told spanish radio station onda cero.  cheltenham organisers have previously insisted the event 'went ahead under the government's ongoing guidance throughout,' pointing out other sports continued in britain at the time.  thousands of people attended the festival in gloucestershire, pictured above on march 13  fans of atletico cheer prior to the uefa champions league round of 16, second leg soccer match between liverpool fc and atletico madrid in liverpool on march 11  'it's simply not possible to know how and where someone who has tested positive for covid-19 has contracted it,' said dr sue smith, the festival's senior racecourse medical officer.

health,"every week the alarming truth about the covid-19 coronavirus is becoming clearer. some of us are much more likely to die from it than others, and the key reasons are just beginning to be unravelled by scientists.  for most fit and healthy people, the risk is small to non-existent; but for others, the possibility of dying once infected is frightening. while there have been just two deaths among children aged under 15 in the uk, there have been more than 30,000 in those aged over 60.  we now know that being overweight, with its associated problems of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, substantially increases the danger of not surviving the infection — thought to be as a result of a weakened immune system.  if you combine this with the additional risk of age-related decline in the immune system, the danger is even greater.  every week the alarming truth about the covid-19 coronavirus is becoming clearer (stock image)  but now it seems there is another sinister element to the story which might explain why deaths in men outnumber those in women by two to one, why overweight people are badly affected, why some minority ethnic groups may be at higher risk of complications and possibly why smokers seem to be protected from catching the infection (and why they fare badly if they do get it).  evidence is emerging of the role of a cell receptor called ace2, which covid-19 attaches to in order to infect our healthy cells. it’s thought that the more of these receptors you have, the more entry points there are for the virus.  the ace2 receptor was found to be the main entry point for the potentially lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) virus, of which this new coronavirus is the latest version. the receptors are found on cells in the nose lining, the lungs, pancreas, kidneys and gut, and in the lining of blood vessels, in the heart muscle and circulating on cells in the blood.  the variety of locations could help explain why those people with covid-19 have suffered such a wide range of different symptoms, from loss of a sense of taste and smell to stomach problems such as diarrhoea and post-infection heart problems.  the normal role of the ace2 receptor is in blood pressure control. it sits on our cells and is activated by a chemical messenger in our blood: if blood pressure is high, the receptor causes blood vessels to dilate.  evidence is emerging of the role of a cell receptor called ace2, which covid-19 attaches to in order to infect our healthy cells (stock image)  it works alongside another blood pressure regulatory compound simply called ace (this is not a receptor but an enzyme) which causes blood vessels to constrict. together, ace2 and ace keep blood pressure levels regulated. it’s this system that ace inhibitors — drugs for high blood pressure and heart failure taken by 15 per cent of all adults in britain — are designed to target, blocking the enzyme and preventing blood pressure rising.  obesity means more ‘entry points’  the covid-19 coronavirus is designed to fasten itself on to ace2 receptors like a key opening a lock. it then gets into the cell and re-programs it to make multiple copies of the virus.  it then destroys these exhausted cells and billions of copies of the virus are released, which then infect other cells around the body.  this process causes a clog-up of dead and decaying cells and an associated immune reaction (which leads to the symptoms of the disease). for those with high levels of ace2 receptors, there are many more entry points for the virus, so more chance of severe disease and worse outcomes.  now studies have highlighted groups who have more ace2 receptors, and those who have fewer. an investigation published last week in the journal of the american medical association, by doctors at mount sinai hospital in new york, showed four-year-old children had fewer ace2 receptors in their noses than older adults.  and it seems people with high blood pressure and heart disease produce more of these receptors as their bodies struggle to cope with a malfunctioning system. an international study published this month in the european heart journal looked at ace2 receptor levels in 1,485 men and 537 women with heart failure — a major cause of high blood pressure. in men, ace2 receptors were circulating in higher volumes in cells found in their blood and even in the testes.  we now know that being overweight, with its associated problems of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, substantially increases the danger of not surviving the infection (stock image)  another study, published last week in the journal obesity, found that overweight people with the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), which is linked to damage caused by smoking, ‘have more of the receptor or entry points required for coronavirus infection in their lungs’, said the lead author dr andrew higham, a researcher in the division of infection, immunity and respiratory medicine at the university of manchester. ‘this means these patients may be at a greater risk of developing covid-19 due to increased opportunities for infection.’ there are 1.2 million britons with copd. it is clear that fat cells, too, produce more ace2 receptors. ‘the more fat you have, the more ace2 receptors you’ve got,’ says professor sanjay sharma, a cardiologist at st george’s university hospitals nhs trust in south london and a spokesman for the european society of cardiology.  ‘obesity is a chronic inflammatory state,’ he says, ‘and if you have a low-grade inflammatory situation and a compromised respiratory system already [because of the pressure your weight puts on your lungs and diaphragm], and you’re attacked by a virus, you have a problem.  ‘plus, most of these people have high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, which are also linked to high rates of ace2 receptors. these are some of the factors that help explain why obese people have done worse and may be a partial explanation of why we have had more deaths than other countries because our burden of obesity is higher.’  but losing weight can cut numbers  losing weight reduces the amount of fat tissue in the body and the number of ace2 receptors, explains professor sharma: ‘it is an argument for curbing obesity because i suspect we will see many more viral pandemics like this.’  but dr david gaze, a lecturer in clinical biochemistry at the university of westminster, says the picture is more complicated than the number of receptors. their location appears to matter, too.  some studies looking at sars in mice have shown that ace2 receptors had done their job and caused blood vessels to dilate, reducing the level of injury to lungs. but another study in mice had shown the opposite effect. ‘it seems there is a difference in ace2 receptor conditions according to whether the receptors are found in the soluble form — i.e. in the blood — or the “bound” receptor form in organs,’ he told good health.  ‘the covid-19 virus is relatively novel for the human population. we didn’t previously know the ace2 receptor was required for getting the virus into cells. there may be different global distributions of ace2 receptors between different populations and ethnicities, but we don’t know.’  losing weight reduces the amount of fat tissue in the body and the number of ace2 receptors, explains professor sharma (stock image)  of the nearly 37,000 deaths in britain so far attributed to covid-19, more than a third have been among black, asian and minority ethnic groups (bame), even though they make up only 14.5 per cent of the population.  university of hawaii scientists are studying whether people from some ethnicities have more ace2 receptors.  the british heart foundation has pointed out that south asians tend to have a higher risk of heart disease, while those from an african and afro-caribbean heritage tend to have a greater risk of high blood pressure problems and stroke, as well as type 2 diabetes.  professor sharma suggests a greater tendency to develop these problems may lie partly with ethnic minority communities being more likely to have been reared on traditional, healthy wholefoods, and their metabolic systems being ill-equipped for an assault by the high-sugar, heavily-processed diet that is commonplace in the uk.  ‘people of asian origin tend to develop heart disease at a lower bmi obesity stage,’ he says. ‘in places such as india, their diets have started to include foods such as mcdonald’s and kfc, and the prevalence of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes is shooting up.’  however, it’s too early to know if levels of ace2 receptors play a role in the higher mortality rate of britons from bame backgrounds, says simon clarke, a virologist at the university of reading.  good news (and bad) for smokers  another twist in the story is the potential role of ace2 receptors in protecting smokers from catching covid-19.  a study of 1,000 covid-19 patients in china published in the new england journal of medicine in march, revealed that only 12.6 per cent of them were smokers, although 28 per cent of the population smoke.  a similar study in france of 11,000 covid-19 patients found only 8.5 per cent were smokers, while smokers make up to 25.4 per cent of the population.  professor florence tubach, head of public health at the pitié-salpêtrière hospital in paris, carried out further studies and said that covid-19-infected smokers were five times less likely to develop symptoms than non-smokers and four times less likely to be hospitalised. trials are planned to see if nicotine patches can prevent covid-19 infection.  although smokers have higher levels of ace2 receptors, the theory is that nicotine binds to them, preventing coronavirus from using them to enter cells and thus protecting smokers from coronavirus infection.  but other research has shown that, once in hospital, covid-19-infected smokers are less likely to survive. some doctors have pointed out that because cigarettes are immediately removed as soon as a patient enters hospital, any potential nicotine benefit is lost.  news of the investigation prompted a rush to buy nicotine patches and gum, which led paris authorities to restrict sales earlier this month.  but co-researcher professor bertrand dautzenberg warned that nicotine patches for non-smokers are not a good idea. ‘a smoker can easily tolerate a nicotine dose a hundred times higher than the dose that would make someone who has never smoked feel constantly sick,’ he told le figaro newspaper.  and it must be emphasised that most experts believe that the lethal effects of smoking would outweigh any possible benefit from nicotine, although research may find that nicotine patches alone could be beneficial.  link to serious complications  other rarer complications caused by the virus locking on to ace2 receptors include strokes.  doctors at university college hospital in london have reported a series of six unexplained strokes linked to covid-19 infection, suggesting that when ace2 receptors are blocked in the blood vessels, abnormal clotting occurs.  ‘some covid patients are waking up from a ventilator and not remembering anything, which suggests there might be mini blood clots in the brain, says professor sharma.  ‘there is no doubt there’s a difference in people’s reactions to covid-19 and we still don’t know enough about it.’"
health,"having a faulty gene linked to dementia may double the risk of becoming severely-ill with the coronavirus, a study has claimed.  experts found carriers of the apoe e4 gene were more likely to have a severe case of covid-19, than those with a more common variant.  the same faulty gene is already known to increase the risk of developing alzheimer's disease in old age by up to 14-fold.  scientists studied the dna of almost 40,000 britons aged between 48 and 60 years old to make the link.  almost one in five people who have died with covid-19 in the uk also had dementia, the most common form of alzheimer's.  one explanation for people with dementia being more vulnerable to covid-19 could be because the virus spread rapidly in care homes.  but the research, published in the journal of gerontology: medical sciences, could help to explain the high death rates being seen in people with dementia.  having a faulty gene linked to dementia doubles the risk of severe covid-19, a study has found  almost one fifth of covid-19 victims in hospitals had dementia, according to official figures from nhs england  the study was a joint endeavour by a team of academics at the university of exeter medical school and the university of connecticut.  it used data from the uk biobank - a study of 500,000 volunteers set up in 2006 for researchers to track the health of participants over time.  experts analysed only 382,188 participants who had european ancestries, therefore their findings can only be applied to that group, with an average age of 68.  they looked at a gene called apoe, of which there are three variants. in this analysis, 69 per cent had two copies of the e3 variant, the most common genotype.  some 28 per cent had one copy of the e4 variant, and three per cent had two copies of the e4 variant, known as the 'e4e4' genotype.  the e4 variant is a major risk gene for alzheimer’s – people with one copy have up to a four-fold increased risk and people with two copies have up to a 14-fold risk, compared to those without.  why does dementia increase the risk of covid-19? the people most at risk of developing severe symptoms if they catch coronavirus are people over the age of 70. the majority of people living with dementia are over 70 years old, which immediately puts them at greater risk. studies are being carried out into how the immune system is involved with dementia. some suggest that the immune system is not functioning properly. it is known already that the immune system is weaker in older people, including in the lungs. many people with dementia will struggle to understand what is happening because the part of their brain that forms new memories is impaired. therefore they may forget to wash their hands more regularly as the government advises or keep socially distanced. there has been an increase in deaths of people in the uk that were not directly caused by covid-19. this could be for a number of reasons, such as being unable to access healthcare. for people with dementia, the new isolation rules and many other changes in their life - such as a lack of certain foods in supermarkets - can be particularly distressing and may influence their disease progression. their behaviour may also change as a result of stress. source: homecare.co.uk advertisement  the researchers gathered data for who had a positive test for covid-19 during a period when testing was mostly restricted to hospital patients. therefore a positive result was a marker of severe covid-19 infection.  having the e4e4 genotype raised the risk of severe covid-19 2.3-fold compared to e3e3, the findings showed. having just one copy of the e4 variant raised the risk by 14 per cent.  the prevalence of e4e4 in the group that had severe covid-19 was disproportionately high.  although less than three per cent of the participants had the e4e4 genotype, six per cent of the 622 people with severe covid-19 had the e4e4 genotype, while 64 per cent had e3e3.  it suggested people with dementia who have died of covid-19 may have died as a result of their genetics putting them more at risk - not because dementia makes them more vulnerable, the team said.  first author of the paper dr chia-ling kuo said: 'this is an exciting result because we might now be able to pinpoint how this faulty gene causes vulnerability to covid-19. this could lead to new ideas for treatments.  'it's also important because it shows again that increasing disease risks that appear inevitable with ageing might actually be due to specific biological differences, which could help us understand why some people stay active to age 100 and beyond, while others become disabled and die in their sixties.'  the team has previously found that people with dementia are three times more likely to get severe covid-19.  professor david melzer, who led the team, said: 'several studies have now shown that people with dementia are at high risk of developing severe covid-19.  'this study suggests this high risk may not simply be due to the effects of dementia, advancing age or frailty, or exposure to the virus in care homes.  'the effect could be partly due to this underlying genetic change, which puts them at risk for both covid-19 and dementia.'  it's difficult to unravel exactly why a person with dementia is more likely to develop covid-19 because there are so many influencing factors.  scientists were cautious to draw conclusions from the findings because they cannot rule out that dementia itself caused the covid-19, and not the genetics.  dr chia-ling kuo removed people from the sample who had a dementia diagnosis so they could focus solely on genetics with the help of gp records from 2017.  they found the risk of covid-19 remained in those with the e4e4 gene. explain this clearer  but experts warned it wasn't possible to completely emit those people from the data, and the disease could have developed in the past three years.  professor david curtis, a geneticist at university college london, said: 'the concern i have about this study is that the results could potentially be explained by the possibility that more subjects with two copies of the high risk apoe e4 allele might have had dementia than those who had none.  'the study authors try to exclude this possibility by removing subjects who had dementia at the time of recruitment to uk biobank or recorded on a hospital discharge diagnosis but, perhaps unsurprisingly, very few people meet these criteria.  'i'm afraid this study does not really convince me that the apoe e4 allele is really an independent risk factor for severe covid-19 infection. i would want to see this tested in a sample where dementia could be more confidently excluded, perhaps a younger cohort.'  having the e4e4 genotype raised the risk of testing positive for the virus 2.3-fold compared to e3e3, the findings show. three per cent of participants had the e4e4 gene (9,022). but the prevalence of e4e4 in the group that had tested positive for sars-cov-2, the virus which causes covid-19, was disproportionately high. six per cent of the 622 people who had a positive test result for the coronavirus had e4e4 (37)  the team tried to remove people from their sample who had a dementia diagnosis so they could focus solely on genetics. they found the risk of covid-19 remained in those with the e4e4 gene (2.39)  dr carol routledge, director of research at alzheimer’s research uk, said: 'despite the large study group, only 37 people with the risk gene tested positive for covid-19, and we must be careful about the conclusions we draw from such small numbers.'  despite reservations about the early research, professor tara spires-jones, uk dementia research institute group leader, was impressed with the study.  she said: 'this study is robustly conducted, and the observation is important and will lead to future research into how apoe4 may influence the risk of contracting covid-19 or having severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation, where most tests are performed.  'this is interesting because recent research into why apoe4 also increases the risk of alzheimer's disease indicate that apoe4 is involved in the immune system.'  the workings of the immune system have implications for how the body fights the coronavirus, and can be altered by a number of conditions such as obesity, diabetes and possibly dementia.  dr fiona carragher, the alzheimer's society, said more research must uncover why those with dementia have been so badly hit by the coronavirus.  'dementia is the most common pre-existing condition, accounting for a quarter of deaths so far, and tragically there's an additional huge unexplained rise in deaths recorded to dementia alone,' she said, referencing the high number of excess deaths in care homes that were not directly as a result of covid-19.  'people with dementia and their families are desperately worried. the government needs to take urgent action putting people with dementia at the heart of a clear plan to protect those at risk.'"
health,"eating foods like burgers and pies for lunch can ruin your attention span in the afternoon, scientists say.  volunteers who tucked into treats high in saturated fat saw an almost immediate slump in working memory.  but when they ate healthy unsaturated fats – found in avocados and fish – their concentration levels were maintained.  previous studies have found regularly eating junk can affect attention.  eating foods like burgers and pies for lunch can ruin your attention span in the afternoon  but this is believed to be the first showing just one unhealthy snack has an instant impact on brain function.  scientists from ohio state university in the us said it is possible harmful fatty acids from junk food get into the bloodstream and cross the brain barrier, damaging mental performance.  they recruited 51 middle-aged women and got them to eat fatty treats, such as burger and chips, before completing a continuous performance test involving clicking on on-screen images.  the women later repeated the experiment, this time having eaten a healthy salad lunch made with sunflower oil.  when people ate a healthy snack rather than junk food they retained their full attention span  the results revealed brain function declined within a couple of hours of eating junk food.  but they retained their full attention span after the healthy choice.  in a report on the findings, researchers said previous studies found cognitive abilities suffer after at least five days of unhealthy eating.  they added: 'but our research shows a single meal high in saturated fat can impede attention.  'these findings suggest just one fatty lunch can potentially diminish productivity in the workplace.'"
health,"none of the mutations of the novel coronavirus appear to increase its ability to spread from person-to-person, a new study suggests.  researchers found that, among 31 strains that circulated independently in cities or counties, no strain had a higher risk of transmission compared to the other.  findings showed that some of the most common mutations are neutral, and some were even mildly harmful to the virus.  in fact, some of the most common mutations seem to have been caused by our immune system rather than the virus adapting to better infect human hosts, according to the team from university college london (ucl) in the uk.  a new study from university college london looked at 31 mutations of the coronavirus (pictured) that have spread independently at least 10 times in various cities and countries  no strain had a higher risk of transmitting from person-to-person compared to another one. pictured: a nurse stands with a covid-19 patient during a zoom video call in an icu at stamford hospital in connecticut, april 24  'as a growing number of mutations have been documented, scientists are rapidly trying to find out if any of them could make the virus more infectious or deadly, as it's vital to understand such changes as early as possible,' said lead author dr francois balloux, director of the ucl genetics institute.  'we employed a novel technique to determine whether viruses with the new mutation are actually transmitted at a higher rate, and found that none of the candidate mutations appear to be benefiting the virus.'  there are three ways the family of coronaviruses, including the new virus, mutate.  one way is by mistake when the virus is replicating itself, another by interacting with another virus that has infected the same cell and the third by a person's own immune system.  so far, nearly 7,000 mutations of the virus, known as sars-cov-2 have been identified by global researchers.  of that number, nearly 300 have shown evidence of the ability to occur repeatedly and independently in cities and countries.  for the study, published in pre-peer review site biorxiv.org, the team looked at viral of virus genomes from more than 15,000 covid-19 patients in 75 countries  they focused on 31 mutations that circulated at least 10 times on their own as the pandemic has continued to rage on.  researchers created a model of the virus's evolutionary tree to see if a particular mutation was becoming more and more common.  the majority of mutations are neutral, but there are a few that either harm or help the virus spread to new hosts and pass on to 'descendant viruses.'  most mutations are neutral, while others are advantageous or detrimental to the virus. both neutral and advantageous mutations can become more common as they get passed down to descendant viruses.  there was no evidence that any of the common mutations increased the virus's ability to spread and, in fact, most were neutral or 'hurt' the virus.  'it is only to be expected that a virus will mutate and eventually diverge into different lineages as it becomes more common in human populations,' said first author dr lucy van dorp, a senior research fellow at ucl's genetics institute.  'but this does not necessarily imply that any lineages will emerge that are more transmissible or harmful.'  worldwide, more than 5.4 million people have been infected and more than 344,000 people have died.  in the us, there are more than 1.6 confirmed cases of the virus and more than 97,000 deaths."
health,"human trials for a coronavirus vaccine will begin in australia today with 130 volunteers trialing a new drug.  the testing will mark the first human trial of a covid-19 vaccine in the southern hemisphere and will take place at melbourne's alfred hospital.  the nvx-cov2373 vaccine was developed by american biotech company novavax and will be tested on healthy volunteers aged 18 to 59.  human trials for a coronavirus vaccine (pictured) developed by us biotech company novavax will take place with 130 volunteers at melbourne's alfred hospital on tuesday  the nvx-cov2373 vaccine (pictured) will be tested on volunteers aged 18 to 59  coronavirus cases in australia: 7,221 new south wales: 3,104 victoria: 1,663 queensland: 1,059 western australia: 591 south australia: 440 tasmania: 228 australian capital territory: 107 northern territory: 29 total cases: 7,221 recovered: 6,625 deaths: 102 advertisement  the vaccine stimulates high levels of neutralising antibodies and is aimed at enhancing the body's immune response.  clinical research organisation nucleus network will run the early stages of testing and expand the trial to clinics in brisbane within a week.  infectious diseases expert dr paul griffin from brisbane's mater health services is one of the researchers overseeing the phase one clinical trials, which are the first step in human testing.  'it is very exciting,' he told nine's today show on tuesday.  'healthy volunteers will receive this vaccine for the first time and it's predominantly about safety. so we will carefully monitor them throughout.'  apart from safety, the trials will give researchers initial clues about the effectiveness of the vaccine developed by novavax.  novavax expects to have some results to share in july and that could pave the way for phase two trials to look at the impact on people with coronavirus and side effects.  'we are, in parallel, making doses - making vaccines - in anticipation that we'll be able to show it's working and be able to start deploying it by the end of this year,' novavax research head dr gregory glenn told a virtual press conference in melbourne from novavax' headquarters in maryland.  the novavax trial involves a 'recombinant' vaccine created by using genetic engineering to grow harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein in giant vats of insect cells in a laboratory.  scientists extract and purify the protein and package it into virus-sized nanoparticles.  'so it is something almost the same as the surface of the virus but doesn't contain any live virus,' dr griffin said.  'we hope that will then give these volunteers and people that receive this vaccine an immune response that will then protect them from this infection.'  it's the same process novavax used to create a nanoparticle flu vaccine that recently passed late-stage testing.  'potentially, by the end of the year, there will be a significant number of doses available,' dr griffin said.  about a dozen experimental vaccines are in the early stages of testing, or due to start, in china, the us and europe.  preliminary results from the human trial of the vaccine in australia are expected in july."
health,"britain has the worst death toll for covid-19 in europe and the second highest in the world — or does it?  the latest figures, read out at the government press briefing on monday afternoon, show 36,914 covid deaths in the uk. only the united states, which has a population five times the size of the uk’s 67.9 million, has more.  in contrast, germany, which has a bigger population than the uk, has reported just over 8,000 deaths, and ireland, our nearest neighbour, has had only 1,608.  it’s easy for us to assume that the figures reflect how well — or how badly — individual governments have handled the pandemic.  however, experts say that while some countries, including the uk, have clearly done worse than others in terms of deaths, it is too early to choose between them because the daily death tolls don’t tell the whole story.  ‘this is not eurovision — it’s pretty pointless to try to rank them,’ says sir david spiegelhalter, a statistician and a professor of the public understanding of risk at the university of cambridge.  ‘just looking at the raw number of deaths is not a great way to compare what’s going on,’ adds jason oke, a statistician at the university of oxford.  partly, this is because when we compare different countries’ death tolls, we are not comparing like with like but, to put it simply, apples with pears.  britain has the worst death toll for covid-19 in europe and the second highest in the world — or does it?  one of the clearest reasons is that countries are not counting deaths in the same way. some, such as the uk, are including only people who have tested positive for the virus. others, such as belgium, also include suspected cases, which will increase their total.  ‘we also need to consider how the size of a country’s population, the density of its population (that is, how tightly packed together its citizens are) and how old they are affect its death toll,’ says dr oke. densely populated cities such as london and new york are likely to be worse hit than remote parts of ireland or norway.  then there is the fact that different countries are at different stages of dealing with the virus, meaning the data isn’t complete. some countries that appear to be doing well may suffer resurgences when they come out of lockdown; or, if they’re in the southern hemisphere, things may get worse when winter sets in in the next few months. others that have a high death toll now could fare better during any second wave of the disease.  ‘it’s almost like deciding the final score when you’re only halfway through a football game,’ says dr oke. ‘who knows what is going to happen in the second half? it’s anybody’s call.’  he believes we need to wait for six months before we have the full picture. then, we can use statistical techniques to draw more accurate comparisons.  one technique (already used with flu) involves looking at ‘excess deaths’ — the number of extra deaths over a set period of time compared to the same period in previous years.  another technique, which is common when compiling international data on cancer, takes into account the size and age of each country’s population.  ‘while neither method is perfect, they would allow for more accurate international comparisons than the raw figures we have now,’ says dr oke.  in the meantime, here we take a look at the numbers we do have and the stories behind the statistics of some of the countries ‘apparently’ faring better or worse than others.  united kingdom  population density helped spread  united kingdom: population density helped spread  deaths: 36,914  population: 67.9 million  deaths per million: 544  average age: 40.5 years  people per square mile: 727  how deaths are counted: deaths in hospitals, care homes and in the community of people who have tested positive for covid-19 are included in the daily updates. (a second set of figures is released weekly by the office for national statistics and uses data from death certificates and so includes suspected cases — ones in which testing hasn’t been done but it is thought that the virus played a part.)  behind the figures: on may 5, the uk’s death toll overtook italy’s to become the highest in europe and the second worst in the world. but while it’s easy to think of things that britain could have done to better control the pandemic, population density may have pushed up the death toll, says hannah fry, an associate professor in the mathematics of cities at university college london.  covid-19 thrives on close contact — and with 727 people per square mile, the uk is four times as crowded as ireland, which reported a death rate more than 20 times lower than the uk.  it also has a higher proportion of people living in towns and cities than most other european countries. london is one of europe’s biggest cities and has a population of nine million — more than twice that of berlin.  ‘it’s safe to say the number of people visiting a supermarket or pressing the buttons on the lift in a block of flats will make a difference,’ says hannah fry.  the uk also has one of the highest levels of obesity in western europe, and a recent study by the university of liverpool of covid patients in hospital found those who were obese were almost 40 per cent less likely to survive than their slimmer counterparts.  research also shows that three-quarters of the covid-19 patients in intensive care in the uk are overweight or obese.  ‘coronavirus is not something that affects everyone equally — existing health conditions matter too,’ adds hannah fry.  ireland  ireland: younger population kept death rate low  younger population kept death rate low  deaths: 1,608  population: 4.9 million  deaths per million: 328  average age: 38.2 years  people per square mile: 186  how deaths are counted: deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community, including those suspected to have had covid-19 but not confirmed with tests.  behind the figures: ireland’s relatively young population may have given it an advantage. the disease is particularly dangerous for the elderly and a recent analysis found that pensioners are 34 times more likely to die of the disease than working age britons.  at 38.2 years, the average age in ireland is almost a decade lower than in italy and two years younger than the uk. with age the most important factor when it comes to surviving covid-19, ireland’s comparatively youthful population could be having a big effect on its death toll, says dr oke. ‘if the age structure of england and wales’s population looked like ireland’s, i suspect the number of deaths would be reduced by thousands.’  united states  united states: there are a lot more people to infect  there are a lot more people to infect  deaths: 97,049  population: 331 million  deaths per million: 293  average age: 38.3 years  people per square mile: 94  how deaths are counted: deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community, including those suspected of having had coronavirus but not tested.  behind the figures: the united states has more deaths than any other country but it also has a huge population. if we look at deaths per million people instead, it isn’t the worst in the world any more. indeed, the rate of 293 deaths per million is almost a third of the rate for belgium, which has the most deaths per capita of any country.  another way of looking at the u.s. death toll is to compare it with the combined figure for the five largest countries in western europe. the uk, germany, france, italy and spain have a joint population that’s similar to the u.s. but their combined death toll is nearly 50 per cent higher.  factoring population size is ‘such a simple thing’ yet easily overlooked, says dr oke.  ‘if you take into account population size, then the u.s. is doing better than most of europe.’  belgium: includes a broad range of symptoms  belgium  includes a broad range of symptoms  deaths: 9,312  population: 11.6 million  average age: 41.9 years  deaths per million: 803  people per square mile: 991  how deaths are counted: deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community, including those of people suspected to have had covid-19 but not been tested.  behind the figures: belgium, a small country with a population of 11 million, has recorded more deaths from coronavirus than china, where the virus is thought to have originated.  while there are questions over how far the chinese figures can be trusted, belgium’s death toll of 9,312 is the highest per capita in the world.  unlike many other countries, it also includes suspected deaths in its tally and says that this ‘very complete way of counting’ has helped it track the virus’s spread and quickly intervene in hotspots of disease.  ‘if you want to compare our numbers with a lot of other countries, you basically have to cut them in half,’ says steven van gucht, head virologist at the national institute for public health in belgium.  belgium may also be using a broader definition of coronavirus symptoms than other countries that include suspected cases, pushing its total even higher, says dr oke.  indeed, its definition of a suspected case includes symptoms as diverse as diarrhoea, a runny nose, chest pain and falls.  ‘in belgium, they are erring on the side that any time they remotely suspect that covid-19 was involved, they’ll include it in the official stats,’ adds hannah fry. ‘this is why it is unfair to look at the number of deaths alone.’  italy  italy: bigger families may be playing a part  bigger families may be playing a part  deaths: 32,785  population: 60.5 million  deaths per million: 542  average age: 47.3 years  people per square mile: 533  how deaths are counted: most of the daily total is made up of deaths in hospital of people who have tested positive for covid-19. data on other deaths, including those in care homes, is patchy.  behind the figures: the figure of 32,785 is the second highest in europe but may be an undercount.  like many other countries, italy records only the deaths of people who have tested positive for the virus. however, ‘there has not been massive screening in care homes, so we do not know the exact number of covid-19 cases and related deaths there’, says eleonora perobelli, a researcher in long-term care and government policy at sda bocconi school of management in milan.  we also know that with an average age of 47.3 years, the italian population is one of the most elderly in the world, putting it at higher risk of severe covid-19.  its emphasis on family life, including multi-generational households in which older people live under the same roof as their children and grandchildren, is also thought to have fuelled the spread of the virus simply because it is harder to keep the generations apart than if they were living in separate homes.  ‘multi-generational households, by virtue of having younger people going in and out, would expose older people more than if they lived on their own,’ says dr oke.  germany  germany: an undoubted success so far, but will it last?  an undoubted success so far, but will it last?  deaths: 8,247  population: 83.8 million  deaths per million: 98  average age: 45.7 years  people per square mile: 623  how deaths are counted: deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community of people who have tested positive for coronavirus. suspected cases can be tested after death.  behind the figures: with 8,247 deaths in a population of almost 84 million, germany’s per capita death toll is less than an eighth of that of neighbouring belgium and a fifth of the uk’s.  like italy, germany also has a relatively older population.  however, many of its initial cases of covid-19 were in fit, young people who were thought to have brought the disease back from skiing holidays in italy, before passing it on to people who were of a similar age and, therefore, more likely to recover.  even today, only around 20 per cent of germany’s cases are in the over-70s.  dr oke says that while it is widely agreed that germany — which has done vast amounts of testing — is a success story when it comes to controlling the coronavirus, the unpredictable nature of pandemics makes it too early to claim victory.  ‘who knows if, in three months’ time, their count will be closer to ours,’ he adds. ‘you might call it now and be lucky — but it’s a waiting game.’  how to know if your symptoms are covid  by dr nick summerton  working as a gp for the covid clinical assessment service, set up to manage patients who need to speak to a doctor after calling nhs 111, i chat to at least five patients an hour over the phone.  based on what i am told, my advice will vary from calling an ambulance to suggesting they get tested, or stay at home and monitor themselves closely.  but symptoms are tricky blighters. they continually change and the same symptoms can be caused by different problems.  the number of symptoms being recommended to identify those with covid-19 is growing: the list now includes, as well as a dry cough and a raised temperature (which is where we started), changes in a person’s sense of taste or smell, extreme tiredness, breathlessness, loss of appetite, sore throat, diarrhoea, muscle pain and headache.  perhaps the best way to spot people with covid-19 is to think about symptoms in three broad groups: general viral symptoms, symptoms linked to the virus as it enters our bodies, and symptoms from organs that it might infect.  i have found that covid-19 is more likely if an individual has at least four new symptoms from two or more of these groups.  general viral symptoms: (occasional or continuous) fever or raised temperature, chills with or without shaking, loss of appetite, fatigue or extreme tiredness, muscle/joint pains, headache, dizziness.  entry symptoms: alterations of smell or taste, soreness in the throat, sore eyes, nasal congestion or runny nose.  organ-specific symptoms: lungs: dry cough, mild to moderate breathlessness, heaviness on the chest. guts: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea.  dr summerton has been a gp for 32 years and has written books focusing on diagnosis."
health,"when for two months the only reasons we’ve been allowed out of the house are to shop for essentials and for exercise, more and more people have taken up running, cycling and home workouts to keep fit during lockdown — and some for the very first time.  while there are those who are consuming 2,331 extra ‘lockdown calories’ a week, according to a new study (with experts calling our weight gain the ‘corona stone’), and alcohol sales were up 22 per cent in march, others are using the enforced isolation as an opportunity to emerge fitter than before — with a timely boost to their body’s ability to fight off infections.  ‘exercise is especially important during lockdown because people, particularly those at high risk, are far less active generally,’ says professor janet lord, an expert in immunity and ageing at the university of birmingham.  ‘among those at higher risk of coronavirus are people who are obese or have raised blood pressure, and making time for more physical activity will help both these groups,’ she adds. ‘being more socially isolated is bad for mental health, too, and physical activity can improve mood.’  when for two months the only reasons we’ve been allowed out of the house are to shop for essentials and for exercise, more and more people have taken up running, cycling and home workouts to keep fit during lockdown (stock image)  regular exercise could also boost your immunity. ‘using muscles during exercise has an anti-inflammatory effect and helps immune cells called neutrophils get to an infection site quicker,’ says professor lord.  it encourages the body to make immune cells called macrophages — ‘guard’ cells that patrol the body for signs of attack — so we are better able to control infection.  ‘any exercise that gets your heart rate up seems to be able to “turn back the clock” of the immune system. you need to move as much as possible, even if it’s only getting up and down a few times in an armchair every hour — every bit helps,’ says professor lord.  an increasing number are taking advantage of the extra time and, thanks to the lockdown, could emerge with their health transformed. here, four people share their inspiring stories.  time to protect my heart  abby fisher, 38, works in administration and lives in bristol with her son freddie, five.  abby fisher, 38, works in administration and lives in bristol with her son freddie, five  before: 20 mins home exercise three times a week.  after: 90 mins daily workouts.  she says: i discovered i had inherited cardiomyopathy [a disease of the heart muscle] eight years ago, after my mother died from an unexpected heart attack linked to the condition.  a test showed the blood vessels leading to and from my heart were thickened — which would raise my risk of heart attacks.  pregnancy put an extra strain on my heart and i had to have a device fitted in my chest to restart my heart if it stops.  but exercise wasn’t a priority. i would get about 20 minutes of gentle exercise a few times a week.  when covid-19 arrived in the uk, my cardiologist said he didn’t know how the virus would affect me, and warned me to be strict about isolating. he also said i should lose weight.  since then, i have dropped from 15 st 8 lb to 12st (i am 5ft 4in). i was a size 16/18 before lockdown but my size 14 clothes are too big.  this is thanks to a healthier diet and online exercise videos.  i have got into a routine of an hour of workouts each morning (including joining freddie for a joe wicks pe session), then a high-intensity 30-minute workout when freddie is in bed. as a result, i’m so much fitter — before lockdown i’d want to lie down after a gentle walk.  my cardiologist will be thrilled — he told me losing weight would benefit my health more than any pill they could give me.  ms fisher has got into a routine of an hour of workouts each morning, including joining her son freddie (pictured) for a joe wicks pe session  cycling to a slimmer

fiance, alistair, also 27, a chef.  before: no exercise.  after: cycling eight miles a day.  she says: i used to drive four miles to work, but i’ve started cycling for the first time thanks to the lockdown — my fitness levels are improving already.  before the lockdown i was beginning to get some concerns over my health as i had been completely inactive for a while and was beginning to find just going up and down the stairs a struggle.  i’ve not done much formal exercise before as i hate the idea of going to the gym and a tendon disorder in my foot means it hurts if i run or even if i walk for too long.  i’d been wanting to start gentle cycling for a while, but i was terrified of the busy roads. so when the roads started to clear as more people stayed home, it felt like the right time to begin.  i heard charities were offering access to bikes for key workers, which spurred me on. i was lucky to get an electric bike to borrow from a local church charity.  i was really nervous at first — i hadn’t ridden a bike for nearly five years — but it has been fantastic.  even though it has electric assistance, the power only kicks in when the wind is strong or you’re going up a steep hill, so you still have to pedal hard — the hilly journey to and from work is proving to be a good daily workout.  in the first week, my legs would be like jelly when i got off the bike. but i find the journey easy now.  i’m also sleeping better, i have more energy, and my stress levels have dropped. i’ve started to lose weight, too — 10 lb so far — and am eating more healthily. i am getting married next year so it’s another incentive.  i’ve started cycling with alistair at the weekends for fun — this is unheard of for me. this has changed my habits for good and i will carry on cycling to work when lockdown is lifted.  uphill runs to be healthy at 60  mark florman, 60, an investment banker, lives in gloucestershire with his wife, alexia, 55, an artist. they have three daughters  mark florman, 60, an investment banker, lives in gloucestershire with his wife, alexia, 55, an artist. they have three daughters.  before: gym once a week.  after: runs two miles uphill, twice a day.  he says: before lockdown, my job kept me active — i was always rushing in and out of meetings and jetting around the world. in fact, i rarely sat down so i never felt i needed to do any formal exercise.  but lockdown means i’m stuck at my desk at home for 12 hours a day, which is not healthy. one of my daughters is a doctor and warned me that as a man aged 60, i was at increased risk of complications if i got the virus. this spurred me on to do what i could to strengthen my immune system and body to fight any infection. in late march i contacted a trainer at my local gym — i found her on instagram (@bebefitnesscoach) — and asked her for an exercise plan.  because i live at the bottom of a steep hill, she picked an uphill running challenge; together we fixed a two-mile route — from the village green straight up to the church in stow-on-the-wold. it’s part-road, part-forest and very tough terrain!  my first attempt nearly killed me — i clocked a time of 18 minutes and had to phone my wife to pick me up in the car because i had nothing left in the tank to get home.  now i do it twice a day, and am doing it in 16 minutes. i’m getting fitter all the time.  i’ve found it’s a fantastic way to clear my head and escape the sense of isolation, as well as the benefits to my body.  online workouts to curb anxiety  gerry hurt, 49, a beauty therapist, lives on the isle of man with her two

lockdown has affected everyone’s lives, but after having to stop work temporarily, i found my anxiety levels shot through the roof. as well as money worries, i had a permanent dread of venturing outside for fear of the virus.  before lockdown, i had just recovered from scarlet fever, which had made me horribly ill with a painful throat, lethargy, a cough and a rash on my stomach. by the end of february, i was feeling strong enough to manage short walks. then, just at the point where i felt able — and keen — to try proper exercise, we went into lockdown.  and that’s when the anxiety took hold. i knew exercise would help but i had to find an indoor replacement as i simply couldn’t go outside.  i found personal trainer lucy wyndham-read on youtube. she creates routines for different fitness levels, and there is a facebook group where people who watch her videos interact too, which provides the social connection i need.  my anxiety levels drop after exercising because it releases feel-good chemicals. i am more flexible and fitter than before lockdown, too.u"
health,"black coronavirus patients in the us are being hospitalized much more often in comparison with other races, a new study suggests.  researchers, from the california-based healthcare system sutter health, found that african-americans were being admitted at nearly three times the rate of white and hispanic patients.  what's more, black patients were more than twice as likely to be transferred to intensive care units once hospitalized compared to white patients.  the team suggests that, despite having insurance, black covid-19 patients may not be tested or seek medical care until it is an emergency that requires hospitalization.  black coronavirus patients were admitted at 2.7 times the rate of white and hispanic patients. pictured: a nurse cleans a patient with covid-19 on a ventilator at the stamford hospital icu in stamford, connecticut, april 24  after being hospitalized, 24.6% of african americans were transferred to the icu compared to 10.7% of their white counterparts. pictured: a person is taken from a chicago fire department ambulance into the emergency room at roseland community hospital, april 21  for the study, published in health affairs, the team looked at more than 1,000 sutter health patients who tested positive from january 1 to april 8.  results showed that african americans are being hospitalized at 2.7 times the rate of white and hispanic patients.  the findings held true when adjusted for age, sex, household income and pre-existing conditions such as obesity and diabetes.  more than 52 percent of african american patients with confirmed covid-19 cases were hospitalized compared to 25.7 percent of white patients.  additionally, 24.6 percent of blacks were transferred to the icu in comparison with 10.7 percent of their white counterparts.  researchers also found that black patients were less likely to be tested for the virus or go to the emergency room for care compared to white, hispanic or asian patients.  'the covid-19 pandemic has ripped a band-aid off of the structural inequities that exist within our society. we must address these disparities right away because the cost of not addressing them is measured in human life,' dr stephen lockhart, chief medical officer at sutter health, said in a statement.  'with lives on the line, we as a state can and should do better in connecting minority patients to culturally competent care.'  the researchers noted health coverage does not equate access and that the fact that africans americans are being hospitalized at higher rates means there are health disparities.  in california, african americans make up six percent of the state population, but make up more than 10 percent of covid-19 deaths for which race has been reported.  'the real value of the study lies not in the disparities it reveals but in its utility to inform our work to develop solutions that will address the equity gaps we are seeing with programs such as community outreach and engagement in at-risk neighborhoods,' said lead author kristen azar a nurse at sutter health.  'this pandemic underscores the need to develop innovative solutions that are specifically tailored to address the unmet needs of those at highest risk.'  the results from the new study mirror the patterns seen in other studies across the us and around the world.  last week, a study from the non-partisan apm research lab found that blacks in the us were dying at higher rates than white patients.  across the country, african americans have died at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people - two-and-a-half times the rate of white people at 20.7 per 100,000.  and earlier this month, a new analysis from the uk found that black and asian britons were two-and-a-half times more likely to die from coronavirus than white people.  in the us, there are more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 97,000 deaths."
health,"live coronavirus was detected in the stool of patients who have died from the illness, suggesting the virus may be spreading via the fecal-oral route, a new study suggests.  most people become infected after a sick person coughs or sneezes, spraying virus-carrying droplets into the air, which are inhaled by others.  but chinese researchers say they have found fragments of the virus's genetic material in fecal samples from about a dozen patients.  what's more, in some cases, the viral load was higher in the fecal samples than in respiratory samples, according to the team, led by guangzhou medical university.  chinese researchers found coronavirus genetical material in stool samples from 12 patients, with some having higher loads of viral dna in stool samples compared to respiratory samples. pictured: a nurse suctions the lungs of a covid-19 patient at st joseph's hospital in yonkers, ny, april 20  for the study, published in emerging infectious diseases, the team looked at a 78-year-old man who tested positive for coronavirus early this year.  he was hospitalized in guangzhou, china, on january 17 with a cough, irregular fevers, and abnormal chest ct scans.  five days later, on january 22, the man was placed on a ventilator after his health rapidly declined.  tests detected the rna of the virus in four fecal specimens that were collected between from january 27 and february 7. the patient passed away on february 20.  when the researchers negatively stained residue from a culture and visualized it using transmission electron microscopy, they saw spherical viral particles with spike proteins characteristic of sars-cov-2.  next, researchers collected fecal samples from 27 more patients, 11 of whom had viral rna in their specimens.  the team then successfully isolated the live virus itself in two patients, 'indicating that infectious virus in feces is a common manifestation of covid-19.'  what's more, stool samples collected 17 to 28 days after symptoms began had higher loads of virus dna than respiratory samples.  the live virus couldn't be isolated from fecal samples collected after 28 days but the team still found 'viral rna, 'indicating only rna fragments, not infectious virus.'  the researchers noted the new virus belongs to the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which was also linked to a spread via stool.  hundreds of sars cases in 2003 at hong kong's amoy gardens housing estate are believe to have been caused by stool specimens.  a plume of warm air originating in the bathroom of a sars patient with diarrhea not contaminated several neighboring apartments, but was even carried by wind to adjacent buildings.  of the 329 residents that fell ill, 42 died.  'isolation of infectious sars-cov-2 in feces indicates the possibility of fecal–oral transmission or fecal–respiratory transmission through aerosolized feces,' the authors wrote.  the authors said the findings indicate why it's important for hospital staff to carefully clean surfaces after a patient is discharged from or dies at a hospital to prevent potentially spreading the virus from feces."
health,"a clinical trial of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus patients has been suspended amid safety concerns.  hydroxychloroquine has been touted by president donald trump and he even revealed he took the medication for two weeks as a prophylactic.  but the world health organization (who) said it was concerned after a study from the lancet published on friday revealed higher mortality rates among covid-19 patients who took the drug.  therefore, researchers said they're suspending use of hydroxychloroquine in the who's solidarity trial, which is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four drugs and drug combinations against the virus.  'the executive group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the solidarity trial while the safety data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board,' who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said on monday.  however, other arms of the trial are continuing, including testing of the experimental drug remdesivir and an hiv combination therapy.  on monday, the world health organization (who) announced it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its trial over safety concerns (file image)  who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus (pictured) said the decision came after a study on friday revealed higher mortality rates among covid-19 patients who took the drug  on sunday, president donald trump said he had finished taking his two-week prescription of the anti-malaria medication, which he'd used as a prophylactic to stave off the virus  'this concern relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloraquine in covid-19,' dr tedros said during the press briefing.  'i wish to reiterate that these drugs are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria  'who will provide further updates as we know more. and we will continue to work night and day for solutions, science and solidarity.  the organization has previously recommended against using hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent coronavirus infections, except as part of clinical trials.  dr mike ryan, head of the who emergencies program, said the decision to suspend trials of hydroxychloroquine had been taken out of 'an abundance of caution.'  meanwhile, in the uk, the principle trial is looking at hydroxychloroquine among patients between ages 50 and 64 who have covid-19 symptoms and a chronic health condition such as heart disease, asthma or cancer.  it is unclear how many participants have enrolled, but the trial is expected to continue through march next year  president trump was among the first to wax lyrical about the possible benefits of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus patients in march.  'this would be a gift from heaven, this would be a gift from god if it works,' he said. 'we are going to pray to god that it does work.'  he then repeated the claims on twitter.  'hydroxychloroquine & azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. the fda has moved mountains - thank you! hopefully they will both (h works better with a, international journal of antimicrobial agents),' he wrote on march 21.  the study trump referred to came from marseille, france, in which 30 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine for 10 days combined with azithromycin, an antibiotic.  although very small, the study 'showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage' after the six days and 'much lower average carrying duration' compared to patients who received other treatments.  but weeks later, in a statement published online, the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy (isac) addressed several new concerns with the research.  officials say they found out the researchers excluded data on patients who didn't respond well to the treatment and that they did not clarify what they meant when they said patients were 'virologically cured.'  last week, trump said he'd been taking the malaria drug for a week-and-a-half to stave off the virus.  in an interview with full measure with sharyl attkisson that aired on sunday, trump announced he'd finished taking his prescription.  'finished, just finished,' the commander-in-chief said. 'and by the way, i'm still here. to the best of my knowledge, here i am.'  trump suggested he began taking the drug after two white house workers tested positive for the virus.  'i believe in it enough that i took a program because i had two people in the white house that tested positive,' he said. 'i figured maybe it's a good thing to take a program.'  on friday, a study published in the lancet looked at more than 96,000 people hospitalized with covid-19, including those treated with hydroxychloroquine or its analog chloroquine.  researchers found no benefit for coronavirus patients taking the drugs.  in fact, patients had a higher risk of death and heart rhythm problems than patients who were not given the medicines.  the authors suggested that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine should not be used to treat covid-19 outside of clinical trials until studies confirm their safety and efficacy in such patients."
health,"the majority of americans critically ill with the novel coronavirus become delirious, a new small study suggests.  researchers found that almost three-quarters of us adults admitted to the icu with the virus experience delirium, which continues for about one week.  what's more, coronavirus patients who experience delirium were 10 percent more likely to die than those who didn't.  the team, from the indiana university school of medicine, said that the findings show evidence that doctors need to pay close attention to covid-19 patients so they can quickly treat signs of delirium.  more than 73% of patients admitted to icus with coronavirus experience delirium, which lasts for about seven days (above)  about 87% had hypoactive delirium, characterized by a reduction in physical movements, and 13% ad hyperactive delirium, characterized by motor agitation (above)  coronavirus patients who experienced delirium were 10% more likely to die than those who didn't. pictured: registered nurse sara king attends to a patient suffering from covid-19 in the icu at scripps mercy hospital in chula vista, california, may 12  for the study, published on pre-print site medrxiv.org, the team looked a patients admitted to two level 1 trauma centers.  this included patients who were admitted to icus with a positive coronavirus test between march 1 and april 27.  results showed that delirium occurred within the first 14 days of icu stay in 73.6 percent of patients.  additionally, delirium or coma occurred in 76.4 percent of the 144 patients studied.  researchers also found that invasive mechanical ventilation was linked to greater odds of patients experiencing delirium.  the median score on a scale (from four to seven) that measured delirium was six, which represents severe delirium.  about 86.8 percent of patients with delirium had hypoactive delirium, which is characterized by a reduction in physical movements and a slowing of speech, which lasted about four days.  the other roughly 13 percent had hyperactive delirium, which is characterized by motor agitation and restlessness, which lasted less than one day.  additionally, more than one-quarter of patients with delirium died compared to about 16 percent of patients without delirium who died.  'clinical attention to prevent and manage delirium and reduce delirium duration and severity is urgently needed for patients with covid-19,' the authors wrote.  this is not the first report to find cases of delirium in coronavirus patients.  a study from wuhan, china - where the virus is believed to have originated - found that 36 percent of coronavirus patients had neurological symptoms such as strokes and headaches.  another study from france found that 84 percent of patients experienced these symptoms, even after they left the hospital.  in the us, there are more than 1.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 105,000 deaths."
health,"the virus that causes covid-19 is named for its attack on the respiratory system.  but as doctors continue to report high rates of blood clots, strokes, brain swelling and heart problems in their coronavirus patients, researchers have been increasingly suspicious the infection is more than a respiratory disease, but stumped for an explanation.  one study, published in april, may have found the skeleton key to the bizarre and disparate symptoms striking coronavirus sufferers: a lining of the blood vessels, called the endothelium.  researchers in switzerland found the virus attacks cells that line blood vessels - which may explain persistent clotting and the failure of organs that aren't normally involved in respiratory illnesses like covid-19.  swiss researchers found visible evidence that coronavirus was infecting and multiplying in the lining of blood vessels of patients' kidneys (a, b) as well as signs of inflammation and cell death triggered by the virus in heart and small bowel (c and d) and lungs (d). it suggests that coronavirus is a disease of the blood vessels, as well as a lung infection  many coronavirus patients die not of lung failure, but of blood clots.  in the us, some doctors report as many as 40 percent of their coronavirus patients were developing blood clots.  clotting became such a common and significant concern that doctors started putting people admitted for coronavirus on blood thinners as a matter of course.  but even on the clot-busting medications, the complication often persists.  that's been a baffling phenomenon for doctors and researchers, and one not seen in other coronaviruses, like those that cause the common cold, or the sars virus that caused epidemics in 2002 and 2003, or even in severe flu patients, like those suffering from h1n1.  the researchers at university hospital, zurich, saw a pattern in three patients that piqued their suspicions of how blood vessels might be the common thread between coronavirus and damage to organs like the heart and kidneys.  one patient was a 71-year-old man who had previously undergone a kidney transplant. he died eight days aftre being admitted to the hospital for covid-19.  after his death, the doctors found inflammatory cells and signs that healthy cells had been dying off in his transplanted kidney, heart, and small bowel, as well as clogs in the blood vessels of his lungs.  the second person they studied was a 58-year-old woman who was obese, diabetic and had high blood pressure;  her lungs, followed by other organs began to fail. by her sixteenth day in the hospital, it was clear that part of her intestine was dying. she ultimately died of a heart attack.  in an autopsy, they found the same signs of inflammation in the lining of blood vessels in her lungs, heart, kidneys, small intestine and liver.  and in the third patient, a 69-year-old man with high blood pressure who had to be placed on a ventilator as coronavirus debilitated his lungs, they once again found that the blood vessel inflammation was causing cells in his small intestine to die off.  the researchers concluded that the virus was directly infecting this lining, called the endothelium, of the blood vessels.  coronavirus enters lung cells through a receptor - like a cellular dock - known as ace2.  these receptors are very common in the lungs, and the virus has fairly direct access to these receptors because it's transmitted primarily through inhaled particles.  but ace2 receptors are also found along the endothelium.  that makes blood vessels throughout the body susceptible to infection, which may explain the full-body effects seen in coronavirus patients who suffer from everything from 'covid toes' to the multi-system inflammation condition, kawasaki syndrome, seen in children infected with coronavirus."
health,"one-quarter of americans say there are willing to accept greater risks of contracting the novel coronavirus if it would shorten the timeline of economic recovery, a new study suggests.  researchers found that about 36 percent of people surveyed were 'risk minimizers' who did not want to accept any increases in risk of becoming ill with the virus to reopen businesses.  but about 25 percent of us adults, concerned about the duration needed for economic recovery, said they were willing to accept a nearly 16 percent risk of being infected if it means shortening recovery from three years down to two years.  what's more, 13 percent of respondents said they would accept covid-19 risks of 20 percent or greater to avoid any delay in reopening.  the team, from duke university, in durham, north carolina, says the findings reveal which segments of the population support loosening or tightening restrictions as state governments slowly begin reopening regions.  researchers asked nearly 6,000 people, split into four groups, about covid-19 risk, the span of social distancing orders, and the 'depth and duration of negative economic impacts'  about 36% were 'risk minimizers' who did not want to accept any increases in risk of contracting the virus to reopen businesses (top left) while more than 25% said they would accept a nearly 16% risk of being infected to shorten economic recovery from three years down to two years (bottom left)  for the study, published on pre-print site medrxiv.org, the team surveyed nearly 6,000 adults from across all 50 states between may 8 and may 20.  researchers asked them question about the risk of contracting covid-19 risk, the duration of social distancing orders, and the 'depth and duration of negative economic impacts.'  about 37 percent of people considered reopening nonessential businesses to be the most important policy.  this was followed, in order of importance, by reopening schools and colleges, allowing people to eat inside restaurant, reopening museums and parks, resuming religious service and resuming sporting events.  respondents were split into four groups. class 1 were 'risk minimizers' representing 36% of respondents, the majority, who were in favor of scenarios with lower incidences of contracting covid-19.  about 44 percent of all democrats surveyed and 40 percent of all republicans were predicted to be in this group in comparison with 27 percent of independents.  class 2 were classified as 'waiters', people who preferred delaying the reopening of non-essential businesses until october while class 3 were 'pro-business'.  this means shortening economic recovery from five years to two years was two times more important to them than reducing the risk of covid-19 cases increasing from two percent to 20 percent through 2020.  class 4 was made up of about 13 percent of adults who strongly strongly prefer reopening nonessential businesses 'now' and were referred to as openers.  about one in five independents was likely to be in this group compared to 12 percent of republicans and six percent of democrats.  around 13% of respondents said they would accept covid-19 risks of 20 percent or greater to avoid a delay in reopening at all. pictured: a security guard walks past shuttered businesses in downtown miami, florida, may 7  classes 1 and 2 had a very small maximum acceptable risk for contracting covid-19 in favor of non-essential businesses reopening.  but the 'pro-business' group was willing to increase their risk of contracting covid-19 risk to speed up economic recovery.  they said they would accept a 15.9 percent increase in coronavirus risk to reduce the recovery timeline by at least a year.  and the 'openers' group would accept a 25 percent risk of the virus to reopen essential businesses as soon as possible rather than july.  this risk increased if business had to wait until october to open,  'we hope that the results of our study can support government and public health officials who must make the difficult decisions about when to tighten and when to loosen social-distancing restrictions,' the authors wrote.  'our findings reveal useful information about segments of the population that will be more and less supportive of various policies, findings that do not necessarily track with information reported on social media and traditional media outlets.'  in the us, there are more than 1.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 105,000 deaths."
health,"warmer temperatures during the summer will likely not slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, a new study suggests.  researchers found that virus transmission slows down after temperatures reach 50f or above, but not significantly enough to make cases completely disappear.  states with temperatures higher than 60f would likely see, at their peak, about 140 cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, per million people.  the team, led by harvard medical school in massachusetts, says the findings are evidence that just because it's summer doesn't mean that preventative measures such as social distancing and wearing face masks can be abandoned  researchers looked at daily weather patterns in all 50 states and dc and compared it to the five-day incubation period of the coronavirus. pictured: red line is states with maximum daily temperatures above 52f and dotted line is states with temperatures below 52f  states with maximum daily temperatures below 30f would see 250 cases per million at their peaks, but states with daily maximum temperatures above 60f would see 140 cases per million people their peaks (above)  this means that americans still need to follow preventative measures such as social distancing and wearing face masks during the summer. pictured: dr joseph varon, head of the covid-19 unit at united memorial medical center in houston, texas, checks on covid patient melquiades cervantes on may 6  for the study, published in clinical infectious diseases, the team looked at daily weather patterns in all 50 states as well as washington, dc between january 22 and april 3.  researchers defined their time to diagnosis as five days based on the incubation period of the disease and compared it to the weather patterns.  the average daily temperature was 50f. when the maximum daily temperature was greater than 52f, there was a lower rate of coronavirus five days later.  when the maximum daily temperature was 30f or lower, there was a higher rate of seeing coronavirus five days later.  next, the team created a model of how many cases states would see at their peaks.  states with a maximum temperature of less than 52f would have 23 million more coronavirus cases each week at the peak of its epidemic compared to states with temperatures higher than 52f.  based on the incubation period, that means states with temperatures less than 52f would see 160 cases per million people and states with temperatures higher than 52f would see 137 cases per million people.  states with maximum temperatures 30f or below would see 100 more cases per million at the peak compared to a state temperatures were 60f or higher.  this means at peak, states with temperatures below 30f would see 250 per million people and states with temperatures above 60f would see 140 cases per million.  the model said the estimates remained the same even when accounting for factors such as population density.  'there is an association between temperature and rate of transmission of sars-cov-2 virus which may result in modest decline in the community transmission of sars-cov-2 with warmer weather,' the authors wrote.  'this effect is modest, however, and is unlikely to slow down disease spread if containment measures are relaxed.'  researchers say their study shows that warmer temperatures aren't enough to stop the spread of the virus and that other measures such as social distancing and wearing face masks are still needed.  'while the rate of virus transmission may slow down as the maximum daily temperature rises to around 50 degrees [fahrenheit], the effects of temperature rise beyond that don't seem to be significant,' co-author dr shiv sehra, an assistant professor of medicine at harvard medical school, said in a statement.  'based on our analysis, the modest association suggests that it is unlikely that disease transmission will slow dramatically in the summer months from the increase in temperature alone.'  in the us, there are more than 1.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 105,000 deaths."
health,"a california biotech company claims it has made a nearly 100 percent accurate coronavirus antibody test that screens for the immune cells using just a drop of dried blood from a finger prick.  enable biosciences used the test on 31 people who had recovered after testing positive for coronavirus and compared their results to those of another 25 covid-negative recruits.  according to a yet-to-be-published journal article on the results, the test was more than 99 percent specific and sensitive - two measures of antibody test accuracy that reflect its likelihood to mistake coronavirus for another pathogen, or to miss the infectio altogether.  antibody tests in the us, so far, have been woefully hit-or-miss, but able to reach consumers because the food and drug administration (fda) relaxed guidelines to expedite the use of these tests, which are designed to indicate who has already been infected, and may be somewhat protected from reinfection.  the validation study is small, but the company has applied for emergency use authorization from the fda and hopes that its finger prick test can allow people to collect their own blood from the comfort of home.  using a lancet like this one, enable biotech's antibody test would let people collect a blood sample from an at-home finger prick, and ship it, dried on a collection card, back to the company's lab. a small study found the test was 100% accurate (file)  however, their validation study presents the same one that so many other antibody tests have: it's small.  in a recent interview with dailymail.com, dr susan whittier, head of columbia university's pathology lab said that she received an antibody test that was advertised as being nearly 100 percent accurate.  why is it difficult for scientists to make an antibody test specific for sars-cov-2? coronaviruses invade cells through so-called 'spike' proteins, but those proteins take on different shapes in different coronaviruses. the university of texas at austin were able to map the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 in mid february - a breakthrough for developing a vaccine. it was also a huge step forward for scientists developing an antibody test. there are questions about which antigens (proteins) are best for an antibody test target, 'although the viral spike protein is universally perceived as the obvious candidate', anna petherick, a lecturer in public policy at university of oxford, wrote in the lancet. which part of the spike protein to use is less obvious, and is causing difficulty in creating a reliable antibody test. 'there is a lot hanging on the uniqueness of the spike protein,' ms petherick said. 'the more unique it is, the lower the odds of crossreactivity with other coronaviruses— false positives resulting from immunity to other coronaviruses. 'the most similar of these is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), which led to the sars outbreak of 2002. 'but another four coronaviruses cause the common cold, and ensuring there is no cross-reactivity to these is essential. ' a team at new york’s icahn school of medicine at mount sinai (ny, usa), has published details of antibody tests that use either the whole spike protein. others, such as peng zho at the wuhan institute of virology in china, who was part of the team that sequenced sars-cov-2’s genetic code, have used the nucleocapsid protein and the spike protein. '[the] nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant viral protein, which means it’s easy to detect. but we also chose spike protein because it’s very specific,' dr zho said. 'actually, for coronavirus, the most divergent protein is [the] spike protein.' advertisement  when she read the fine print, it had been tested on 'like, five people,' she said.  'that's crazy,' she said. 'normally that would never happen, but in the middle of a pandemic, you're allowed to push assays out because maybe perfect is the enemy of good.'  currently, the fda lists 13 antibody tests it has authorized and, in recent weeks, it's begun removing and sending letters to makers of tests that it has reviewed and deemed too unproven for use.  but that didn't stop them from getting to market and selling to americans, who might have been misled to believe they had some antibody protection against reinfection - though it remains unclear whether or how much immunity coronavirus antibodies confer - by th inaccurate tests.  blood samples to be analyzed for these tests still have to be collected by a health care provider before they are run in a lab.  for some, that may discourage getting tested, because healthcare settings themselves are high-risk environments for coronavirus exposure.  enable wants to change that.  the biotech firm developed a blood test for antibodies that was 100 percent sensitive and 99.6 percent specific in their tests that used blood collected 15 days after people developed covid-19, and sent an application for its authorization to the fda several weeks ago.  around the same time, they began recruiting participants for a validation study to see if their test performed as well when tasked with analyzing a dried blood sample.  dried blood samples could be collected at home and shipped to labs more cheaply and perhaps with less risk of damage or contamination.  the company has now recruited some 150 volunteers locally and across the country.  on monday, it posted a pre-review copy of the results of testing 56 of those volutneers - 25 who were covid-positive but had recovered and 31 who had never had the infection.  they had the volunteers use their kit, which includes a finger prick collection kit.  they had to put between two and five blood spots on a collection card to dry. the cards contain preservative that keeps them safe for transportation.  participants then simply mailed them back to the san francisco lab.  according to the pre-print, the testing was 100 percent sensitive and specific, returning positives for everyone who had already been confirmed to have covid-19, and negatives for those who hadn't.  'this methodology allows people to get a high-quality test performed by laboratory professionals from the safety of their own home,' wrote co-founder and ceo dr peter robinson in a monday blog post.  'in fact, with the fully-volunteer cohort we have tested so far, we report 100% accuracy of the test, even for kits sent in from as far as the east coast!'  he added that the company is in early talks with the fda about approval of the test."
health,"moderna has dosed its first set of patients in a second phase clinical trial for its coronavirus vaccine, the company announced on friday.  vaccines are a top-priority for health officials and biotech firms in the battle against coronavirus, as a shot to prevent infection would finally make it safe for people to return to work and life to return to normal.  moderna has led the pack in the american race to make a vaccine, with share prices for the company surging last month after it announced promising early results from its first stage of human trials.  however, some controversy arose surrounding these results. critics claimed moderna over-hyped its results in the interest of its bottom line as it sold 17.6 million shares in the hours following its announcement.  first round testing is only intended to indicate the safety of a shot, but gives some picture of its promise for efficacy. this second round of tests, which compare the vaccine to a placebo will provide more objective evidence as to whether or not it will work.  moderna announced friday that it has begun its second phase of human trials for its coronavirus vaccines - but the results of its first human tests are now shrouded in controversy  moderna's 'positive data' on its vaccine was released on may 18.  on the basis of early indicators of an antibody response seen in just eight trial participants, its share prices jumped up 20 percent.  in the hours and days following the announcement, the company amassed $1.3 billion in a mass sale of shares to the public, two executives - chief medical officer tal zaks and chief technical officer lawrence kim - sold off nearly $30 million of their combined shares, and the moderna's primary venture capital investor sold a million of its shares, according to cnn.  the latter two sales were done through automated trading programs for people and firms with involvement in the company - a protection against accusations of using insider knowledge to profit.  but the timing was suspicious and, even if it didn't meet the threshold of insider trading, it raised questions about 'market manipulation,' thomas gorman, a former securities exchange commission (sec) official told cnn business.  'it looks like you're hyping stock so you can then go and sell it.'  in fact that suspicion was bolstered by concerns about the reporting on early results of a small sample of trial participants.  moderna has led the pack in the us race to make a vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection  moderna's chief medical offier, tal zaks (left), and chief technical officer, lawrence kim (right), collectively made nearly $30 million selling off shares after the earlier trial results were announced  moderna's shares shot up by 20% on the heels of its may 18 announcement, and sales of the shares raked in $1.3 billion for the company, raising questions about whether it had used the early trial results to manipulate the market  the eight people in the trial had blood levels of neutralizing antibodies - immune cells that may be able to block the coronavirus - that were on par with those seen in people who had recovered from coronavirus.  only about a third drugs that enter clinical trials make it to final stage testing. so it's not terribly common for big announcements to be made about early stage tests, which may have little bearing on the final outcome of clinical trials.  what's more, university of texas vaccine expert dr peter hotez noted on twitter that some studies have suggested that the level of these antibodies in recovered patients' plasma might not be sufficient to neutralize the virus.  so the trial's highly-anticipated results were 'not necessarily good news,' he said.  already, a handful of investigations into moderna's business practices have begun, although the price for its shares has fallen back to about $61.  and scientists continue to question whether the phase 1 trial was over-hyped.  the vaccine was was deemed overwhelmingly safe, but that trial was not designed to determine if the vaccine will actually work.  now, moderna is making a critical foray in that direction with its phase 2 trial.  all in all, the trial will include 600 healthy adults divided into two age groups: those aged 18-55 and those over 55.  moderna announced on friday that the first patients in each age group and at each dosage level had been vaccinated.  each person in the trial will be dosed twice, with a high dose, a low dose or a placebo.  they'll be followed over the course of a year, with doctors monitoring them for side effects, as well as for signs of a neutralizing antibody.  a stage 3 trial is scheduled to start in july, using the same high dose and a lower low does (about half the concentration of the low dose shot being given in the phase 2 trial).  it's not clear what, if any, results from the phase 2 trial will be reported ahead of its completion next year, but members of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease have intimated that a vaccine could be ready for select use by january.  the study results will ultimately give a clearer sense of whether the phase 1 trial results were in fact just hype, or predicted a successful candidate vaccine."
health,"hay fever, excess screen time, even some medications can affect our eye health. here, elizabeth hawkes, a consultant ophthalmic and oculoplastic surgeon at the royal berkshire hospital nhs trust and the cadogan clinic in london, assesses a range of eye health products. we then rated them.  a massager for puffiness, eye wash to ease hay fever itches — and a pill to soothe damage from hours on a screen  dryness  vizulize hypromellose 0.3 per cent eye drops, 10ml, £1.35, weldricks.co.uk  vizulize hypromellose 0.3 per cent eye drops, 10ml, £1.35, weldricks.co.uk  claim: the maker says these drops will lubricate the eye in the same way as natural tears, to ease dryness and grittiness. they can be used while wearing contact lenses.  expert verdict: dry eye disease is a common condition that occurs when the eyes do not make enough tears, or tears evaporate too quickly. it results in dry, sore or gritty eyes and can be caused by using a computer screen for a long time, windy weather, or certain medications or illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes.  hypromellose, as found in this product, is a lubricant that forms a layer on the eye to stop water loss and increase the thickness of the tear film. this has been shown to prevent dryness.  these drops are free from preservatives, which can trigger eye irritation and discomfort in some people — and it is useful they can be used with contact lenses (not all drops can), which can also cause dryness. 9/10  lagad lacrima, 60 capsules, £13.50, eyecare-shop.co.uk  lagad lacrima, 60 capsules, £13.50, eyecare-shop.co.uk  claim: these contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids — from oily fish and flax seeds — which, the maker says, can help relieve dry eyes. take two a day and see a benefit in one to three months.  expert verdict: omega-3 oils have been found in some studies to improve the quality of the protective oily substance in tears, which stops the eyes drying out. however, a review by the respected cochrane group found that, although there was some benefit for dry eye disease, this was neither consistent nor significant.  also, while the level of omega-3 in this product seems reasonable, there is no consensus on the optimum amount needed — and it is unclear whether enough would reach the eye’s surface where it would, in theory, be beneficial.  these capsules wouldn’t give as good results as eye drops because they’re not working directly on the surface of the eye. they may be worth trying — but only alongside drops. 5/10  opticrom hay fever 2 per cent eye drops, 10ml, £5.29, boots.com  itchiness  opticrom hay fever 2 per cent eye drops, 10ml, £5.29, boots.com  claim: made with sodium cromoglicate, these drops promise relief in two minutes from redness and itchiness caused by allergies such as hay fever.  expert verdict: itchy, red, swollen and watery eyes are a classic symptom of hay fever. sodium cromoglicate prevents the mast cells (responsible for inflammation and allergic responses) from releasing histamine, the chemical produced during an allergic reaction which is responsible for most of the troublesome symptoms.  despite the product’s promise of relief in two minutes, it usually takes a few days to work.  it also contains benzalkonium chloride, a preservative. if you have sensitive eyes, look for preservative-free drops instead. 5/10  optase tea tree oil eyelid cleansing gel, 50ml, £14.78, amazon.co.uk  red and swollen  optase tea tree oil eyelid cleansing gel, 50ml, £14.78, amazon.co.uk  claim: this eyelid wash contains hyaluronic acid (to add moisture) and tea tree oil, which the maker says is clinically proven to repel microscopic mites that live in your eyelashes and can trigger eye problems, such as blepharitis (redness and swelling). massage into eyelids and wash off with water, once or twice a day.  expert verdict: it’s a good idea for everyone with eye conditions or sensitivity to use a specialist cleanser on their eyes, rather than their usual one, to avoid irritation.  one of the triggers for severe blepharitis is an overgrowth of demodex — tiny parasites that live on eyelashes and don’t usually cause harm.  there is good evidence that tea tree oil — which has antimicrobial properties — can reduce their number and improve symptoms such as redness and crusting around the eyes.  the hyaluronic acid here is also very helpful for anyone with dry eyes, as it forms an artificial layer over the eye to help repair the tear film that is damaged in dry eye conditions. 9/10  screen damage  gummy science digital eye support, 60 gummies, £17.45, bigvits.co.uk  claim: these chewable, berry-flavoured supplements contain the nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin, which the maker says the eyes need to filter out the blue light emitted by digital devices. this light is absorbed by the retina and there are concerns it could damage the light receptors there.  expert verdict: lutein and zeaxanthin — found naturally in brightly coloured fruit and leafy green vegetables — are important for a healthy macula (the ‘seeing’, central part of the retina).  however, there is only evidence that people with age-related macular degeneration — the leading cause of blindness in the uk — could benefit, as these nutrients help to slow down the condition’s progression.  exposure to blue light from electronic devices is not considered to be a major risk for macular degeneration — or any other serious eye condition.  there is therefore minimal, if any, evidence to support the use of supplements to protect against blue light ‘damage’. 1/10  the eyecicle eye massager, £150, 001skincare.com  puffiness  the eyecicle eye massager, £150, 001skincare.com  claim: this glass massage wand has a ball at the end, which you roll around the eye area after chilling it in the fridge for 30 minutes.  the maker says the combination of cooling and massage boosts circulation and reduces puffiness and eye bags.  expert verdict: there can be several reasons for eyelid swelling or puffiness, ranging from medical problems, such as a stye or an allergy or infection, to simply having had a late night.  for this reason, i would urge people to see a doctor if they develop puffy eyes, to rule out more serious causes, before using a product like this.  in theory, applying anything cold to the area will cause constriction of blood vessels and therefore reduce inflammation.  so a cooling eye mask or even applying two chilled spoons would do the same job. 4/10  xailin wash, 20 x 5ml vials, £9.45, eyecare-shop.co.uk  irritant in the eye  xailin wash, 20 x 5ml vials, £9.45, eyecare-shop.co.uk  claim: this preservative-free solution contains sodium chloride and boric acid. it is recommended by the maker for washing out foreign bodies that irritate the eye, such as sand, midges, dust, pollen and make-up, to ease the discomfort.  the maker recommends using two to eight vials a day.  expert verdict: sodium chloride is just salt water, which is always the first-line response for flushing out eyes in the case of any injury or irritant.  it is better than water alone, as it is sterile, but it’s generally safer to use a commercially produced sterile product which has the correct ratio of salt to water.  the boric acid here also has antiseptic properties.  eye washes can be useful for clearing out irritants such as dust or pollen. but this is more of an occasional-use product and handy to keep in a first aid kit at home.  for daily allergy relief, eye drops tend to be far more effective because they contain

health,"prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with more than 47,500 new cases in the uk each year.  now ground-breaking research, together with greater awareness — highlighted by the daily mail's end the needless prostate deaths campaign — is changing the outlook for men with the condition. the latest figures suggest it is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, ahead of breast and lung cancers.  'for many years, prostate cancer was a neglected form of the disease but uk scientists are leading the way in prostate cancer research,' says david montgomery, director of research at the charity prostate cancer uk.  today, men with the disease are living longer, with fewer side-effects than ever, thanks to advances in detection and more precise methods used to target it.  research this week revealed genetic screening could spot thousands of cases of prostate cancer that would otherwise go unnoticed until it is too late.  today, men with the disease are living longer, with fewer side-effects than ever, thanks to advances in detection and more precise methods used to target it  the study at the institute of cancer research, presented at the american society of clinical oncology conference, found dna testing in gp surgeries identified the disease in a third of apparently healthy men. a larger study is planned.  and in some rare good news from the lockdown, it was recently announced that for three months men with advanced prostate cancer will be given hormone treatment tablets to take at home instead of going to hospital for chemotherapy. experts have been campaigning for years for enzalutamide and abira- terone tablets to be given as a 'first-line' therapy as soon as men are diagnosed.  trials show that giving patients the drugs early can cut the risk of dying within three years by a third.  there is still a long way to go: by the time around a third of men are diagnosed, the disease is advanced, and more than 12,000 still die each year.  currently, a blood test checking for levels of prostate-specific antigen (psa) — a protein made by the prostate gland, which increases when cancer is present — remains the most common way of diagnosing the disease despite the test being notoriously unreliable.  all men over 50 can ask their gp for a psa test if they are concerned about prostate cancer or have any symptoms, which can include frequent trips to the loo (especially at night), blood in the urine and erectile dysfunction.  a psa score of 3 or above requires further investigation. however, psa levels can rise after vigorous exercise or sex — as pressure from such activities squeezes more psa from prostate tissue into the blood — and 75 per cent of men who get a high score are cancer-free (a false positive), while 15 per cent who do have cancer don't have a raised psa level (a false negative).  however, there's a plethora of new technology in the pipeline that could improve outcomes for men with different types of prostate cancer, as the country's leading specialists tell good health . . .  best for diagnosis  now: high-tech scans  until recently, men with a psa score of 3 and above underwent a biopsy — cells extracted from the prostate — to see if they were cancerous. this can be painful and risks bleeding and infection.  however, a study published in the lancet in 2017, found that giving men with raised psa a detailed mri scan using four images (known as a multi-parametric mri), identified 27 per cent as cancer-free without a biopsy. it also almost doubled the rate of correct diagnosis of fast-growing prostate cancers.  last may, the national institute for heath and care excellence (nice) recommended the nhs use this scan for all men with suspected prostate cancer. but, figures published by prostate cancer uk earlier this year revealed a quarter of uk hospitals are still not using these scans. the charity put this down to a shortage of scanners and staff.  'this is not good enough,' says professor hashim ahmed, chair of urology at imperial college london. 'men are entitled to an mri scan before a biopsy, and if they are not offered it, they should ask for it.'  future: screening and a 'fingerprint' blood test  two uk trials — prostagram and reimagine — are looking at whether a 15-minute mri scan, the prostate equivalent of a mammogram for breast cancer, is better than the psa test.  patients identified as being high risk by this scan go on to have more detailed assessments, such as the multi-parametric mri. results of the prostagram trial, carried out by imperial college london and announced last month, revealed screening men aged 50 to 70 for prostate cancer using the mri scan would pick up 8,000 additional cases of the disease. this would save thousands of lives as the earlier cancer is picked up, the better the prognosis.  the trial, which involved 411 healthy men, found mris picked up 50 per cent more aggressive cancers than using the standard psa test.  old drugs with new tricks: a drug for ovarian cancer called olaparib stops damaged dna repairing in cancer cells, leading to the cells dying, and could be used to fight prostate cancer  in the reimagine trial, 300 men will receive a psa test and a 15-minute mri scan. scientists will compare results to work out which is better at finding signs of cancer.  'we want to see if mri could be effective for screening healthy men, in the same way that there are nhs screening programmes to detect breast or cervical cancers,' says mark emberton, a professor of interventional oncology at university college london, who is part of the research. to introduce a screening programme would be a massive undertaking, but is a possibility in ten to 15 years, says professor ahmed, who led the prostagram trial.  meanwhile, researchers at university college hospital in london have developed a blood test that could diagnose prostate cancer even before psa levels rise, by detecting dna fragments released into the bloodstream by tumours.  they say the test, which could be available in five years, could also monitor how well a treatment works, because if dna fragments are detected this indicates the cancer is spreading, suggesting a treatment is not working — and a different approach can be tried.  'this test could be the first to identify prostate cancer before it is large enough to see on a scan,' says professor emberton. and a new urine test, revealed in journal the prostate in march, could reduce unnecessary biopsies by 60 per cent. the exometh test used a computer program to pinpoint markers for identifying the disease, based on urine samples collected from 197 patients. in the future, gps could carry out these tests, send them to a lab and have results within days, says professor ahmed.  best for early stage  now: ultrasound, cryotherapy and precision radiotherapy  around two-thirds of prostate cancers are diagnosed before the disease has spread. however, traditional techniques — surgically removing the entire prostate and standard radiotherapy — can damage nearby tissue and nerves, with side-effects such as incontinence and impotence.  more precise treatments, known as 'focal' therapies, which minimise side-effects, have been developed.  these include high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu), introduced in the uk in 2005, to heat and destroy cancer cells, or a freezing technique known as cryotherapy, both of which are carried out under general anaesthetic and only target the cancer, preserving the rest of the prostate.  with hifu, a probe put in the back passage delivers ultrasound energy into the prostate, while to freeze the tumour, thin needles are put into the prostate and gas is passed down them to kill the cancer cells. both techniques can also be used to treat the whole prostate if needed.  this sort of therapy is only available at specialist centres or as part of clinical trials.  new radiotherapy technology also reduces side-effects by minimising the amount of healthy tissue damaged during treatment.  it also means that men with prostate cancer can have five high-dose treatments rather than the standard 20, lower-dose sessions.  the technology is delivered using machines called mr linacs, which use real-time mri to provide live, detailed images of the tumour and surrounding tissue.  a study in the journal lancet oncology last year showed this type of radiotherapy was just as effective for early stage prostate cancer, with shorter treatment, while side-effects such as incontinence and sexual dysfunction were comparable despite giving higher doses of radiotherapy.  'it's a real breakthrough,' says professor pat price, chair of the charity action radiotherapy.  future: curved radiotherapy and testing during surgery  earlier this year, scientists revealed a new 'curved' radiotherapy technique, which could halve side-effects. scientists at the institute of cancer research said the therapy involves 'intensity modulated' radiotherapy — in which beams of radiation of different intensities are 'curved' around other parts of the body so that they target the tumour and reduce damage to surrounding tissue.  the prostate is also injected with tiny pieces of gold — which show up on scans — to make sure the beams hit the tumour. the new approach is expected to be available within months.  another approach on the horizon is testing the prostate during surgery, by sending the removed prostate to the lab for checks — a process that takes around 30 minutes.  identifying the precise location of the tumour in the prostate gives surgeons greater confidence in the operating theatre to only remove nerve and tissue close to the tumour, preventing unnecessary damage to other areas.  the neurosafe trial, run by university college london, will compare side-effects after a year in men who had standard full prostate removal using mri and biopsy results, with those having the tumour tested during surgery. best for advanced prostate cancer  researchers at university college hospital in london have developed a blood test that could diagnose prostate cancer even before psa levels rise  now: hormone treatment and chemotherapy  for the 15,000 men each year diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, that has spread, commonly to the bones, the standard treatment is hormone therapy to block the testosterone which encourages its growth.  these drugs are initially effective, but often eventually stop working as the cancer becomes resistant.  recently chemotherapy — which works by stopping the growth of the most quickly dividing cells and is normally administered intravenously in hospital — has been added to the treatment, after a trial in 2015 found that men who were taking the chemotherapy drug docetaxel at the same time as hormone therapy lived an average of 15 months longer than those on hormone therapy alone.  however, chemotherapy can have side-effects such as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, a significant proportion of men don't respond to it, and as with hormone therapy, the cancer can eventually become resistant to its effects.  future: old drugs with new tricks and immunotherapy  a drug for ovarian cancer called olaparib stops damaged dna repairing in cancer cells, leading to the cells dying, and could be used to fight prostate cancer.  research presented at the european society for medical oncology conference in barcelona last year revealed these drugs, known as parp inhibitors, slowed progression of the disease by about four months compared with standard hormone therapy, and prolonged survival by over three months.  another drug being investigated at imperial college london targets a type of genetic material called micrornas which change as prostate cancer progresses. by working out which micrornas are most important for cancers that are becoming resistant to treatment, it may be possible to develop new drugs to block them.  immunotherapy, harnessing the body's immune system to attack the cancer, may be another option. so far success has been limited with prostate cancer, but research published in the journal of clinical oncology last year found one in 20 men — so-called 'super responders' — gained up to an additional two years of life thanks to an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab.  another radical approach is treating the cancer in the prostate even when it has spread.  'cancer cells in the prostate send growth signals to cancer elsewhere in the body,' explains professor ahmed. 'the idea is if we treat the prostate with radiotherapy or surgery, it could break this communication.' a trial of 900 men is under way and results should be available within five years.  identifying tumours that have become resistant to treatment and 'picking' them off is another option. the theory is that when cancer begins to grow again despite hormone treatment, it may be just some of the tumours that have become resistant rather than all of them.  dr alison tree, a consultant clinical oncologist at royal marsden hospital, is researching whether identifying and treating just these resistant tumours with targeted radiotherapy means the rest of the cancer will respond to hormone treatment.  'i hope that in five years we'll be using radiotherapy as standard to pick off drug-resistant parts of the cancer, and this will mean we can keep men on hormone therapy for longer,' she says.  'that means fewer men will die.'  'ultrasound spared me from side-effects' says one of the first patients to benefit from a new treatment to treat the tumours called high intensity focused ultrasound  andy cutler visited his doctor in 2009 after suffering stomach pains, which turned out to be irritable bowel syndrome.  andy cutler photographed at his home in guildford, surrey. he was diagnosed with prostate cancer eleven years ago  as a precaution, his gp sent him for blood tests and, to andy's surprise, they revealed elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (psa).  andy, 58, a retired salesman from guildford, surrey, says: 'i was only 48 and had no typical symptoms, so it was a real surprise.'  he was referred for a scan and biopsies, which showed he had prostate cancer — it hadn't spread.  andy was given a choice of options to remove the tumour. 'i couldn't bear the idea of incontinence and erectile dysfunction, so whole prostate removal or radiotherapy wasn't for me,' he says. 'focal therapy, where only the part of the prostate containing the tumour is removed, seemed a better option, so i went for that.'  the treatment was carried out using high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) energy to destroy the cancer cells.  at the time, this technique had been available for only a couple of years in the uk, but andy wasn't concerned. 'it seemed the least risky option,' he says.  mr cutler visited his doctor in 2009 after suffering stomach pains. as a precaution, his gp sent him for blood tests and, to andy's surprise, they revealed prostate-specific antigen  the treatment was a success, but it took longer to recover than he expected; he experienced pain and needed frequent trips to the loo for the first three months, and erection problems for about six to seven months.  he has since made a good recovery, although monitoring has revealed a small number of low-grade prostate cancer cells that do not require treatment.  'i'm so pleased to have had the opportunity to have hifu,' he says. 'i couldn't bear the side-effects of traditional treatment.  'i go for check-ups every six months, but otherwise my prostate cancer doesn't affect me at all any more.'"
health,"the vast majority of the tens of thousands of patients in the uk who have tested positive for covid-19 will be counting their lucky stars that they have had only a mild encounter with the deadly virus — but they may not be able to relax just yet.  there is growing evidence from china, where the virus originated, and from italy, the first european country to report cases, that patients diagnosed with even a mild case of covid-19 may be left struggling with long-term health problems long after the virus has left their bodies.  'what we have been seeing in hospitals is the tip of the iceberg,' professor roberto pedretti, head of cardiology at the clinical scientific institute in pavia, italy, told good health.  'our focus at the moment is treating patients at the acute stage to help them recover from covid-19. but we also need to consider the future health impacts of the virus.'  one of these is potential long-term lung damage, which professor pedretti fears is going to leave health services worldwide struggling to cope with increasing numbers of covid-19 survivors who are disabled by reduced lung capacity and require extensive rehabilitation to restore their quality of life.  patients diagnosed with even a mild case of covid-19 may be left struggling with long-term health problems long after the virus has left their bodies  in severe cases, sars-cov-2 (the virus that causes covid-19 infection) gets deep into the lungs, inflaming the tiny air sacs and filling them with fluid. this prevents the air sacs doing their job of transferring oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream and taking carbon dioxide out.  this is pneumonia, which in many cases of covid-19 has been found to affect both lungs. as it progresses, patients struggle to breathe, leading to the potentially fatal condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) — where the lungs become severely inflamed.  many patients affected are unable to breathe unassisted and need to be put on a ventilator.  even when covid-19 patients recover from ards, they may be left with pulmonary fibrosis — scarring of the lung tissue, which can lead to increasing breathlessness.  several recent studies have highlighted the growing evidence that covid-19 causes fibrosis. a research paper published in a chinese journal in march reported that 'extensive' evidence suggests that 'pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major [long-term] complications in covid-19 patients'.  this echoes the findings of a study in wuhan, china — ground zero for the coronavirus — where researchers analysed the ct scans of 81 patients with covid-19 and found signs of fibrosis even in those who had had no symptoms, such as a cough or a high temperature (but who had tested positive for the disease).  in the journal lancet infectious diseases in april, researchers said it was unclear if these lung changes were 'irreversible'.  not just a risk for hospital patients  health authorities in hong kong revealed in march that among the first dozen patients who had been discharged from hospital after treatment for severe covid-19, 25 per cent were still suffering from shortness of breath, and 'gasping' when walking a bit more quickly.  despite apparent recovery, 'some patients might have a drop of around 20 to 30 per cent in lung function', says dr owen tsang tak-yin, medical director of the infectious disease centre at princess margaret hospital in hong kong.  the uk's scientific advisory group for emergencies has warned that covid patients could be left with 'extreme tiredness and shortness of breath for several months'.  medical staff transfer a patient of a highly suspected case of a new coronavirus at the queen elizabeth hospital in hong kong, china january 22, 2020  some experts believe that even those who don't require hospital admission could be affected. the chairman of the dutch association of physicians in chest medicine and tuberculosis warned that thousands of people in the netherlands who recovered from covid-19 may be left with permanent damage to their lungs, adding that while many who tested positive weren't ill enough to need hospital care, it was still possible for them to suffer permanent problems.  one theory is that fibrosis occurs as the virus disrupts the wound-healing process. this is what occurred with the sars coronavirus, the forerunner of covid-19, according to a paper published in the journal of virology in 2017.  research published in the journal thorax in 2005 found that six months on, sars survivors' lung function 'was considerably lower than that of a normal population'.part of the problem is the length of time some patients undergo invasive ventilation in intensive care, says ema swingwood, chair of the association of chartered physiotherapists in respiratory care.  those on a ventilator need it for 'much longer' than normal, she says — 'up to 14 days or more'. lengthy exposure to high levels of dehumidified oxygen delivered by ventilation can dry out and damage the mucociliary escalator, the mucus and microscopic 'hairs' that help transport secretions and debris up and out of the airway. oxygen delivered non-invasively, through masks or nasal tubes, can have the same effect if used for prolonged periods.  ema says that 'we are seeing a group of patients left with extreme breathlessness and fatigue'.  even fit people have been affected  it is not simply that people in poor health before getting covid-19 suffer worse. 'we're seeing patients we'd never normally expect to see at all who are totally fit and well and have amazing exercise capacity and lung function, and yet they are still suffering lung problems,' says ema.  how much scarring patients develop — and how well the lung recovers — 'is very difficult to know at the moment', says dr noel baxter, a gp and a medical adviser to asthma uk and the british lung foundation.  'but there are likely to be some people who end up with some sort of long-term problem'.  so does the virus affect our eyes? by alice jaffe the prime minister’s chief adviser dominic cummings last week claimed he had travelled with his family to barnard castle in county durham ‘to see if i could drive safely’. his explanation was that he had thought his vision might have been affected by coronavirus. eye symptoms are recognised as a possible symptom of the disease — conjunctivitis, sticky eyes and red eyes have been reported in around a third of patients according to a small study in wuhan, china, published in march. conjunctivitis is also included as a less common symptom in the world health organisation’s official list. but could covid-19 affect vision? robert maclaren, a professor of ophthalmology at oxford university, says: ‘you would be expected to make a full recovery from the eye problems reported so far, although it may cause temporary difficulties such as blurred vision.’ the royal national institute of blind people says: ‘there is no evidence of sight loss caused directly by the virus,’ but noted ‘research is being carried out into some very rare cases that appear to be secondary to other complications such as blood clots caused by the virus’. advertisement  the british lung foundation and asthma uk have launched the post-covid hub, a website where patients can be put in direct contact with clinicians.  the advice from the foundation for those affected includes techniques for coping with breathlessness and tips on breaking 'unhelpful breathing habits' that can make the problem worse.  for instance, people tend to breathe faster automatically when they feel breathless, and end up using the top of their chest to breathe instead of the whole of the lungs. but this is more tiring for the muscles. the foundation's advice on how to breathe more effectively can be accessed through the post-covid hub website. rehabilitation with a tailored programme of exercise for patients who have had covid-19 will be essential, particularly for patients who have been in intensive care.  but a wider group of people may need help. karen middleton, chief executive of the chartered society of physiotherapy, has predicted that 'in the coming weeks and months, there will be a tidal wave of rehabilitation need'.  professor pedretti has begun trials of a potential new rehabilitation treatment for covid-19 patients unable to exercise enough to restore lung capacity.  the trial will use reoxy machines, which provide interval hypoxic-hyperoxic treatment (ihht). this has been used previously to boost fitness in heart patients.  it involves using an alternating mixture of reduced, then either enriched or normal levels of oxygen, administered through a face mask. intermittently depriving the body of normal levels of oxygen brings about cell changes at a molecular level that make the cardiovascular system more efficient at transporting oxygen.  research published in the journal high altitude medicine & biology in 2018 found that five weeks of ihht training was as effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness in patients as an eight-week conventional exercise programme.  how the virus can harm the heart  evidence is emerging that in some cases the virus may affect the brain, causing seizures and stroke, as well as harming the liver, kidneys, heart and blood vessels.  a paper in the journal jama cardiology in march reported that one in five of 416 covid-19 patients hospitalised in wuhan, china, had suffered heart damage. the researchers also found problems could occur even in those without underlying heart problems.  another study from wuhan published in february noted that of 36 patients transferred to intensive care, 16 (44.4 per cent) were suffering from arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats).  the heart problems are thought to occur as a result of the virus triggering a 'cytokine storm', where the immune system overreacts to the infection, leading to inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).  as a result, the heart pumps more weakly, causing symptoms such as breathlessness. myocarditis can also affect the heart's electrical system, leading to heart rhythm problems.  'covid-19 can affect the cardiovascular system through multiple pathways,' says dr mohammad madjid, a cardiologist at the university of texas.  'the virus may directly affect the heart muscle, which may not work as strongly as it should, causing the heart rhythm to become irregular.'  in severe cases, he adds, there is a high risk of developing clots, which can cause problems in the heart or lungs and may even lead to a stroke.  yuchi han, an associate professor of medicine and radiology and director of cardiac mri at the perelman centre for advanced medicine at the university of pennsylvania, says that people with heart and vascular conditions seem to have more severe damage from the infection.  dr han co-authored research published in the journal heart in april, which reviewed a series of clinical reports from around the world and concluded that damage to heart muscles 'is common in covid-19 and portends a worse prognosis'.  but people with no history of heart problems appear to be equally vulnerable. he says: 'the inflammation that occurs in the heart is not limited to people who have heart or vascular disease and could occur in anyone. however, we don't yet know why in people who do not have risk factors some experience severe disease and others don't.'  such is the feared scale of the heart problems associated with the virus that on april 23 the national institute for health and care excellence issued urgent guidelines 'to help healthcare professionals who are not cardiology specialists identify and treat acute myocardial injury and its cardiac complications in adults with known or suspected covid-19 but without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease'.  in the first week of the pandemic, professor nicholas hart — who treated boris johnson during his battle with covid-19 in st thomas' hospital, london — warned that many patients will emerge from the shadow of the immediate threat of the disease only to face a range of long-term problems.  the expert in respiratory and critical care medicine tweeted: 'covid-19 is this generation's polio.'  it was a stark prediction that is now appearing to be worryingly accurate.  see the asthma uk and british lung foundation post-covid-19 hub at post-covid.org.uk.  super-fit mum left at risk of having a heart transplant  amanda cable, 51, a journalist, lives in blackheath, south-east london  amanda cable, 51, a journalist, lives in blackheath, south-east london, with husband ray, 51, a photographer, and their three children ruby, 21, and twins charlie and archie, 18.  by amanda cable for the daily mail  a few days ago, i climbed the stairs in my house, as i have done countless times over the years. when i reached the top — after albeit painfully slow progress — i paused to reflect on my 'achievement'. the enormity of how life had changed hit me, and i felt tearful.  it's been ten weeks since i fell ill with what at first appeared to be mild coronavirus. since then, i've struggled to walk a few steps, let alone tackle the stairs. i've spent most of my time in bed and any trips downstairs have meant lengthy rests mid-flight.  scaling the 15 steps has become such a symbol of recovery that my cardiologist has told me to make it a measure of my improvement. i was fit and well before i became ill, but i've been warned that as a result of the virus, my health may never recover. i now have heart and lung damage and i've been warned i may one day need a pacemaker or, if i'm really unlucky, a heart transplant.  i fell ill on friday, march 20, when covid-19 felt like a remote nightmare. we'd all had warnings from spain and italy, but like so many others, i watched horrific footage on the news and tried to believe it wouldn't hit the uk as hard.  in truth, i thought i had little to fear. on that day, i went on a three-mile dog walk with ray and felt unusually breathless.  on the monday, i woke with a headache, fever and a sore throat. i wouldn't have even known it was covid-19, save for my strangely swollen left eye — which i'd heard was a symptom. i self-isolated at home.  'i fell ill on friday, march 20, when covid-19 felt like a remote nightmare.'  as the days continued, i had mild muscle ache, shivers and a slightly heavy chest. i remarked happily on facebook, 'it's very mild — i've been lucky.'  but eight days after my first symptoms, my chest felt heavy and i struggled to breathe. soon after, on the advice of nhs 111, i went to hospital.  at a&e at queen elizabeth hospital, woolwich, a doctor said my symptoms were so textbook — they now included a black 'dot' on my toe — there was no point testing for the virus, but the doctor did order an electrocardiogram (ecg), which measures the heart's electrical activity.  the technician checked the printed trace, then re-did the test. he sent me straight back to the doctor, who explained it was so erratic i was possibly having a heart attack.  i was rushed for x-rays. a doctor explained i wasn't having a heart attack, covid-19 had caused inflammation to my heart and lungs. i was the third patient that day with similar symptoms. each had been under 60, active and fit. i was sent home on strict bed rest — and warned movement could cause more damage to my weakened heart muscle, and that the scarring to my lungs may be permanent.  the change in my health has been difficult to grasp. at times, my breathing has been so laboured i have been utterly convinced i would die. at one point, instead of planning my next birthday, i planned my funeral with my husband.  as i fought for every breath, i kept thinking of the years i would miss. my sons going to university. my daughter marrying, and having children. it felt like my entire life and future had been taken so fast.  i've since seen two more cardiologists and after an ecg and echocardiogram — where sound waves create moving images of the heart — i have been told the inflammation to my heart has progressed to myocarditis, severe inflammation of the heart muscle.  it affects the heart's electrical system and reduces its ability to pump. it's now associated with covid-19 and can lead to heart failure, heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.  i'm assured that in many cases myocarditis improves on its own. some cases require medication, surgical treatment — for instance, a pacemaker — and in rare cases, heart transplant. and yes, there's a chance that could be me.  so here i am all these weeks later hoping my heart mends and trying to rebuild my fitness. the scarring to my lungs makes breathing painful and stiff. i await an mri scan to look for signs of permanent damage. my breathlessness affects my ability to talk, and a sore throat limits conversation.  there are other knock-on effects, too. a few weeks ago, i started having strange stabbing pains in my left leg, so i'd dramatically collapse, clasping my thigh, like a cowboy who had been shot."
health,"this week in the daily mail, dr michael mosley is setting out a health revolution that will put you on course to staying one step ahead of coronavirus as lockdown eases.  in exclusive extracts from his new book covid-19, he will help you get in the best shape to fight the virus.  today, he explains why having a healthy gut is crucial to your wellbeing.  this week in the daily mail, dr michael mosley (above) is setting out a health revolution that will put you on course to staying one step ahead of coronavirus as lockdown eases  like any army, your immune system needs feeding to work efficiently and destroy any potentially dangerous invaders such as the coronavirus.  eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals is key here. but did you know you also need to include foods that will support the trillions of microbes living in your gut?  the ‘gut microbiome’ is the scientific name for the 2-3 lb of microbes that live in our intestines, and today, in the second part of a groundbreaking series from my new book covid-19, i will reveal why gut bacteria are so important when it comes to protecting you from the life-threatening complications of covid-19.  a healthy microbiome should be diverse, but sadly, our modern way of eating is decimating the populations that live inside us.  one of the problems is, the more limited the range of foods you eat, the more limited your bacterial diversity is likely to be. many of us eat such a narrow range of foods that our gut bacteria are forced to exist on a restricted diet. and it doesn’t make them happy.  eating lots of processed food, junk food, and unnecessary doses of antibiotics, has laid waste to our microbiome. the emulsifiers added to processed foods in order to extend their shelf life are a problem, too. these detergent derivatives have been shown to reduce microbial richness.  this couldn’t be more important right now because studies have shown our microbiome plays a vital role in the proper training and functioning of your immune system.  having a diverse microbiome is good because it means you have a wide range of different microbes in your gut and the ‘bad’ ones, that do things like encourage inflammation, are in the minority  i’m a big fan of a mediterranean-style diet, which is rich in healthy natural fats, nuts and fish, as well as vegetables and legumes packed with disease-fighting vitamins and minerals.  not only does it taste great, but it is regularly voted by health professionals as the healthiest diet on the planet.  there is so much scientific evidence that adopting this lifestyle will cut your risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, depression and dementia. but now we also know it will improve the workings of your immune system as well.  one of the reasons why the mediterranean diet is so super healthy is because it boosts levels of the ‘good’ microbes in your gut, which play an important role in the body’s immune response to infectious pathogens such as coronaviruses.  stock up on seaweed edible seaweeds (sold as dried nori sheets) or coastal plant samphire, are excellent prebiotics packed with vitamins, minerals, fibre and omega-3 fatty acids. studies showed that people who took a daily seaweed capsule over six weeks saw an increase in 15 different types of ‘friendly’ bacteria in their gut. the easiest way to incorporate seaweed into your meal is to sprinkle dried nori sheets into soups and stews and over salads to give them a tangy, salty taste. or you can snack on mini sheets of dried seaweed, like itsu sea- weed thins, which are low calorie but high in vitamin b12, iodine, protein and fibre, making them the perfect snack for your good gut bacteria. studies showed that people who took a daily seaweed capsule over six weeks saw an increase in 15 different types of ‘friendly’ bacteria in their gut [file photo] advertisement  one reason is the impact that these ‘good’ bacteria have on chronic inflammation. inflammation isn’t always a bad thing. if you cut your finger the inflammatory process makes it feel hot and swollen as your body repairs the damage and keeps infection out.  however, as we get older, inflammation can start to spread throughout the body, becoming chronic and widespread. when that happens it can damage your dna, scar your blood vessels, age your skin and kill off healthy cells. it is linked to a whole range of diseases, including heart disease, cancer and dementia.  but a healthy diet can prevent much of this happening, and one of the ways it does this is by feeding the ‘good’ bacteria that live in your gut. they, in turn, are very good at turning fibre and other nutrients in your diet into chemicals called short-chain fatty acids (scfs), which reduce inflammation in the body.  if you are overweight, have type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma or arthritis — any of the very typical 21st-century diseases — then you are very likely to have chronic inflammation.  unfortunately, this means your immune system will also have become less effective.  not only will your army of fighters be slow to react to a covid-19 infection, and ill-equipped to fight it, but chronic inflammation means your immune system could also be more likely to overreact and cause very serious damage instead.  most people who get covid-19 get either no symptoms or experience a relatively mild illness which can be effectively treated at home. but the complications that lead to an ambulance trip to hospital, and a possible stay in intensive care, can be caused by a malfunction of the immune system called a ‘cytokine storm’.  this typically happens within ten days of first noticing symptoms. if your body has not managed to subdue the virus by then, it may instead start to overreact and attack healthy tissue as well as cells infected with the virus. this can lead to extensive damage to the heart, lungs and other organs. it can ultimately lead to death.  we now know that people who already have chronic inflammation are more likely to suffer from a ‘cytokine storm’. which could help explain why overweight people, and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, are more likely to die.  before embarking on a diet packed with vegetables, pulses, wholegrains and seaweed, it’s a good idea to assess the state of your microbiome [file photo]  this is also why a healthy mix of gut microbes is so important. the ‘good’ guys produce chemicals that reduce chronic inflammation and so help reduce the risk of a ‘cytokine storm’.  they are like firefighters who help put out the blazes that would otherwise destroy your body. but, be warned, there are also plenty of ‘bad’ microbes living in your guts — these are more like arsonists setting fires.  if you haven’t been eating a healthy diet and established a good mix of anti-inflammatory gut bacteria, there’s a risk your immune system lacks the resilience and diversity that is required to establish balanced immune responses.  the importance of a healthy microbiome was illustrated by a recent study of more than 900 people who had covid-19, some of whom developed severe symptoms, while in others the effects were mild.  the researchers found that studying the patients’ microbiome was one of the best ways of predicting who would get seriously ill and who would not.  as well as reducing chronic inflammation, a healthy, diverse microbiome will also help you maintain a healthy weight and keep your blood sugar levels down.  the mix of microbes in your gut can affect how much energy your body extracts from the food you eat; they generate their own hunger signals; they may help decide which foods you crave; they also help to determine how much your blood sugar spikes in response to a meal.  the link is clear when you know that people who are seriously overweight or have type 2 diabetes are at twice the risk of becoming seriously ill if they get covid-19.  so now, more than ever, you want to be sure your gut microbiome is fighting for you, rather than against you.  switch to a sunshine diet the good news is that you can change the balance of your microbiome in a very short period of time by switching to a mediterranean diet. this will not only bolster your immune system by improving your microbiome, but it means you will be getting the full spread of vitamins and minerals that your body also needs to fight the virus. here’s how: eat natural healthy fats in the form of real food, such as olive oil, salmon, tuna, full-fat dairy, avocado, nuts and seeds. these natural fats are also good for the waist and the heart, and will keep you feeling full for longer.  eat decent amounts of protein such as oily fish (salmon, mackerel), seafood, chicken, some red meat, eggs, tofu, beans, pulses, dairy and nuts. you need at least 50-60g of protein a day, every day. as you get older, you need more. restrict your intake of processed meats such as sausages, bacon and salami, as most contain high levels of salt, nitrates and other preservatives which your gut bacteria don’t love.  eat plenty of dark green and coloured veg. these are very low in calories and contain many essential vitamins and nutrients. they also contain lots of fibre, which the ‘good’ microbes in your gut will benefit from. experiment with different types of fruit or vegetables (your gut bacteria loves variety).  swap white pasta and rice for wholegrains and pulses which are rich in fibre. choose multigrain, seeded or rye bread over white. again, the good bacteria in your gut will thrive on the fibre in these foods. if you’re trying to lose weight, you should keep your intake of carbs down.  avoid snacking between meals or late-night grazing. grazing stops fat burning. if you must, snack on non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, cucumber or celery, or a small handful of nuts or a small piece of cheese. fruit is not a good choice, particularly when you are trying to lose weight. ÷ cut right back on sugar or sweeteners.  reduce your intake of processed food, junk food, ready meals and takeaways, tempting though they may be during these stressful times. eating lots of sugary or processed foods will just reinforce and feed the ‘bad’, pro-inflammatory microbes that live in your gut.  drink healthily. plenty of black tea, fruit tea, black coffee and water. as for alcohol, an occasional glass of red wine with a meal is ok, but don’t overdo it.  how good is your digestion?  before embarking on a diet packed with vegetables, pulses, wholegrains and seaweed, it’s a good idea to assess the state of your microbiome.  this quiz will tell you if you’re likely to have a healthy population of ‘good’ bacteria which may just need supporting (with meals packed with prebiotic foods) and topping up (with probiotic foods, such as live yoghurt or sauerkraut).  it could also indicate that your microbiome is in poor shape, dominated by pro-inflammatory microbes which might be driving lethargy, weight gain, mood swings and even health problems.  having a diverse microbiome is good because it means you have a wide range of different microbes in your gut and the ‘bad’ ones, that do things like encourage inflammation, are in the minority.  but problems occur, and your immune system becomes compromised if one group — say, the ones who thrive on junk food — start to dominate. these bad guys can swiftly become much more influential and, by producing chemical signals, induce anxiety, cravings and inflammation.  if you have recurrent gut problems, you might suspect your microbiome isn’t happy, but often you have become so accustomed to being out of kilter that mild digestive discomfort — and the low mood, pain and bloating that come with it — has become just ‘normal’.  take this quiz to find out. if you answer yes, that counts as one point. add up your totals then discover, in the panel on the right, what this says about your gut health.  sleep and weight gain  an unhappy microbiome can affect your ability to sleep well, and can make you prone to weight gain, too.  poor sleep means you produce more of the stress hormone, cortisol, and more of the hunger hormones that drive appetite.  you are more likely to eat badly because poor sleep cranks up your desire for sugary carbohydrates and high-fat snacks, which, in turn, encourage a shift towards the growth of ‘bad’ microbes in your gut.  i don’t sleep well.  i rarely seem to be able to shake off feelings of tiredness.  my weight has steadily crept up over the years.  losing weight is a battle.  poor sleep means you produce more of the stress hormone, cortisol, and more of the hunger hormones that drive appetite [file photo]  mood barometer  the microbiome also influences our brains. in fact, a network of neurons in your gut communicates directly with the brain via a superfast ‘broadband’ connection called the vagus nerve.  studies show that people who suffer from depression and anxiety often have gut problems.  changing your diet will increase levels of healthy bacteria, which then produce chemicals that help improve mood.  these include serotonin and gaba (a neurotransmitter that acts in a similar way to the anti-anxiety drug, valium).  i can be pretty moody at times.  i am prone to anxiety.  i get brain fog and sometimes find it difficult to think straight.  digestion troubles  having an unbalanced microbiome, with too many ‘bad’ bacteria producing chemicals that help inflame the lining of the gut, is called dysbiosis.  common symptoms include constipation, diarrhoea, bloating, fatigue, anxiety and depression.  i frequently get gut pain.  i have irritable bowel syndrome.  bloating and trapped wind are problems for me.  i frequently have constipation or diarrhoea.  i’m prone to indigestion.  childhood links  studies show that children who are born by caesarean section and those who are not breastfed as babies can grow up with a less diverse population of gut bacteria.  you inherit your gut bacteria from your mother, gulping them down as you travel along the birth canal and out into a bright new world.  if you are born by caesarean section this doesn’t happen.  similarly, breastfeeding naturally introduces you to a wide variety of bacteria from your mother.  additionally, a restricted diet of processed foods will lead to a limited microbiome population in later life.  i was born by c-section.  i wasn’t breastfed.  i have always been a fussy eater.  i was brought up on a diet mainly of junk/processed food.  studies show that children who are born by caesarean section and those who are not breastfed as babies can grow up with a less diverse population of gut bacteria [file photo]  medical issues  as well as a poor diet, being stressed, taking too many antibiotics and certain other medications can all cause inflammation in the gut wall, which protects your body from all the microbes that enter your body, along with food. inflammation, in turn, can weaken the gut wall leading to ‘leaky gut syndrome’.  this compromises your ability to absorb the nutrients in your diet and allows bacteria and other toxins to escape from your gut into your blood causing all sorts of health problems, compromised immunity and skin problems.  i have taken antibiotics multiple times.  i have raised blood sugar levels.  i am prone to more colds than most people.  i am prone to skin rashes or thrush.  my skin is bad (eczema, psoriasis, acne)  eating habits  the drugs given to the animals we eat to encourage them to gain weight, and the emulsifiers added to processed foods in order to extend their shelf life, combine to reduce microbial richness.  if you eat fast, and on the move, it is likely you are eating a lot of junk.  i’m not great with vegetables and rarely eat three portions a day.  i eat very quickly and often on the run.  i often eat in front of the tv.  i have no time to cook from scratch so have to rely on processed food.  food preferences  good gut bacteria thrive on variety, but 75 per cent of the world’s food comes from just 12 plants and five animal species.  and most families eat from a limited repertoire of meals with a boringly small range of ingredients — doing this will really limit your microbial diversity.  because the microbiome can influence how much your blood sugar levels rise when you eat, this can have an impact on cravings and appetite control. some bacteria thrive on sugar, others love fat.  they can manipulate behaviour and mood, changing taste receptors, producing toxins to make us feel bad and releasing chemical rewards to make us feel good.  they even manufacture a range of chemicals that are strikingly similar to the main hunger hormones that control our appetite.  i tend to have the same breakfast every morning.  i like the same sandwiches for lunch every day.  dinner for me will be one of less than ten options.  i stick to the same supermarket shopping list each week.  i have strong cravings for coffee/sugar/alcohol.  i’m a chocaholic.  good gut bacteria thrive on variety, but 75 per cent of the world’s food comes from just 12 plants and five animal species [file photo]  now find out what your score means zero to five points congratulations! you and your gut bacteria are clearly a happy team. keep up the good digestive work — continue experimenting with different foods and try adding fermented foods into your diet which are rich in probiotics, living bacteria. although there is no direct evidence that they will benefit your immunity, they are a useful way of boosting your ‘good’ bacteria. one note of caution: if you have not eaten fermented foods before, start with small amounts or you might get some gastrointestinal symptoms initially, such as bloating or gas. five to ten points you probably feel ok most of the time, but it’s probable your biome isn’t as happy as it could be. eating a wider variety of vegetables and other gut-friendly foods will help build the armies of ‘good’ bacteria. ensure there’s more colour on your plate. colour is a great indicator of nutritional diversity. that’s because the pigments plants produce not only give them their colour, scent and flavour, but also means they contain hundreds of different bioactive compounds known as phytonutrients. these phytonutrients tend to be concentrated in the skins of fruits and vegetables. their role in the plant is, among other things, to protect it against fungi and bacteria. but they also have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. phytonutrients in fruit and vegetables come in a range of colours — green, yellow-orange, red, blue-purple and white. the key is to eat a wide variety of colours, aiming for two or more of each per day. over ten points if you scored ten or more in my quiz, there’s a chance your gut might be struggling. you probably know if things aren’t quite right. it might be griping stomach pain, or bloating, occasional nausea or frequent trips to the bathroom (or not going often enough). the lining of your intestine can be inflamed, or hyper-sensitive and vulnerable to damage by infections, some medications, an overactive immune system (which can lead to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease) and a poor diet. if you have major gut problems talk to your gp first. but evidence is emerging that a change to a mediterranean-based diet that encourages the growth of ‘good’ bacteria, might help matters. we know, for example, that as well as shielding your gut from attack, some of the ‘good’ gut bacteria produce chemicals which actually reduce inflammation and help to reinforce your gut wall. you should always discuss any gut-related symptoms with your gp (to exclude the possibility of a serious illness). if you suspect you might have problems or dietary sensitivities, i recommend you try a ‘remove and repair’ protocol for a few weeks to allow any gut inflammation to calm down before launching into a more gut-friendly diet that will help bolster your immunity.  remove and repair  before bombarding your gut with more vegetables and pulses than it is used to, give it the chance to heal first.  one good way is to cut out any potential ‘irritants’ from your diet, then gradually re-introduce them to allow your ‘good’ gut bacteria to re-populate.  troublesome foods include gluten, pulses, milk, eggs, soya, coffee and alcohol.  when your symptoms have settled, slowly re-introduce trigger foods one at a time with a gap of at least three days.  keep a food and symptom diary to track your body’s response to foods so you know which ones to target.  like any army, your immune system needs feeding to work efficiently and destroy any potentially dangerous invaders such as the coronavirus. eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals is key here [file photo]  now try these gut-friendly recipes  asian coleslaw with

implies, resists digestion in your stomach and small intestine. once it reaches the large intestine, it feeds the ‘good’ bacteria which digest it, releasing butyrate which reduces inflammation and strengthens the gut wall. you’ll find lots of resistant starch in grains, seeds (such as flaxseeds) and legumes, unripe bananas and green peas. but one of the more surprising places you will find some of it is in pasta or rice that has been cooked and cooled as this changes the structure of the starch, making it more resistant to digestion. studies have shown that if you boil rice with a bit of coconut oil, cool it down, then reheat it in a microwave, you can increase the levels of resistant starch roughly 15-fold. eating rice this way could halve the amount of calories your gut will absorb from it. studies have shown that if you boil rice with a bit of coconut oil, cool it down, then reheat it in a microwave, you can increase the levels of resistant starch roughly 15-fold [file photo]

health,"the us has sent two million doses of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to brazil to use against the novel coronavirus, the two governments said on sunday.  in a joint statement, the two countries said the medication will be used as a prophylactic for healthcare workers in brazil as well as a treatment for brazilians who have become infected.  both us president donald trump and brazilian president jair bolsonaro have touted the drug, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  trump himself said in mid-may that he was on a regimen of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, even though the us food and drug administration (fda) has issued a warning about its use for the virus.  bolsonaro, a right-wing leader who has forged personal ties with trump, recently said he kept a box of the drug in case his 93-year-old mother needed it.  the news comes just days after the world health organization (who) suspended the arm of its clinical trial of the drug in coronavirus patients amid safety concerns.  on sunday, it was announced the us has sent two million doses of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to brazil (file image)  the drug will be used as a prophylactic for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients in brazil as well as a treatment for infected brazilians. pictured: fluvial emergency workers transfer a 10-year-old suspected covid-19 patient to a hospital in manaus, brazil, may 22  'the american and brazilian people stand in solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus,' the statement said.  'we are announcing the united states government has delivered two million doses of hydroxychloroquine (hcq) to the people of brazil.  'hcq will be used as a prophylactic to help defend brazil's nurses, doctors and healthcare professionals against the virus. it will also be used as a therapeutic to treat brazilians who become infected,' it said.  the two countries will also conduct a joint research effort that will include 'randomized controlled clinical trials,' the statement said, adding that the us would soon send 1,000 ventilators to brazil.  brazil reported a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on saturday, the health ministry said.  it has the second-most cases in the world its death toll of 29,314 surpassed that of france and now ranks only below the us, britain and italy.  demand for the decades-old hydroxychloroquine has surged as trump repeatedly promoted its use against the coronavirus despite a lack of scientific evidence.  'this would be a gift from heaven, this would be a gift from god if it works,' he said in march. 'we are going to pray to god that it does work.'  he then repeated the claims on twitter.  'hydroxychloroquine & azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. the fda has moved mountains - thank you! hopefully they will both (h works better with a, international journal of antimicrobial agents),' he wrote on march 21.  the study trump referred to came from marseille, france, in which 30 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine for 10 days combined with azithromycin, an antibiotic.  although very small, the study 'showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage' after the six days and 'much lower average carrying duration' compared to patients who received other treatments.  but weeks later, in a statement published online, the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy addressed several new concerns with the research.  officials say they found out the researchers excluded data on patients who didn't respond well to the treatment and that they did not clarify what they meant when they said patients were 'virologically cured.'  numerous other studies have found that either the drug didn't help patients, or that patients who took it were more likely to die than those who didn't.  us president donald trump (left) has touted hydroxychloroquine and was recently on a regimen of the medication as a preventive measure. brazilian president jair bolsonaro (right) recently said he kept a box of the drug in case his 93-year-old mother needed it  the fda recently warned of the medication's potential side effects, such as a higher risk of developing an irregular heartbeat.  and a study from the lancet published less than two weeks ago revealed higher mortality rates among patients who took the drug, leading to the who temporarily suspending its use of the drug in clinical trials.  two weeks ago, trump said he had been prescribed hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic to stave off the virus.  the commander-in-chief suggested he began taking the drug after two white house workers tested positive for the virus.  'i believe in it enough that i took a program because i had two people in the white house that tested positive,' he said in an interview with full measure with sharyl attkisson.  'i figured maybe it's a good thing to take a program.'"
health,"keeping at least three feet away from others ad wearing face coverings and eye gear may reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus by up to 80 percent.  a team, led by mcmaster university in hamilton, ontario, canada, looked at how social distancing, face masks and eye protection affect the spread of several coronaviruses including covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).  they found that standing at least three feet lowers the risk of covid-19 transmission, but that standing six feet away cut the risk by half.  what's more, not wearing an eye covering increased the risk of infection by 2.5-fold and not wearing a mask increased the risk six-fold.  however, the researches say that, even when used together, none of these offer complete protection and that other protective measures, such as hand hygiene, are vital to reducing transmission.  a new study from mcmaster university in canada found that standing at least three feet away lowered the risk of virus transmission, but standing six feet away cut the risk by half (above)  wearing a face mask lowered the risk of infection down to three percent, and not wearing a mask raised it to 17 percent, a six-fold increase (above)  the risk of infection from not wearing an eye covering was 16 percent compared to six percent when wearing eye protection - a 2.5 fold decrease (above)  for the review, the largest-to-date on these measures, published in the lancet, the team looked at 172 observational studies looking at how measures to prevent the spread of several coronaviruses including sars, mers and covid-19.  all of the studies, which were narrowed down to 44, looked at how social distancing, face masks, and eye gear affected the spread of the virus in both community and healthcare settings across 16 countries.  'our findings are the first to synthesize all direct information on covid-19, sars, and mers, and provide the currently best available evidence on the optimum use of these common and simple interventions to help ""flatten the curve"",' said co-lead author dr holger schünemann, a professor in the department of epidemiology and enviroment health, from mcmaster university.  'governments and the public health community can use our results to give clear advice for community settings and healthcare workers on these protective measures to reduce infection risk.'  analyzing data from nine studies looking at physical distance and virus spread, they found that standing three feet away was associated with a lower risk of infection.  risk of infection when standing three feet or more away from an infected person was three percent, but went up to 13 percent when standing less than three feet away.  the researchers suggest that for every additional three feet further away, up to about 10 feet, the risk of infection or transmission may halve.  even when all three are used together, the team says none offer complete protection and that other measures. such as hand hygiene, are vital. pictured: people sit inside social distancing markers at domino park in brooklyn, new york, may 27  in a linked comment, one expert says home­made cloth masks are not as effective as masks that have water-resistant fabric, multiple layers, and good facial fit. pictured: charles perez wears a protective face mask and gloves as he waits on tables at the morada bay beach cafe in islamorada, in the florida keys, june 1  thirteen studies looking at eye protection found that face shields and goggles lower the risk of infection compared with no eye covering.  the risk of infection from not wearing an eye covering was 16 percent compared to six percent when wearing eye protection.  however, the researchers note that there is not a great deal of certain evidence when it comes to the benefits of wearing eye coverings.  similar benefits were seen from wearing face masks within households and among contacts of infected people.  wearing a face mask lowered the risk of infection down to three percent, and not wearing a mask raised it to 17 percent.  researchers found that healthcare workers had greater protection against spread of viruses from n-95s and other respirator-like masks.  for the general public, either disposable surgical masks or reusable 12-to-16 layer cotton masks provided enough protection.  the team said lawmakers need to make sure that everyone has equal access and availability to face masks.  'with respirators such as n95s, surgical masks, and eye protection in short supply, and desperately needed by healthcare workers on the front lines of treating covid-19 patients, increasing and repurposing of manufacturing capacity is urgently needed to overcome global shortages,' said co-author dr derek chu, an assistant professor of health sciences at mcmaster university.  'we also believe that solutions should be found for making face masks available to the general public. however, people must be clear that wearing a mask is not an alternative to physical distancing, eye protection or basic measures such as hand hygiene, but might add an extra layer of protection.'  in a linked comment, dr raina macintyre from the kirby institute at the university of new south wales in australia, who was not involved in the study, said the findings are 'an important milestone.'  '[they] also report that respirators and multilayer masks are more protective than are single layer masks,' she wrote.  'this finding is vital to inform the proliferation of home­made cloth mask designs, many of which are single­-layered. a well designed cloth mask should have water-resistant fabric, multiple layers, and good facial fit.  'universal face mask use might enable safe lifting of restrictions in communities seeking to resume normal activities and could protect people in crowded public settings and within households."
health,"after eating peanuts recently, my neck became very itchy. two days later, i woke up with a feeling that my throat was closing. the skin under my chin is still really itchy and hot nearly a week later. i have suffered with hives in the past — could it be that, or have i developed a nut allergy? i am 64.  karen goldman, by email.  your description of the rash on your neck is highly suggestive of an acute allergic reaction to the peanuts, suppressed to some extent by the antihistamines which, you say in your longer letter, you took straight after the reaction started.  there are nine proteins in the peanut plant (or arachis hypogaea, to give it its botanic name) which can cause allergic reactions.  if an allergic response is triggered by one or more of these proteins, the immune system overreacts and produces antibodies called immunoglobulin e (ige).  there are nine proteins in the peanut plant (or arachis hypogaea, to give it its botanic name) which can cause allergic reactions  the presence of ige antibodies is the defining feature of an allergy. they provoke immune cells to release histamine, the chemical which causes many of the symptoms of allergy.  once you have reacted to something, you will always have these ige antibodies present in your blood.  write to dr scurr to contact dr scurr with a health query, write to him at good health daily mail, 2 derry street, london w8 5tt or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk — including contact details. dr scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence. his replies cannot apply to individual cases and should be taken in a general context. always consult your own gp with any health worries. advertisement  risk factors for developing a peanut allergy later in life include a history of eczema, or a family or personal history of any allergies. so the fact you have previously had hives — an itchy, raised rash that can be related to an allergy — suggests you fall into this high-risk category.  if a patient has a mild allergic reaction to something, their gp might initially prescribe an antihistamine. only if there was a recurrence or if the cause was uncertain would a referral then occur.  one option then is for a skin test, in which a tiny dot of peanut extract is placed on the skin of the forearm, which is then pricked with a fine needle. a positive reaction — a raised bump surrounded by redness, along with localised itching — calls for a blood test to check for peanut-specific ige antibodies.  if this comes back positive, it is then recommended that the individual always carries an adrenaline autoinjector (such as an epipen) in case of a more severe reaction — such as swelling around the throat and difficulty breathing.  a negative blood test does not necessarily rule out the possibility of an allergy, as there can be both false negative or false positive results.  your persisting symptoms call for the opinion of an allergy expert.  the fact that your itching and other symptoms began after you started eating peanuts suggests there is a connection. it would be wise to ask your gp for referral to an allergy clinic for further investigations.  in the interim, ask your gp to prescribe an adrenaline autoinjector. always make sure you have this with you, and take care to avoid any possibility of eating peanuts."
health,"about a year ago, i had a really bad migraine that i just couldn't shift. i'd had migraines before but, over the course of two weeks, this one kept coming back.  as a neuroscientist, whose research has covered what happens to the brain during migraine, i was determined to get to the root of the problem. i tried all sorts: i had my eyes tested, and i even went to the dentist to make sure it wasn't something going on with my teeth and causing a headache.  eventually, i identified the culprit: stripes. it turned out that around the time the migraine had started, my wife had bought lots of stripy tops, some with tightly-packed black and white lines, which she'd taken to wearing. (we'll come back to why this triggered the migraine later.)  it is estimated that six million people in the uk suffer migraines. it seems to affect one in five women and one in 15 men, according to the nhs. (the higher rate in women is most likely due to hormones involved in the menstrual cycle.)  if the oxytocin receptors are not fed, then the pain signals pass at full power to the brain. so, for migraineurs, it's hugs to the rescue! sex helps, too  a migraine is not 'just' a bad headache. and not every really painful headache is a migraine.  while headaches can have different underlying causes (such as dehydration or eye strain), fundamentally they are triggered when blood vessels in the brain get bigger (dilate). this process, called vasodilation, is to bring more blood quickly to areas of the brain it thinks are in need. this stretches the blood vessel walls beyond comfortable limits, setting off their pain receptors.  professor amanda elisson, neuroscientist  while this blood vessel dilation happens in migraine, too, it is only part of the process. migraine is a whole-body experience involving a complex pattern of changes in the brain that mean it can also involve nausea, vomiting, appetite changes, clumsiness, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light and fatigue.  early warnings of a migraine  the first phase of a migraine is the 'prodrome' phase — a warning of what's to come. here, there can be subtle behavioural changes which can occur a couple of hours or even days before the aura (a sensory disturbance that accompanies some migraines) and the pain of migraine starts properly.  you might yawn more, be less alert, have cravings or be hungrier than usual. walking into shops with really bright lighting might unsettle you to the point of distraction.  many sufferers are quite bad at spotting this stage. recent work by sanitaria hospital in madrid suggests that only a third of patients are good predictors, in that they could spot an impending migraine more than 50 per cent of the time.  the benefit of cuddle hormone on migraines changes to chemical messengers such as dopamine (important in movement, focus and the pleasure and reward centre of our brain), serotonin (the 'happy' hormone) and oxytocin (the 'cuddle' hormone) have all been implicated in the first phase of migraine — and could provide clues to how to stop them. fluctuations in all these chemical messengers can lead to a feeling that something is not quite right and can make us agitated and cranky, and/or manipulate our behaviour. for example, it makes sense that a dip in serotonin could lead to cravings for chocolate, as chocolate is packed with tryptophan, an essential amino acid which is converted into serotonin in our bodies. meanwhile, dopamine, which is important in alertness, is what tells the brain to trigger the act of yawning, which is common in the first 'prodrome' or warning phase of migraine. so it could be that migraine sufferers have altered levels of dopamine. likewise, migraine sufferers in the 'prodrome' phase often feel disconnected. i have heard many use the phrase 'i just feel needy' — and this is entirely related to low oxytocin. if the oxytocin receptors are not fed, then the pain signals pass at full power to the brain. so, for migraineurs, it's hugs to the rescue! (sex helps, too, but only with partners with whom there is an emotional connection). advertisement  it takes a certain amount of self-awareness to register this first stage, but it could help identify what your triggers for migraine are — some of which you'll be able to control, some of which you may not.  it could also help to make sure that medication to lessen the impact of an attack is taken at the earliest opportunity.  why you may see flashing lights  after the prodrome stage, comes the aura — commonly, seeing flashes of light or blindspots in your vision. most people report that these changes in perception come on gradually, last between five and 20 minutes, and are undetectable after an hour. (if you experience aura for the first time, it is worth talking to a doctor to rule out anything more serious, and certainly if the aura lasts for more than an hour).  in migraine, there is a wave of excitation across the brain, in which many nerve cells become active in a coordinated way.  it is thought that the 'light' of aura is created because the brain area that normally decodes signals from the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) is activated in this wave, too, so you end up detecting 'light' that isn't really there.  alternatively, you might feel things that aren't really there, such as a tingling in your skin, or you might smell something, or hear dripping taps, or taste something that isn't there (particularly a metallic taste).  this is all down to the areas thought to be wrongly activated in the wave of excited nerve cells that takes over the brain during migraine. some don't experience migraine aura at all; they go straight to the 'pain' phase.  it is not clear why some people experience aura and others don't. one theory is that while the same wave of activity is experienced, not all brains translate the brain cell activation into imagined sensation — something that has been labelled 'cortical ineloquence' by researchers.  in migraine, there is a wave of excitation across the brain, in which many nerve cells become active in a coordinated way (stock)  why it's so excruciating  the ubiquitous throbbing pain that migraineurs describe is often centred in the forehead towards the temple.  this is thought to be due to a concept called referred pain, where the unpleasant sensation is felt at a site that's distant from the underlying cause — a result of the brain mixing up messages from various nerves all around the body that will converge at a single point.  it is the same principle that explains why pain down the left arm or jaw can be a sign of a heart attack, because the sensory nerves from your heart are bound up with the pathway from your arm and jaw.  in migraine, where you feel the pain depends on your anatomy.  so what kicks it off? after the wave of excitation (the surge of activity through the brain's nerve cells) comes a sudden depression, where your nerve cells effectively go to sleep.  nerve cells activate through the movement of charged particles, such as sodium and potassium. normally, nerve cells are really particular about what comes in and goes out; but the fast and furious wave of brain activity in migraine means everything ends up in the wrong place.  too much potassium ends up trapped on the outside of the cell and sodium gets trapped on the inside, when it should be the opposite. this makes it impossible for the cells to pass on any signals at all — so everything stops. then, the excess, out-of-place potassium acts directly on the tiny branches of the arteries in the area, restricting blood flow, and also activates pain receptors in the blood vessels.  your brain then arranges a hefty inflammatory response to try to induce vasodilation to regulate blood flow again.  although the nerves only 'sleep' for a few minutes, it then takes another 30 minutes for normal activity to be recovered.  and the excruciating pain triggered can take anything from four to 72 hours to ease.  the trouble with stripy tops …  but why do a migraineur's nerve cells go bananas in the first place? we have some tantalising evidence — and it lies in the visual cortex.  this is an area at the back of the brain that processes information from the eyes. in particular, people who experience migraine have a much more excitable area of the visual cortex known as v1.  if we just had v1 to process vision with, we would see the world as a collection of lines. this is because the millions of nerve cells here only fire in response to lines. (other parts of the visual cortex, imaginatively called v2, v3, v4 and v5, are used to build up the picture, detect edges and movement and overall contrast.)  a women endures a migraine while wearing a protective mask and carrying a child wearing a stripey top (stock)  to test the function of someone's v1, we give them simple visual search tasks, such as picking out a / from a load of \s. this task involves using just the v1, whereas a higher-level visual task, such as finding a particular car from other pictures of cars, would require the other areas of the visual cortex.  harvard research in the 1990s found that migraineurs were much faster than a control group (who did not suffer migraines) at the v1 task, but no better at higher-level visual tasks.  further research has shown that this advantage is linked to hyperexcitability of v1. even outside of a migraine episode, these neurons are on a hair trigger for activation.  which brings me back to those stripy tops. the wave of excitability in migraine seems to be triggered by a certain spatial frequency, or how close together the lines are. that's why not all patterns of lines around us set it off, and it's fair to say that every migraineur might have a different spatial frequency that triggers them.  activate every single v1 neuron by presenting lines of orientation packed together in a neat rectangle, though, and you will trigger all migraine sufferers.  after i forbade my wife from wearing stripes in my presence, my migraine went away.  when it's a sign of a heart problem  there is another surprising trigger for migraines — and it involves the heart. before you were born, instead of using your lungs, you got all your oxygen through the placenta.  for a baby in the womb, blood comes in from the body in the regular way, on the right side of the heart; but then instead of being redirected to the lungs to collect oxygen, it passes through an open passage between the top chambers of the heart, called the foramen ovale. the left side of the heart then redistributes this blood around the foetal body.  after birth, the foramen ovale seals itself in 80 per cent of people, but in some cases it stays open, leading to the condition's name: patent foramen ovale.  the truth about cheese and chocolate it's often said that cheese and chocolate are 'triggers' for migraine headache — but in fact it's the other way around. it is the change in your brain chemistry in the early phase of migraine that's making you crave chocolate or cheese. this may be because some of the hormones and chemicals we suspect are involved in causing migraine, such as orexin and neuropeptide y, also influence appetite and can make you crave specific foods. migraineurs are often attracted to sweet foods — perhaps to help you cope with what is to come. or it might be that poor diet has led to a hormone imbalance in the brain, which it's now encouraging you to replenish.  the condition often goes undiagnosed as it doesn't cause any noticeable problems. but we now know it can be a possible anatomical cause of migraine. swiss research has found that 47 per cent of people who get migraines had a patent foramen ovale.  when pressure is created in the chest by coughing or sneezing, the partially sealed flap between the heart chambers can be forced open, meaning blood can flow in either direction.  if blood passes from the right to the left, it isn't passed through the lungs, which act as an important filtration system, removing bits of debris, such as small blood clots. this unfiltered blood then has a direct route to the brain.  any debris could stop blood flow to that area. in a worst-case scenario, nerve cells die, leading to stroke; or it can trigger a migraine as the blockage changes activity in that area and sets up the wave of excitation in the nerve cells.  once patent foramen ovale is diagnosed, treatment becomes more straightforward. beta-blockers, which make your heart beat more slowly and with less force, have shown some success.  it is also now possible to have surgery to re-seal the flap.  extracted from splitting, by amanda ellison, published by green tree on june 11 at £16.99. © amanda ellison 2020. to order a copy for £13.60, visit bloomsbury.com and quote code dailymail (offer valid until june 23, 2020)."
health,"social distancing and lockdowns have helped cut the rate of novel coronavirus transmission by half in most us counties, a new study suggests.  researchers from johns hopkins university looked at the rate of transmission is more than 1,400 countries across the country both over a two-month period.  they found that about 82 percent have been able to reduce transmission rates to below r1, meaning infected people spread the disease to less than one other person.  additionally, they found that urban counties responded better to local orders while rural and suburban counties had better responses when orders came from the federal government.  a new study found that 82% of 1,400 us counties have been able to reduce coronavirus transmission rates to below r1, meaning less that one person is infected from a sick patient  counties with little public transportation use were able to more quickly reduce transmission rates compared to counties with high use (above)  the r0 (r-naught value) is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is.  the numbers that follows 'r' tells you the average number of people who will contract the disease from an infected person.  for the study, published on pre-print site medrxiv.org, the team differentiate among groups of counties using an approach known as clustering.  each cluster, from 1 to 5, was grouped together by have similar demographic and socioeconomic attributes.  cluster 1 was made up of low-income and mainly rural counties while clusters 2, such as orlando, had populations of about 45,000 and higher incomes.  cluster 3, like hawaii's big island, had similar populations to cluster 2 but with lower incomes and more land area.  comparatively, cluster 4 had the densest populations with high household incomes, good public transit and small land area, like new york city.  meanwhile cluster 5 had the highest mean population but poor public transit and lower household income, such as jackson, mississippi.  urban counties responded better to local stay-at-home orders while rural and suburban counties had better responses when orders came from the federal government. pictured: an aerial view shows people gathered inside painted circles on the grass encouraging social distancing at dolores park in san francisco, california, may 22  once clusters were identified, the team deduced the reproductive rate of the virus, known as sars-cov-2, from march 15 to may 28.  all cluster started out with a similar reproduction rate of sars-cov-2, but the speed at which they reduced the rate differed.  denser urban counties, seen in purple, which had higher reliance on public transit, like new york city and chicago, decreased slowly over the entire study period.  the researchers note this is particularly see between march 15 and march 25.  by comparison, areas with little transportation use, such as those seen in orange, were able to quickly reduce transmission rates due to being more spread out.  researchers found that most counties exhibited had an initial reproductive rate of r3 or above when the pandemic first hit.  but, as of may 28, 1,177 out of the 1,417 us counties - or 82 percent - have reduced the reproductive rate to below r1.  additionally, the model found that there was different behavior across counties.  for example, metropolitan counties (in purple) had a strong response to local stay-at-home orders while rural and suburban areas (red, green, blue and orange) had a stronger response to more national interventions.  these less restrictive national interventions include promoting social distancing, encouraging testing and recommending the use of masks.  the team, also found that among all counties, the level of infection ranged from 0 to 28.7 percent.  they also noted herd immunity is only likely reached after 50 percent of 70 percent of the population has been infected and recovered, meaning herd immunity is far away even for counties with widespread infection.  'our results suggest that strategies for shutdown as well as re-opening require careful consideration of county characteristics in addition to state and national trends,' the authors wrote."
health,"hey, it's paw-ty time! happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me! dilyn the dog here, the nation's numero uno hound, downing street top dog, celebrating being one year old this week.  what can i tell you about my life so far, fans? i was born in merthyr tydfil, in a faraway land called wales; a place where the daffodils are yellow and so is the snow, if i've got anything to do with it.  i was rescued from a breeder because i was going to be put down. i don't even know what that means. down on the floor, down in my basket?  downing street's dog dilyn has celebrated turning one this week and looks back on his crazy first year as the country's top dog  i was adopted by my wonderful humans boris and carrie and came to live here in london, in the heart of your government. all of a sudden, i was famous!  right up there with scooby doo, pluto, lassie, snoopy, mutley, pongo, gnasher and toto — or the cabinet, as you ethem.  what a crazy 12 months it has been, as i told jan moir...  1: downing st here i come, september, 2019  cameras filmed me being carried into no 10 in my very own doggy bag. i wore a matching neckerchief, but i looked a little nervous.  there was good reason. i was a young pup with everything to live for — and i was going to grab this opportunity with two paws.  in september 2019, dilyn was pictured being carried into no.10 for the very first time in a doggy bag  2: larry, chief mouser  my first shock. larry the cat and i had to share a home?  listen motherpuppers, you've gotta be kidding me. he was about as friendly as a liaison committee — and look at the size of him!  larry has been here for 13 years through four prime ministers — and, boy, doesn't he let you know it.  he is always posing around no 10's front door.  he doesn't understand that there is a new kid in town. no wonder he doesn't like me.  the downing street cat larry has been at no.10 for 13 years through four prime ministers and now has to share his home with dilyn  3: campaigning for goldsmith  don't i look smart in my true blue lead? we were campaigning for an mp called zac goldsmith, who went right ahead and lost his seat.  what a waste of my time! i'll never get those doggy years back.  zac may have failed with the electorate, but to cheer him up he was given a life peerage and a fancy title as minister for the pacific, trees, weather, clouds, international snowballs and group tiddlywinks.  dilyn became involved in politics when he joined carrie symonds out campaigning for zac goldsmith, who lost his richmond park seat in the election  i'm new to the game, but sometimes i feel i will never understand politics.  zac is a minister for animal welfare, too. so maybe he could sling some chews my way, for a start? after everything i've done for him...  4: antlers and tinsel at christmas, december, 2019  loving the christmas tinsel collar, but i am not sure about these reindeer antlers.  is it beneath my dognity as a proud jack russell to be dressed like this?  or should i just go with the festive flow and not mind looking like a dog's breakfast?  why don't we hold a rufferendum on the subject ...  dilyn celebrated his first christmas at downing street with new owners boris johnson and carrie symonds by wearing a stylish tinsel necklace  carrie symonds shared a photo of her dog in christmas fancy on social media, writing 'i'm sorry dilyn. i am a bad mother' alongside the hilarious photo  5: smart union jack coat, february 1, 2020  brexit is here at last and i'm in a union jack coat to celebrate. it gives me a statesmanlike air, don't you think?  like my master boris, i am developing a taste for power, the cut and thrust of political life. it is intoxicating! don't call me, i'll woof you.  i'll get my people to sniff your people. let's all dig a big hole, then jump in. dominic, you can stop digging now!  which reminds me. mr cummings was sitting in the garden while lots of people asked him questions. weird or what?  my opinion was also solicited by laura kuenssberg.  she rubbed my tummy — so i told her everything.  brexit arrived on february 1 and a dilyn was photographed wearing in a union jack coat to celebrate was shared on the dog's instagram  6: true love with bailey javid, valentine’s day, 2020  i have fallen in love with bailey, the doggo to the treasury who lives next door with sajid javid’s family.  she is blonde, gorgeous and, most importantly, she is not too fussy. in the garden every morning, we romp together in bliss.  for i am just a boy, standing in front of a cavapoo, asking her to roll in the squirrel poop with me. and she does!  we dream of dating, of meeting incognito in a local pub, where i will say: ‘make mine a double and give one to the bitch at the end of the bar.’  dilyn spent valentine's day 2020 with bailey javid, the dog to the treasury. but dilyn was heartbroken when his best friend disappeared from next door  but something terrible has happened. one day bailey was there, the next she was a gone girl. i lost my mind, i lost all my dognity, i went mad with grief. was it something i woofed?  no. mr javid left in a hurry after something the humans call an ‘unhelpful political row’.  ‘don’t you worry, dilyn,’ boris said. ‘there are plenty more blondes in the park.’  well, i guess he would know!  7: the reshuffle that never was, march 12, 2020  i nearly choke on my breakfast. i am as sick as a dog. a so-called newspaper has reported that boris and carrie have ‘grown weary’ of me and that i might not make it through the next domestic reshuffle.  they say that our home is full of ‘dog s**t’ and that i am more of a pest than a pet. what?  i blink back tears. yes, i admit there has been the occasional whoopsie.  but nothing compared to the mess mr hammond used to make over at the ministry of defence. or mr hancock is currently doing in sickness and in health.  a newspaper reported that boris and carrie have ‘grown weary’ of dilyn and that he might not make it through the next domestic reshuffle - but luckily he made it out the other side  larry the cat thinks my apparent demise is hilarious but, lucky for me, carrie agrees with my version of events. ‘hush, puppy,’ she says, and gives me a kiss. then she puts out a statement.  ‘there has never been a happier, healthier and more loved dog than our dilyn,’ she thunders. woof! i adore that girl.  8: carrie and i isolate together, march 27, 2020  pregnant carrie and i are worried about boris, who is lying in his hospital sickbed. she is missing her human partner but she is not alone in isolation — she has me.  i am trying to be here for her, to be a comfort and a good boy.  ‘there were times that were very dark indeed. my heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones,’ she tweeted.  boris johnson was hospitalised amid the coronavirus pandemic but dilyn stayed home to self-isolate with carrie symonds  when boris was on the mend, she thanked the nhs and the staff at st thomas’ hospital. ‘i will never stop thanking you,’ she said.  anydog else she wants to thank? i think we all know who.  9: enter baby wilfred, may 3, 2020  ahem. i did not sign up for this. a baby was not in my social contract. who thought this was a good idea?  one minute carrie is all #adoptdontshop and #adogisfor life, rubbing my tummy and asking if i am a good boy, a lovely boy, the best boy in the world.  the next she is popping out another johnson — like the world needs more of them!  wilfred lawrie nicholas johnson was welcomed to the family on april 29 at 9am, named after both boris and carrie's grandfathers  and then — this is the worst bit — bringing him home to live with us. however, wilfred is cute, he smells nice and he makes funny noises.  sometimes there is bawling all night long, but apparently that is not the baby, it’s mr sunak looking at the economic forecasts.  10: jogging with boris, may 25, 2020  just exactly who is the rescue animal here? my master boris is still struggling to get back to full fitness, but everyone can see the efforts he is making.  and who is right by his side? not larry the cat but me, dilyn the dog, his right hound man.  we’re going to stick this out together, come what may, one paw after the other, on the long walkies of life. woof!"
health,"widespread testing and contact tracing are emerging as the clear public health tools that the us needs in order to to reopen.  and one sub-sector of the economy that's been using these methods for decades may be an untapped resource for guidance on how to make it work: the porn industry.  since the early 1990s, the free speech coalition, the trade association of the adult film industry, has used a system of regular sexually transmitted infection (sti) testing and contact tracing to protect the health of performers, particularly to ensure they don't contract hiv.  through its performer availability scheduling services (pass) program, entertainers are tested bi-weekly for clearance to work - and there hasn't been a single instance of on-set transmission of hiv since 2004, according to a spokesperson.  like the mainstream film industry, adult entertainment shoots are currently shut down, but its leaders are hard at work developing safety measures in addition to the kinds of sanitization and testing practices that they've long used and which are now being ramped up across the us.  adult film performers get tested for stis every two weeks and can only perform if they're tested on time and are negative for hiv. the industry's testing and contact tracing program is not unlike those that the us is trying to launch to help reopen the us amid the coronavirus pandemic (file)  mike stabile, a spokesperson for the free speech coalition, told dailymail.com that the porn industry has a lot to teach about minimizing health risks in the workplace, yet other businesses and public health officials - including dr anthony fauci, who made his name in hiv research - have not come to them for advice.  the free speech coalition and the pass program were formed amid the aids crisis in the us.  the first case of aids among american performers was identified in 1984, sending shockwaves and fear through the industry.  it happened long before the peak of the aids crisis, when testing was still spotty and the devastating virus and resulting disease were poorly understood.  but members of the industry sprung into action and by 1998, regulated testing was up and running.  that same year, there was a devastating outbreak. one male performer who contracted hiv gave it to eight women and the industry was altered for a time. regular testing continued, and scenes without condoms were banned.  it was another six years before on set transmission happened again. in 2004, another male performer got sick, initially tested negative for hiv, and went to work. three female performers contracted the virus.  so far, only nine us states are testing enough people to meet the requirements for reopening  and in the 16 years since, there hasn't been another instance.  in 2018 alone, 37,832 people in the us as a whole contracted hiv.  'part of what protects performers and society at large is that we have a heavily tested population so the risk of [infection] coming in at all is very low,' mike stabile told dailymail.com.  it's exactly the sort of widespread testing that public health experts have called for, and its absence is considered a major factor in allowing coronavirus to spread like wildfire in the us.  now as the us states eye reopening dates, officials are trying to work out how to test people and trace their contacts efficiently, without violating privacy laws.  the porn industry has created a well-oiled machine to do exactly that.  how testing and contact tracing work in the adult entertainment industry  the primary advantage that the adult film industry - and public health writ large - has in preventing hiv transmission over our ability to slow the spread of coronavirus is knowledge.  hiv symptoms usually set in between two and 12 weeks after infection.  so adult film stars are required to get tested every 14 days.  when a performer arrives on set, they have to give their official identification (many work under stage names) and their information is plugged into the pass system.  their identity is verified and either a green check mark or a red 'x' appears next to their name.  a green check means they've been tested within two weeks, and were negative for hiv.  a red 'x' doesn't necessarily mean that they have contracted an sti. it simply means they're not cleared to perform that day, either due to their test results or because they haven't been tested recently enough.  when performers arrive on set, their identities are checked, and they can only work if a green 'check' appears next to their name, meaning they've been tested recently and are hiv-negative  it's a hard and fast rule: red 'x,' go home, no on-set work that day.  importantly, the pass system doesn't disclose any other information about the performer, protecting their privacy and remaining in compliance with health insurance privacy and portability act (hippa) laws.  in the event that someone's results do come back positive, everything grinds to a halt.  'as soon as they get the call, the industry shuts down,' stabile said.  'someone could be in the middle of a shoot and the shoot just stops and everyone goes home.'  it's not unlike a resumption of lockdown that officials like governor andrew cuomo have said would happen after states reopen if positive coronavirus tests hit a threshold.  after that shut down, the performer is called back to the clinic to disclose who they've shot scenes with and their partners in their personal life.  pass makes sure all contacts are traced without sacrificing privacy  'we cast a wide net in terms of the information we're requesting from the studios but we don't disclose anybody's information publicly, the only person who might now is the person at free speech who might be handling the medical information,' with the performer's consent, stabile said.  'medical and performer privacy are so central to the industry because [performers] deal with stalkers and they have family and other jobs.'  a similar system might circumvent privacy concerns over things like tracing apps devised for use in addressing the coronavirus pandemic.  but the most important element of keeping up with coronavirus, is simply testing, as stabile emphasized.  'we've got to get on a testing system, a regular testing system, until we're able to bring these risks down to a reasonable level,' he said.  apps like covid tracker could help trace contacts of people who test positive, but privacy concerns abound. the porn industry's pass program allows anonymous contact tracing  to-date, 8.4 million americans have been tested for coronavirus. it's a big number, but a small fraction of the country's population of 328.2 million.  and antibody testing so far suggest that far more people are infected than have tested positive.  so far, studies suggest that antibodies - and whatever immunity they might confer - probably lasts about two weeks, at least.  much like the porn industry's testing, bi-weekly testing might then help catch cases early and keep limit the spread of coronavirus.  the pass program has also worked out how to balance the burden of testing with risk assessments.  for other stis, for example, a single instance or even a handful of cases of chlamydia or gonorrhea would not necessarily trigger a shut down. but if a cluster emerges, it might become necessary.  until there is a vaccine for coronavirus, a zero transmission rate is effectively impossible.  but a system that could flag clusters or surges of infections - like those seen at meat packing plants in states that have begun to reopen already - could offer a middle ground between full lockdown and a free-for-all.  how porn is preparing to get back to work  stabile says the industry doesn't yet have a date, threshold or plan for getting back to work. in los angeles, where he and much of the adult entertainment field is based, mainstream films are still on hold, too.  he and an industry task force are meeting regularly, however, and developing their own systems and best practices to keep performers and crew members safe when they do resume filming.  people working in the porn industry are accustomed to making sure that surfaces get thoroughly sanitized. they're preparing to expand that to other surfaces to prevent coronavirus when shooting resumes (file)  stabile says the industry has a significant leg up in coming up with those solutions.  'we are very familiar with dealing with bodily fluids,' he said.  they're considering expanding sanitization practices beyond the obvious relevant areas of a set to things like doorknobs and showers.  long before the rest of the us was wearing gloves to the grocery store and regularly disinfecting handrails, the porn industry was doing so.  no one is asking the industry that figured out how to cope with one virus how to deal with coronavirus  ultimately, figuring out how to limit the risks posed by a sneeze or cough, testing and tracing contacts from those fluids isn't such a far cry from figuring out how to limit transmissions that occur through sex.  'in many ways, what they are doing is a model for what we are trying to do with covid', drashish jha, director of harvard university’s global health institute told stat news.  'the adult film industry teaches us that as a proof of concept, this can work. we just have to scale it up.'  but no one has come to them for advice yet, stabile said.  'i would recommend that they do so, but we’re fairly stigmatized industry and i think they might be embarrassed,' he told dailymail.com  'they shouldn’t be, because this is something we know so much about.  'we try to separate morals and politics in that discussion [of safety] because the more those play a part, the less effective the recommendations are going to be.'"
health,"media coverage of poor health is littered with defiant military metaphors. individual battles are fought against illness; wars are launched against diseases; medicines are weaponised and locked on target.  ‘we are undefeatable,’ declares one tv advert for a campaign run by the richmond group of charities. use of martial language is particularly common in the coronavirus pandemic as ministers pledge to combat the lethal disease and boris johnson was hailed as ‘a fighter’ during his ordeal in intensive care.  well, i don’t feel very heroic these days as i shuffle around with my

impairs the functioning of the body.  i cannot deny that the onset of the condition has been a heavy blow, even though i try not to let it dominate my life.  the eccentric singer ozzy osbourne, who has also been diagnosed with the disease, said recently, in his inimitable brummie style, that it has ‘knocked the s**t’ out of him’. i feel much the same way.  i am only 57, but in several respects i am like an old man. stooped forward, i struggle to walk any distance without a stick, while my foot-dragging gait resembles that of a zombie extra in a seventies horror movie.  i regularly feel exhausted and have to take long naps during the day, yet at night i am often seized by sleeplessness, partly because of pains in my limbs and neck. moments of stress can leave me shaking, though at other times, i am as inert as a stone on easter island, complete with a frozen expression on my face.  because of the rigidity in my back and legs, getting dressed is a lengthy process, especially where trousers and socks are involved.  beautiful, kind and funny, my wife elizabeth (pictured together) has been the most wonderful support throughout this saga, supplying all the positivity i lack. her patience has been boundless, her devotion unceasing, writes leo mckinstry  i should not complain too vociferously at a time when so many lives are being taken and families wrecked by covid-19. with the death toll soaring, the unprecedented emergency has put my own problems into perspective.  moreover, i am aware that, apart from the coronavirus, there are millions of people in britain who are suffering far worse health, especially with terminal cancer and severe disabilities. nevertheless, parkinson’s has cast a long shadow over my life.  the journey onto this forbidding territory began about 18 months ago, when i first noticed a persistent tremor in my left leg while sitting at my desk.  gradually this tremor spread to my other limbs, accompanied by extreme stiffness, which hindered even routine tasks such as rising from a chair.  for most of my life i have been quite even-tempered, but i began to succumb to waves of anxiety, fuelled by irrational fears such as my house burning down, that i would fall into debt or that jeremy corbyn would become prime minister. in addition, over the first six months of 2019, my handwriting went into decline.  through internet searches, i soon learnt that all these traits were symptoms of parkinson’s. but, unwilling to face this reality, i told myself i was suffering from a recurrence of sciatica, a back problem for which i had an operation in the mid-eighties.  it was an act of self-deceit that entailed fruitless visits to osteopaths across southern england. but by september last year, a year after my symptoms started, the problem was so bad i decided to see a back specialist.  as soon as i limped into his room in central london, my delusions were shattered.  ‘i am afraid there’s no point in my examining your back. i am pretty certain you have parkinson’s,’ he said in an authoritative but kindly manner.  i managed to remain phlegmatic at the time, helped by the freezing of my features (another symptom of parkinson’s). but when i left and phoned my wife elizabeth to give her the bad news, i started to cry. it must have been a pitiful sight, a grown man standing in the street with his hands trembling and tears rolling down his cheeks.  in my heart i had guessed this would probably be the diagnosis. nevertheless, the bold pronouncement came as a shock.  yet the collapse did not last long. i soon managed to pull myself together, attend a meeting with my publisher, then commute back to our home near margate.  the back specialist arranged for me to see (privately) a neurologist, professor michael hanna, within days, who conducted tests including brain scans.  around 145,000 british people are estimated to parkinson’s disease it, and every hour, two new cases are diagnosed (stock image)  in october, i visited him again to receive his verdict. he confirmed that i had parkinson’s, which he explained is due to the death of brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that regulates the body’s movements.  he said that without treatment, my decline would gather pace, further restricting my movements and making me vulnerable to falls. it was a bleak prospect. to counter the loss of this vital chemical, he suggested i begin taking a drug called ropinirole, which works by imitating the actions of dopamine.  i asked him about potential side-effects. with a suppressed twinkle, he warned that a few patients have been known to become sexually compulsive or to develop gambling addictions. it was a statement that alarmed rather than intrigued me, but i felt i had no alternative than to try the drug.  despite my daily consumption of ropinirole since october, i did not transform into the harvey weinstein of margate, nor did i ever feel any temptation to enter the local bookies.  unfortunately, the medication did not have much impact on my health, apart from making me drowsy. after a few months, i was as stiff, shaky and slow as ever.  professor hanna advised that, in addition to ropinirole, i should take a drug called levodopa.  unlike ropinirole, which only imitates the effect of dopamine, levodopa is converted by enzymes in the brain directly into dopamine and, therefore, if it works, actually replaces this vital chemical messenger. i am now up to 11 pills a day; eight levodopa and three ropinirole, though that is no great burden, as the side-effects amount to little more than some weariness.  there has yet to be a spectacular improvement, but i feel better than i did late last year: my mood swings have lessened and my tremors have reduced significantly.  but i am willing to try alternative remedies, to give me a further boost without taking yet more medication. before lockdown, i visited a healer, matthew manning, at his clinic in devon. wise and sympathetic, he put me into a deeply relaxed state during meditation, as he laid his hands on me, their warmth coursing through my body and making my tremors cease completely for a time.  given this impressive impact, i hope to have further sessions with him once lockdown is lifted.  some friends have also pointed to research that suggests boxing, cycling and even table tennis can be beneficial for those with parkinson’s — though, with my lumbering frame, the prospect of such vigorous activity is a little daunting.  and i draw the line at involvement with local parkinson’s support groups, one of which boasts that it offers yoga and communal singing — that’s just not me.  there may also be tambourine playing involved. i’d rather remain static on the sofa watching porridge on uk gold.  as i consider my choices, i am trying to remain stoical, not least because i despise the modern fashion for wallowing in victimhood.  after all, though there is no cure for parkinson’s, it is neither a death sentence nor particularly rare. around 145,000 british people are estimated to have it, and every hour, two new cases are diagnosed. many of those with the condition lead fulfilling, productive lives, as i intend.  as well as sustaining me with her love, elizabeth (pictured together) carries out tasks that no wife should have to do for a middle-aged husband, such as putting on my socks and tying up my shoelaces, writes leo mckinstry  i am very lucky in that my work as an author does not involve physical labour; and, though my handwriting has declined, i am still able to use a computer, as well as drive. indeed, at the very moment of my diagnosis last autumn, i had my latest book published, a dual biography of winston churchill and clement attlee.  i am often told a positive outlook is essential to coping with this condition. as an ulsterman, such optimism does not always come easily. yet i am becoming aware of some of the advantages of parkinson’s. i now have a permanent dispensation to behave as a couch potato, though as my wife says: ‘you were never exactly an olympic athlete.’  i am absolved from all chores, from cooking to cleaning. in the mornings, i can lie in late on the grounds that i ‘need a rest’.  before the covid-19 lockdown, while my wife did the supermarket shop, i often had a gentle snooze in the car. when my prescription needed picking up from the pharmacy, she went while i read the paper and poured myself another mug of tea.  i sometimes say to her: ‘i could get used to this.’ but that just illustrates what a lucky man i am in my marriage to elizabeth. beautiful, kind and funny, she has been the most wonderful support throughout this saga, supplying all the positivity i lack. her patience has been boundless, her devotion unceasing.  as well as sustaining me with her love, she carries out tasks that no wife should have to do for a middle-aged husband, such as putting on my socks and tying up my shoelaces. this september we celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, and no husband was ever more fortunate.  i have also been buoyed by the generosity of friends and family, including my two brothers and my sister-in-law. gallows humour helps, as when one colleague said to me: ‘at least you’ll be able to get your blue parking badge now.’  soon after my diagnosis, another asked me, in reference to my fondness for strong danish beer: ‘didn’t you realise that carlsberg special is not a health supplement?’  perhaps even more surprising has been the kindness people have shown me as i hobble my clumsy, restricted way through life.  during the pandemic, i have had to isolate myself because of my condition, but i have been helped by the local town council, where volunteers deliver groceries or medication for vulnerable people.  in the same manner, one kindly neighbour went to the butcher’s for me, another to the off-licence for that essential item: carlsberg beer. and that generosity matches my wider experience.  we hear so much about the cruelty and selfishness of modern british society, but i have felt the exact opposite in recent months. my vulnerability seems to bring out a spirit of benevolence.  travelling on trains and the london underground before the lockdown, seats were given up for me. in buildings, doors were opened and lifts summoned. when i dropped my change in a shop recently, the assistant rushed from behind her counter to pick it up.  in the same way, i have only praise for the medical profession. from professor hanna to my gp, from pharmacists to nursing assistants, i have been shown expertise mixed with compassion.  the covid-19 crisis has become the nhs’s shining hour, inspiring deserved adulation. yet in my experience, even before the emergency it functioned well and maintained its humane principles. indeed, experts tell me that, because of the standards of care, there is no better country in the world to have parkinson’s than britain.  i don’t know what the future will hold for me. professor hanna says that any benefits of the drugs are likely to wear off in ten years as the disease accelerates, leaving me severely disabled.  on the other hand, given the remarkable advances in medical technology, there may be a cure for parkinson’s by then — so all hope for the long term is not yet lost."
health,"i have impacted wisdom teeth and recently had one removed because it caused an infection. i also started having heart palpitations, which went away when i was taking antibiotics for the infection but came back after i finished them. my breathing is laboured, too. is this connected to my tooth infection?  sav huntington, by email.  heart palpitations are defined as an awareness of forceful, rapid or irregular heartbeats. although they may feel significant, their root cause is often innocent. mostly palpitations are due to extra systoles, or heartbeats, which occur in all of us at times and are more common when we are under stress or drink excess caffeine, for example.  now that your symptoms are occurring with breathlessness you do need further investigation, as this can happen when there is an underlying issue, such as a heart rhythm problem.  there are any number of possible causes, and without knowing about your medical history, age, current medication and other symptoms, it would be misleading to speculate whether or not there is a connection with your tooth infection.  dental infections are usually localised to the jaw and soft tissues. but there are occasions when infection can spread elsewhere in the body, including to the heart, writes dr martin scurr (stock image)  dental infections — such as your recent wisdom tooth problem — are usually localised to the jaw and soft tissues. but there are occasions when infection can spread elsewhere in the body, including to the heart.  endocarditis — when bacteria travelling in the bloodstream alight on one or more of the heart valves, causing infection there — can be secondary to a dental infection.  the condition usually develops gradually over weeks and you may experience fatigue, sweats, flu-like symptoms and, eventually, shortness of breath and palpitations. however, although there is a potential distant connection between palpitations and your recent dental problem, the most important point is that your heart symptoms should be investigated.  your gp will carry out an electrocardiogram (ecg) to record the electrical activity of the heart, which should then identify any abnormal rhythm.  if there are no palpitations at the time of the tracing, you might be offered a 24-hour continuous ecg (often known as a holter monitor), or referred for an echocardiogram (an ultrasound scan of the heart).  it is most likely that these investigations will be achieved by referral to the cardiology department of your local hospital. the cause is undoubtedly treatable.  in short, the task is a quest for an exact diagnosis."
health,"six weeks was how long it took me to finally see a doctor. six weeks since i’d first discovered a painful lump in my left breast, on a work trip to costa rica before lockdown.  why did i leave it so long? after all, most people who find a lump think of one thing — cancer. but these are strange times.  i check my breasts for lumps regularly, lifting my arms, feeling into the armpits, checking the skin for any changes or discomfort, and on my own in a hotel room back in march, i came across the ‘anything unusual’ we’re warned about.  the lump was on the underside of my breast and, when i probed it beneath my fingertips, it was sore.  six weeks was how long it took me to finally see a doctor. six weeks since i’d first discovered a painful lump in my left breast, on a work trip to costa rica before lockdown, writes julia bradbury  i wasn’t unduly frightened at first. i’m 49 and i’ve had three children, all breast-fed (which is said to lower the cancer risk), and there isn’t a history of breast cancer in my family.  trying not to panic, i discussed it over the phone with my friend, kate, who reassured me that on its own, pain usually isn’t cancer — although on occasion the pain made me wince, and i had the lump, too.  i decided to try to put it out of my mind, but thought: ‘i must go and see a doctor about that when i get home,’ which would be in ten days’ time.  however, my kids are still young (twin girls aged five and an eight-year-old boy) and when i got back from my trip, they ambushed me at the door and stuck to me like glue for the first few days.  then another project came in. then my parents came to stay. then we had parents’ evenings to schedule. then covid swept across the country. lockdown.  the former countryfile presenter (second right) with (left to right) matt baker, john craven, prince charles and adam henson in 2013  watching images every evening on the news of brave nhs staff strained under the pressure of this viral phenomenon made me feel awkward — guilty, even — about seeking reassurance over a lump i kept telling myself ‘was nothing’.  in the back of my mind was also the thought that the last place i wanted to go was a hospital rife with coronavirus.  it’s a dilemma many others are going through. the number of people seeking a gp appointment has plummeted by more than 25 per cent during lockdown, according to nhs data. ‘worryingly quiet,’ is how my gp described the situation in his surgery.  and that has a knock-on effect. cancer research uk says urgent referrals have dropped by around 75 per cent during the pandemic.  it’s heartbreaking to think that there are thousands — maybe more — who are putting their health at risk by not seeking help now. and i could have been one of them.  five weeks after my return to the uk, i was still putting off doing anything about the lump, despite an intermittent dull ache.  then a friend told me she was having surgery that night for breast cancer. i was devastated. it was out of the blue. i didn’t want her to have to go through this, especially during peak coronavirus outbreak.  i check my breasts for lumps regularly, lifting my arms, feeling into the armpits, checking the skin for any changes or discomfort, and on my own in a hotel room back in march, i came across the ‘anything unusual’ we’re warned about, writes julia bradbury  it was the jolt i needed. i realised this could happen to me, and doing nothing wasn’t helping anyone.  there are around 55,000 new diagnoses of breast cancer a year. and the coronavirus doesn’t stop that. what’s more, if i did have cancer then my chances would be dramatically better if i got treatment sooner rather than later.  so the day after i spoke to my friend, i had a zoom appointment with my gp, whom i’ve known for 30 years. he didn’t ask to see my breasts because a) that would have been weird, and b) we agreed that he wouldn’t be able to see much — my gristly sore bit wasn’t visible.  because it had been there for several weeks, he referred me straight away to a private breast cancer specialist who was still working during the pandemic — many are not. ‘you’ve done the right thing,’ my gp assured me. he said that if you find a lump, experience nipple discharge or you notice ‘contour difference’, then you must do something. all these symptoms need to be investigated further.  a special referral pathway is in place to ensure you’re seen within two weeks — whether or not you have private health insurance.  video-conferencing with my doctor was strange. this man has seen me through endometriosis surgery, three births, a miscarriage and a triple hernia operation. but now we were communicating via a screen. it felt weirdly impersonal, given how ‘hands on’ our meetings normally are.  his parting words were: ‘don’t worry, it’s probably nothing.’  three days later, i was stepping over the threshold of a clinic in london. a trio of face masks greeted me from behind a glass reception booth. this was the first time i’d left my home since lockdown, and i was feeling quite strange. and nervous.  they handed me a clipboard, which i accepted gingerly. ‘no thanks, i don’t need a pen.’ i put down my bag on a waiting-room chair and instantly regretted it.  as i reached to get my sanitised pen, i accidentally pulled the face mask i had in my bag — carefully wrapped in a tissue — out on to the floor. this wasn’t going well.  while he was inspecting me, mr gui told me that he had picked up something in the mammogram, but there was nothing to be concerned about. phew! weeks of stress slipped off my shoulders, writes julia bradbury  i was told to go to the eighth floor, but i looked at the lift, thought about the ‘viral load’ in the tiny space, and made my way up the stairs, instead.  this was my first mammogram and i’d been told by friends to expect extreme discomfort. it’s basically like photocopying your breasts. they get flattened individually between two hard plates so doctors can capture an image of what’s going on with your tissue.  it was over within five minutes. the masked nurse left the room to show the doctor the images. then she came back in and said the doctor wanted more images of my right breast. this sent a little shock through me because the pain and the lump was in the left.  social media myth buster we debunk the covid-19 hoaxes circulating online. this week: foods that can protect against the coronavirus. numerous posts online advise using homemade remedies to protect against covid-19, including eating garlic, lemon, ginger, broccoli and asparagus. ‘this type of story makes me so frustrated because none of these foods have been subjected to proper trials to test their medicinal properties,’ says dr bharat pankhania, a clinical lecturer in public health medicine at the university of exeter medical school. ‘the same goes for any home remedies doing the rounds — including dangerous suggestions such as making your own remedy with bleach, which could be fatal,’ adds gp professor steve cox. numerous posts online advise using homemade remedies to protect against covid-19, including eating garlic, lemon, ginger, broccoli and asparagus ‘there is currently nothing proven to protect you from the virus, apart from not coming into contact with it and regular hand-washing.’ advertisement  the consultant, breast surgeon gerald gui (who also works in the nhs) has a comforting air of efficiency about him. he became the third person to handle my breasts in an hour. i know some people might find this process excruciating, but i’ve never been shy or embarrassed about nakedness.  while he was inspecting me, mr gui told me that he had picked up something in the mammogram, but there was nothing to be concerned about. phew! weeks of stress slipped off my shoulders.  ‘you have clustered microcysts — mini cysts — in your left breast, fairly common for your age group, and that’s what you can feel,’ he told me. ‘the majority of lumps that women find turn out to be benign.’  no treatment was needed — he simply urged me to have the usual breast screening. i wanted to shake his hand — the relief was now coursing through my body.  back home, i took off all my clothes at the door and put them straight in the washing machine. everything you do during covid-19 life is complicated.  but i realised i had potentially made my life even more complicated by not seeking help sooner. i had gone through all those weeks of worry and stress for nothing.  my children ran up to me screaming: ‘mummy, mummy! we’ve got a pet slug!’ i hugged them all hard and felt that release again.  when i got to my bedroom, i cried. big, emotional tears. i suppose i was just decompressing.  if you’re reading this and you have found a lump, bump, or discovered a leaky nipple or a strange contour, get to your gp and don’t wait six weeks like me.  it may be nothing, in which case, why waste life worrying? and if it isn’t, then the sooner you get treatment, the better. a three-month delay can be the difference between a tumour being curable or not.  my lovely friend has had her mastectomy. she was in and out of hospital in a day, remarkably, but now comes the challenging part in a covid-19 world — recovery with no hugs."
health,"whatever happened to the family health encyclopaedia – that doorstep-sized tome everyone had on their bookshelves that listed just about every ailment you and your kids were ever likely to have, and how to treat them?  they were written by teams of doctors, and put out by the royal college of gps, the british medical association, and other trusted organisations. and they were a resource you could really rely on.  but today most are out of print and instead we go online when we get a new symptom, be it a rash, lump or bump, a horrible infection or have an accident, to ask dr google.  in fact, eight in ten people now get health information via internet search engines, and almost half of us use them to look for specific treatment advice.  i fear there will be some with serious conditions going undiagnosed, and others falling into that dr google trap, and misdiagnosing, or mistreating their ailments, writes dr ellie cannon  despite worries about cyberchondria (the name given to the anxiety caused by self-diagnosing problems via search engines) and fake health news, i think the internet has on the whole had an astonishingly positive impact on public health.  with a few strokes of a keyboard, patients can arm themselves with up-to-date health advice, and the latest medical research. this can be empowering – and liberating. but there are pitfalls, too. a study published earlier this month found that search engines give an ‘inaccurate diagnosis’ about a third of the time.  and that’s unfortunate, given that easy access to reputable health advice is more important than ever right now.  as i wrote last week, gp services are very much open for business, and have been throughout the crisis.  of course, things are different. the majority of our appointments are now via video calls, and prescriptions are filled out online.  i have been among the first to criticise the relentless march to ‘digitising’ healthcare, as i feared it would leave many of my older, or more vulnerable patients behind.  but in fact, they’ve been the most avid adopters of these changes – and are delighted that they can now get appointments the next day, on the comfort of their own sofa, rather than wait weeks to then sit for hours in a crowded waiting room.  specialist services such as skin clinics and physiotherapy are suspended, and there is a pause on screenings for cervical, breast and prostate cancer.  gp services are very much open for business, and have been throughout the crisis (file photo of a doctor working in the office and listening to a patient)  however, we are still monitoring patients on the blood-thinning drug warfarin, reviewing sick children and seeing patients with extreme stomach pains.  and we’re still providing face- to-face appointments for those who cannot access video consultations or with urgent complaints.  despite this, though, numbers contacting gps are down across the uk. surveys suggest that many people are reluctant to ‘bother’ their doctor and use up valuable nhs resources.  this is, of course, a worry, as i fear there will be some with serious conditions going undiagnosed, and also others falling into that dr google trap, and misdiagnosing, or mistreating their ailments.  and, with this mind – if you won’t, or can’t, go to the gp – i’ll bring the gp to you.  over the following eight pages, you’ll find my vital guide to coping with all of your family’s health problems at home.  routine health checks aren’t happening right now, making it more important than ever to ensure that you’re in good health (file photo of an elderly woman checking her blood pressure)  this includes answers to 50 questions i’m most often asked in clinic – from how to handle bad backs and sore knees, to spotting the symptoms of a chest infection, treatments for painful headaches and eye problems.  in case you are faced with an emergency, we’ve included an easy-to-follow basic first aid guide, which includes up-to-date advice for minimising covid-19 risk, should it be someone outside of your family that you’re attending to.  and, as routine health checks aren’t happening right now, making it more important than ever to ensure that you’re in good health, we’ve provided a guide to giving yourself a full-body mot.  consider this package your very own family health encyclopaedia – an invaluable resource that’ll safeguard your health, and the health of your loved ones.  at a time when nhs provisions may seem sporadic, it’s vital for every patient to know what they can do to help themselves – and of course, when it’s time to seek help…  headaches and other painful problems  it’s worth knowing that dehydration and stress are both very common headache triggers (pictured: illustration of a person with a headache)  1. is it safe to take painkillers every day for a headache – and what’s the best type?  headaches have many causes – and often they’re surprising. headaches in the morning can be a result of jaw-clenching and tooth-grinding while we sleep. both of these are a result of stress.  dehydration is another culprit, and if the headache is worse when bending forwards, it may indicate a sinus infection.  it is safe to take painkillers for a few days, but if you need them every day for a week or longer, you should speak to your doctor and try to work out what’s behind the problem.  painkillers every day can actually worsen the problem – a condition called medication-overuse headache.  alternate between paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin, and try resting without any painkillers, to avoid making things worse.  ibuprofen and aspirin can irritate the stomach, so if you are taking them regularly, ensure it is with meals.  it’s worth knowing that dehydration and stress are both very common headache triggers.  2. can i take ibuprofen and paracetamol together for my arthritis pain?  paracetamol and ibuprofen can be safely taken together.  the usual daily dose for paracetamol is 1g (two tablets) four times a day. for ibuprofen, it is 400mg (usually two tablets) three times a day with food for an otherwise healthy adult.  paracetamol and ibuprofen can be safely taken together. the usual dose for paracetamol is 1g (two tablets) four times a day (pictured: file photo of paracetamol tablets)  combining medications is a sensible way to control pain, and taking them regularly when you have a flare-up is a good way to keep moving, which is also vital.  alongside painkillers, applying ice to joints is a great way to ease the pain, particularly if they are swollen as well, as is using rub-in treatments from the chemist.  3. i have awful toothache, but the dentist is closed. what should i do?  toothache will usually go within a few days with no treatment. take regular painkillers for a few days and ensure strict dental hygiene with chlorhexidine mouthwash and regular brushing. ibuprofen or aspirin are good for dental pain.  at the moment, dental services are available via 111: the dentist can consult on the phone or via video. they may be able to prescribe and treat you remotely.  4. i keep getting random nosebleeds. what’s the best way to stop them?  most nosebleeds are not a sign of anything serious and can be treated at home. sit down, and pinch your nose, just above the nostrils and hold for ten minutes. try to lean forward while doing this, to stop the blood draining back into your throat.  once the bleeding has stopped, stay upright – don’t lie down, as this will increase the blood pressure inside your nose – and put a bag of frozen peas on the bridge of your nose. this causes the blood vessels in the nose to contract, preventing another bleed.  the lining of the centre of the nose is fragile and can break and bleed, particularly with nose-blowing, dry rooms or if you take blood-thinners. often new nosebleeds are caused by an infection in the lining of the nose. an antibiotic cream on prescription is needed to treat that. if they are happening regularly, talk to your doctor. it is rare, but they can be a result of high blood pressure, so it is worth taking your blood pressure at home.  5. what cream should i put on a painful burn? none. if your burn is mild enough to be treated at home, you shouldn’t need to use a cream, as they can cause your skin to become irritated – not what you want in addition to the burn. just run the burn under cool water for 20 minutes, then cover with clingfilm to keep it clean. don’t wrap it, as this can constrict the burn and that’ll hurt more. run the burn under cool water for 20 minutes, then cover with clingfilm to keep it clean you can keep the clingfilm in place with a bandage. to deal with any pain, you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen. most minor burns heal with minimal scarring within one to two weeks. do not burst any blisters. advertisement  coughs, colds and how to tackle a fever  6. how long does it take to recover from a cough or cold, and when do you need antibiotics?  at the moment, any new cough, high temperature or loss of sense of smell should be treated as a warning sign for coronavirus, and the advice is to self-isolate for seven days, or longer if symptoms persist.  patients should also go to the nhs 111 website, as a covid-19 test might be indicated. but in general, one of the most (if not the most) common thing i see in clinic is someone concerned that a cough, runny nose and excess phlegm have not cleared up after two weeks. a bad upper respiratory tract infection will often take two weeks or more to clear, and for a patient to feel back to normal.  in any case, antibiotics are rarely prescribed. these drugs kill off bacterial infections, not the viral ones responsible for most coughs and colds.  instead, ask your pharmacist for advice about effective cough medicine – detailing whether your cough is dry or mucus-heavy. otherwise, the best remedies are boring but effective: ample rest and plenty of fluids. but if you begin to have difficulty breathing, call your doctor. very occasionally a lingering cough indicates an underlying condition or secondary infection, so call the gp if you’re still coughing after three weeks, just in case.  7. what colour is your mucus if you have a chest infection?  forget the widely held belief that green phlegm means you need antibiotics. a change in mucus colour tells you nothing about your infection – unless you have chronic lung disease. it simply means the immune system is fighting the infection by deploying plenty of fighter cells, which range in colour.  the only way to diagnose a chest infection is via a gp examination or a chest x-ray. blood or a brown stain in the mucus could indicate a serious infection, as well as other problems. if you have a stain this colour, call your gp.  8. i don't have a thermometer. how can i tell if i have a fever – and what should i do about it?  if your forehead is hot to the touch, or if you have rosy, flushed cheeks and a faster-than-normal pulse, these are signs that you have a high temperature. it’s your body’s response to common infections, including a flu, tonsillitis, urinary tract infections and, of course, coronavirus.  obviously, these will also come alongside feeling generally unwell: fatigued and not yourself.  having said that, it’s a really good idea to have a thermometer – especially now, as a persistent high temperature can be a warning sign that covid-19 is not getting better. choose a digital one, as these are more accurate. most fevers – a temperature of more than 37c – subside after a few days. rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol or ibuprofen are the main treatments. symptoms that worsen, or new ones developing, are signs you should seek help.  child fevers and tummy troubles 9. what's the best way to deal with my toddler’s fevers? having a distressed child with a fever can be extremely worrying. but it is a common problem and, in most cases, it is not serious. my first advice is: don’t panic. most children will have high temperatures – over 37.5c – three times a year. and the fever may persist, even for a few days. if the child seems happy and they are drinking enough fluid to keep hydrated, it’s likely they’ll be fine. most children will have high temperatures – over 37.5c – three times a year the main treatment would be a liquid paracetamol to bring the temperature down but that’s not essential. so how do you know if it’s morphed into something more serious? watch how often they drink and go to the toilet. if they’re not drinking or passing urine and are more drowsy or floppy, call nhs 111 – this could be more serious. other red flags include headaches accompanied by pale, cold or mottled skin, a dislike of bright lights and irritability. these could indicate meningitis. parents often think a rash that does not disappear if a glass is rolled over it is the main sign for meningitis – but by the time this occurs, the infection may already be quite advanced. and what about dreaded stomach pains? typically, the problem is constipation and related to diet. add in plenty of water or fruit juice, lots of dried fruit and wholemeal bread to get them moving. less common are occasional bouts of diarrhoea, which you should keep an eye on. keep a food diary for a couple of weeks to watch for any triggers. rarely, the stomach pain is paired with weight loss, a swollen belly, poor appetite or persistent diarrhoea – in these cases, call your gp. if the pain is sudden and moves from the centre to the right, call nhs 111 – this is the telltale sign of appendicitis.  10. what is the best way to manage vomiting in adults?  the most common cause of vomiting in adults is a stomach bug, that will be either bacterial or viral.  it usually stops after one or two days. drink small amounts of clear fluid, or rehydration fluids, which can be purchased from a pharmacist.  once the vomiting has stopped, after about 12 hours, try some bland food such as a dry, plain biscuit or toast. vomiting bugs can be infectious, so make sure you thoroughly clean all areas that have been in contact with vomit.  11. what should i eat to settle nausea? ginger is a known anti-sickness remedy, so you could try sipping ginger tea and taking small bites of ginger biscuits.  everyone in your household should also be extra-careful about hygiene and hand-washing. vomiting can be a sign of something serious such as meningitis, and if a vomiting lasts for more than an hour, and doesn’t provide relief, or is accompanied by severe headache, call your gp.  12. what do i do about tonsillitis?  tonsillitis, an infection in the throat, is pretty easy to spot – look for the telltale white spots on the two fleshy nodules at either side of the back of the throat. these nodules, the tonsils, are bright red when infected. it might be painful to swallow, and you’ll probably have a fever too.  paracetamol or ibuprofen will help manage the pain, and gargling with salt water – a natural anti-inflammatory – will help.  gargling for three to four minutes with soluble aspirin can also provide relief and can be used alongside other painkillers, but take care not to swallow it.  if tonsillitis persists, then the antibiotic penicillin may be prescribed.  13. how often should i update my asthma inhaler prescription?  make sure you’re using the inhaler properly – helpful videos can be found on the asthma uk website (file photo of a ventolin inhaler)  symptoms are the best guide to the strength of medication you need. if you’re using a blue inhaler every day – for immediate relief from symptoms – it’s probably time for an update. this is also true if you can’t exercise for as long as usual without getting breathless.  but before you make any changes, make sure you’re using the inhaler properly – helpful videos can be found on the asthma uk website.  14. i take an antihistamine tablet every day for my hay fever. is this safe?  patients don’t believe me when i tell them they can take antihistamines every day of the year.  for those with severe hay fever and other allergies that are active all year round, these daily tablets can be a life-saver.  if one stops working, switch to another over-the-counter type – the pharmacist can help with this. i’d also recommend buying a saline nose spray from your local pharmacy, as it washes away pollen.  achy joints, bad backs and broken bones  15. my knee is in agony! is it because i’ve started jogging or could it be something serious?  knee pain is common – and there are a range of causes. it can be related to an injury, including damage to the soft tissues within and around the joint, which is easy to do when throwing yourself into a new exercise regime.  this kind of pain is frequently one-sided.  often, it’s minor. rest and using a cool compress – an ice pack or bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel – will help. try to keep your bad knee elevated, as this means the circulation won’t have to work against gravity, meaning swelling will be minimised.  intense pain on movement, or when resting, instability and swelling that doesn’t go away with a few days of rest might indicate a problem that needs medical attention.  knee pain can also be a symptom of osteoarthritis, but this is more often in both knees, and will usually be worse in the morning.  this is also common, from middle age onwards, and can be tricky to treat – excess weight is a big exacerbating factor, so weight loss and, paradoxically, keeping as active as possible are the best ways to reduce pain.  16. i can't move my right shoulder, it’s too painful. what have i done?  this is what’s known as a frozen shoulder: it’ll be painful all the time and stiff, particularly if you try to reach up. it happens when the capsule around the joint becomes thickened, and tight, restricting movement.  we’re not sure why it happens, but it’s more common in those over 40 and two-thirds of patients are women.  keep moving and use anti-inflammatory tablets and ice packs to relieve the pain. learn how to sit properly, not slouching and with your shoulders gently back (file photo)  diabetics are more likely to suffer a frozen shoulder – again, we don’t know why – as are those who’ve had recent arm surgery, or suffered a fracture.  physiotherapy is key. you can self-refer locally via the nhs, via your gp, or go private. you can also find correct exercises online – the charity versusarthritis.org has a comprehensive booklet on shoulder pain. keep moving and use anti-inflammatory tablets and ice packs to relieve the pain. learn how to sit properly, not slouching and with your shoulders gently back.  17. i’ve had lower back pain for two weeks now. will it ever go away?  lower back pain happens to almost everyone, and for most it resolves without medical help.  as with knee pain, and all other joint problems, it can come on after a single incident, twisting or lifting something, or just build over time.  the trick is to keep moving, so try using gentle exercises you can find online at versusarthritis.org. you have to stick at it, doing them every day for weeks, ideally even once your symptoms have gone.  if it’s bad, take painkillers regularly each day so you can move normally. immobility or moving unnaturally – what we call compensating movements – to avoid pain can make matters worse. combine that with heat packs or rubs on the area. any leg weakness, numbness or changes in your bowel or bladder are an urgent reason to seek medical help. simple back pain usually starts to improve within two to three weeks.  18. i’ve noticed my hearing is much worse in one of my ears. what’s the best way to clean them out, and could they need syringing? wax blocking the ear is a very common cause of hearing loss on one side – and can be quite annoying. never use cotton buds, which jam it in. instead, try a wax-removing drop from the pharmacist – they contain oils or hydrogen peroxide, which both soften the wax, allowing it to pass out naturally. if you've got a blocked ear, never stick anything into it.. however much you're longing to a word of warning: it may take two weeks. if it persists, the two options are ear irrigation, a newer, safer version of syringing, which involved a machine, or microsuction, which gently sucks out the wax. not all gps offer these, so you may have to go private.  19. i've twisted my ankle and can barely walk. what shall i do?  twisting an ankle pulls the ligaments in the joint, damaging them, and resulting in pain and swelling.  the answer is rest, ice, compression and elevation.  rest as much as you can with little or no weight being put on the joint. ice the joint with frozen peas or an ice pack for 15 minutes four times a day. compress it with a bandage from the pharmacy to support it. as much as you can, keep it elevated to reduce swelling.  paracetamol is best for pain in the first few days after a twist.  20. why am i getting leg cramps at night?  leg cramps are normally harmless, and we often don’t find a reason for them. stretching exercises for calf muscles can help to prevent them – good instructions are available online at nhs.uk.  leg cramps can down to ageing, too little or too much exercise or dehydration. ensuring that you are drinking enough water is a good idea.  cramps can also be a side effect of medication – particularly water tablets (diuretics) given for heart disease, and statins.  leg cramps are normally harmless, and we often don’t find a reason for them. stretching exercises for calf muscles can help to prevent them (file photo)  21. i have a horrible feeling that i’ve broken a finger. should i tape it to the one next to it, or just leave it?  if you think you have a broken finger, you should go to a minor injuries unit or a&e. although the treatment is often to strap it to another finger to stabilise it, this works only if the bone and joint are still in line. the finger may need straightening or a cast. complex fractures can even need surgery.  sore eyes, watery eyes... and blocked ears  22. what's the best way to get rid of a stye?  a stye is a sore lump in the eyelid – normally caused by a blocked eyelash follicle or oil duct that has become infected, inflamed and, often, pus-filled.  the best treatment is a home remedy. soak a flannel in hot water and use this as a hot compress on the eyelid until it is cool. repeat two to three times, so you have heat on the stye for 20 to 30 minutes. do this three times a day.  the compress helps to gently melt and loosen the oils that are responsible for the blockage, helping the stye to drain. it can take up to a week for the stye to clear. avoid contact lenses and make-up in that time. if the swelling worsens, call a doctor straight away as it could be a sign the infection is spreading.  23. how can i tell if i have an ear infection?  ear infections are often thought of as a childhood problem, but they’re common in adults too.  symptoms include ear pain or pressure, swollen glands behind or below the ear, oozing from the ear or a temperature. they can occur following a bad cold or can be caused by water getting into the ear while swimming, or by wearing earplugs.  some ear infections can be treated with a spray from the pharmacist – but in most cases the infection will pass in a few days and paracetamol or ibuprofen will control discomfort.  24. my eyes won’t stop watering. will drops help, and which kind? we blink less when we look at screens, which leads to a drying of the eye surface strangely, watering eyes are usually dry eyes. dry eyes that water a lot are common, especially in certain environments: air-conditioning, overuse of computer screens (we blink less when we look at screens, which leads to a drying of the eye surface) and windy weather are all causes. use an artificial tears product from the pharmacist: this can be drops, gel or ointment, but gels and ointments stay in the eye longer so can be better than drops.  25. what could be causing my dizzy spells?  dizzy spells are common and can happen for a whole host of reasons. they can indicate anaemia or a problem with your heart, blood pressure or your ears. for this reason, if you have dizziness for longer than a week, speak to your doctor.  if you know your blood pressure and pulse that will be helpful to have to hand for the doctor. short-lived dizziness, particularly after a cold, is usually labyrinthitis – a viral inflammation of the balance parts of the ear. it does settle by itself and it helps to keep well hydrated and well rested.  do not drive if you feel dizzy.  26. i have lost my sense of smell but feel otherwise fine. could it be covid-19?  losing your sense of smell, which is known as anosmia, particularly when you don’t have a blocked nose, could be a sign of coronavirus, and you should isolate for seven days. you may notice a change in taste too.  you may have no other symptoms: you should still isolate and order yourself a self-test online.  it is common to lose your sense of smell for other reasons, especially with a blocked nose from sinusitis, hay fever or a cold.  rashes, flaky bits and other skin complaints  27. my hands are terribly dry and sore – i think it’s due to all the washing. what can i do?  i am seeking a lot of this at the moment, unsurprisingly. hand eczema or dermatitis is much worse with lots of hand-washing. soap and water strips away the skins natural acidity.  ask your pharmacist about a paraffin-based soap substitute or an eczema cream to use as your handwash: it cleans just as well and there are plenty to choose from.  hand eczema or dermatitis is much worse with lots of hand-washing. soap and water strips away the skins natural acidity (file photo of a woman washing her hands)  rub in paraffin-based or oat-extract cream at least four times a day, and particularly at night so it can soak into the hands. always use washing-up gloves when cleaning. detergents, soaps and wipes are very irritant to the hands.  28. i have a small patch of rough, red skin on the side of my nose that won’t go away. should i see a doctor?  the nose is a very typical place for seborrheic dermatitis – red, flaky-looking skin inflammation. it can also appear in the eyebrows, scalp and around your hairline. it is caused by a yeast overgrowth and you need a cream from the pharmacist containing clotrimazole or miconazole: they can be used safely as a long-term treatment. if it’s no better after a month, show your doctor.  29. the skin between my toes has recently started breaking up and bleeding. what creams should i buy?  this sounds like athlete’s foot, a very common fungus infection worsened by warm, damp feet. an antifungal cream, spray or powder such as miconazole from the pharmacist should get rid of it. it can take weeks to clear, so be patient.  keep your feet dry by dabbing thoroughly with a towel after washing, and wear open-toe shoes with no socks so that they don’t get sweaty. do not share towels.  30. i keep getting ulcers inside my mouth. what could be causing this – and what should i do?  mouth ulcers are little lesions that develop in the normal lining of the mouth, gums or tongue. they’re triggered by a whole range of things including damage from biting your cheek, brushing or ill-fitting dentures or dental braces, to hormonal problems – and it’s not always clear.  they normally clear up on their own within ten days and pharmacy treatments can help ease the pain: use simple painkillers or painkilling mouth gel or lozenges.  repeated ulcers usually happen as a reaction to the ingredient sls in toothpaste or from stress and overtiredness.  less commonly they can be a sign of underlying disease such as bowel disease or b12 deficiency.  always show your doctor or dentist if you have one for more than three weeks, as it could be mouth cancer.  if you’re desperate to quit smoking, now’s the perfect time to do it 31. how do i finally stop smoking – for good? there has never been a better time to quit smoking – and i’ve had a fair few patients contact me looking for help, spurred on by covid-19 worries. triggers such as pubs and the company of smoker friends are out of the equation, so there’s every chance you’ll succeed. smoking increases your chances of catching the virus by a quarter and makes you two-and-a-half times more likely to have serious complications if you do. you’re four times more likely to quit for good with support from your local nhs stop smoking service or your gp. and both services are still very much available. i’ve had a fair few patients contact me looking for help, spurred on by covid-19 worries, writes dr ellie cannon (file photo of a woman using a nicotine patch) your local stop smoking service can be found via the nhs.uk website, or a gp receptionist over the phone. it offers online support groups and telephone and video calls from healthcare practitioners. you can also use an over-the-counter aid such as nicotine gum or a patch, above. the strength of gum or patch you need depends how heavily you smoke. if it’s 20-a-day, opt for a gum containing roughly 4g of nicotine. and if you smoke within half an hour of waking up, you’ll need a patch that lasts 24 hours. another option is to take medication that stops cravings. a gp can prescribe this and send it to your local pharmacist. or you could try vaping. it’s 95 per cent safer, in terms of health risks, than normal cigarettes. you can get a vaping device easily from many stores online, and your stop smoking service adviser will be able to recommend one.  heartburn, bloating and digestive distress  32. i keep getting heartburn – what’s the best thing to deal with it?  heartburn is a burning feeling in the chest caused by stomach acid travelling up towards the throat.  also known as acid reflux, it’s common and usually not serious. consuming spicy food, chilli, coffee, alcohol and medicines such as ibuprofen, as well as smoking, are triggers.  other symptoms are an intermittent cough that keeps coming back, a hoarse voice, and bad breath.  sleeping propped up and eating smaller meals can help, as can avoiding eating in the last few hours before bed.  you can try a range of things from the pharmacist including thick alginate liquids, calcium carbonate tablets or esomeprazole.  try them in turn to see which one works, alongside avoiding the triggers.  it’s rare, but heartburn can be a sign of cancer, so if it is persisting for more than a few weeks, consult your doctor.  33. i find that i’m rushing to the loo a lot, especially after mealtimes. could i be allergic to something?  rushing to the loo is rarely a sign of a food allergy. it can be a feature of lactose intolerance, which is a reaction to the sugar in milk and dairy.  more often it’s due to what we call irritable bowel syndrome, or ibs. tummy pain and bloating are other common symptoms.  keep a diary to see what foods make it worse or make it better, as ibs typically has food triggers.  a stool test from the doctor can be done to ensure that the diarrhoea is nothing serious, such as bowel cancer.  34. i am normally regular as clockwork, but find my system is very sluggish at the moment. should i worry?  constipation is usually a reaction to changes in diet, lack of fluids or even stress or holidays. bowels can start moving with the help of plenty of water, dried fruit and plenty of fibre in the diet, along with exercise.  over-the-counter laxatives are available – some, such as senna, get the bowels moving; others, such as docusate, soften the stool. ask your pharmacist which one you need.  prolonged constipation can be a sign of ibs or thyroid disease. it is rarely a sign of serious bowel disease.  36. my nose is always running – how do i stop it? take a daily anti-histamine, which treats allergies and wash the nose our regularly with a salt water solution.  35. how long does food poisoning last, and what should i do to treat it?  most food poisoning contracted in the uk goes away with no treatment. diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea and exhaustion are all symptoms. alongside making sure you are hydrated, diarrhoea can be slowed by eating bananas, white rice and dry toast.  it usually lasts for about 48 hours but can last a week. remember to stay off work or school to protect others.  anxiety, stress and mental health issues  am i suffering from depression... and how do i stop panic attacks? (pictured: a man hiding his face behind a blue balloon with a smiley face drawn on it)  37. i am tired all the time. am i ill?  feel"
health,"problems such as high blood pressure are usually picked up at a gp surgery  do you know if your blood pressure is dangerously high? or if your blood sugar levels mean you’re on the verge of type 2 diabetes? these problems can usually be picked up during vital tests carried out at your gp surgery.  but, at present, routine screening and annual health check-ups are suspended, to allow more time to deal with acute problems and covid-19 cases. so, with heart health and diabetes being risk factors, monitoring your own health has become crucial.  with this in mind, here are the essential health checks you can do right now, from home. there’s every chance they may save your life.  at present, routine screening and annual health check-ups are suspended, to allow more time to deal with acute problems and covid-19 cases, says eve simmons  a toe tap to check your heart  how often: once a month  more than a million britons suffer a common heart rhythm problem, putting them at risk of a deadly stroke.  yet the condition, called atrial fibrillation, often goes unnoticed, with the symptoms passed off as tiredness or anxiety. but a 60-second test, completed roughly once a month, can flag-up warning signs.  sitting on a chair, put your first two fingers of one hand over your wrist on the other arm, or at the side of your neck, until you can feel your pulse. for one minute, tap your feet every time you feel your pulse beat.  if the heart rhythm is normal, toe taps will be evenly spaced. but if the tapping is irregular – very fast and then slower – it could be a sign of atrial fibrillation.  ‘if you’re tapping regularly, it’s ok, but if the tap is consistently uneven you should visit your gp,’ says dr howard marshall, a consultant cardiologist at the queen elizabeth hospital, birmingham. the doctor will do further tests and can prescribe a range of treatments.  the chair test that warns of a painful fall  how often: twice weekly to monthly  falls are the most common cause of injury-related fatality in the uk. muscle mass declines sharply as we age, causing a third of over-65s to suffer an accident every year.  health chiefs recommend twice- weekly strength-boosting activities, such as yoga or lifting weights, to prevent this. but first, find out how much exercise you can manage with a simple strength test.  more than a million britons suffer a common heart rhythm problem, putting them at risk of a deadly stroke (file photo of a woman checking her pulse)  standing with your back to a chair and feet wide apart, slowly sit down, but don’t let your bottom reach the chair. then slowly stand again. try to repeat the exercise continually for 90 seconds. if you can manage more than a minute, your strength is above average. anything under 30 seconds indicates very poor strength in the thighs and buttocks – the largest muscle groups.  if you perform poorly, practise the exercise twice weekly, or perform gentle yoga to build up strength. otherwise, over-65s should test themselves monthly, or before adopting a new exercise regime.  a pin-prick for diabetes  how often? every two to three months  with regular health checks for over-40s on hold this year, millions will miss their first warning sign of type 2 diabetes. a blood test called hba1c which measures average blood sugar levels can indicate diabetes, and prediabetes – when levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be considered diabetic.  simply prick your finger to draw blood and send off the sample, which is analysed in a laboratory (file photo)  diagnosis at this point is crucial, as lifestyle changes such as weight loss can stop the condition progressing. home hba1c tests available online are almost identical to the one carried out by the gp.  for a kit, go to a reputable pharmacist, or try monitormyhealth.org.uk, which is nhs-backed.  simply prick your finger to draw blood and send off the sample, which is analysed in a laboratory.  the measurement used is mmol/mol. anything below 42mmol/mol is considered normal.  if you have no other symptoms but score highly, repeat the test once a month for three months to see if you get the same result.  regardless of the test, if you have telltale symptoms of diabetes, such as feeling constantly thirsty and going to the toilet more than usual, tiredness, blurred vision and thrush, call your gp.  take a life-saving picture  how often: every two months  no one knows your skin better than you do. that’s why self-checking is the best way to spot the suspicious changes in moles that might indicate skin cancer.  if you have more than 20 moles on one arm, you may be at a higher risk of developing melanoma – the deadliest form of skin cancer – according to scientists at king’s college london.  while there are hundreds of smartphone apps that claim to track and monitor skin changes, dermatologist justine hextall suggests taking pictures of high-risk areas, and reviewing them every two months.  use the dermatologist-recommended abcde rule to help you spot something worrying.  if you have more than 20 moles on one arm, you may be at a higher risk of developing melanoma (file photo of a big skin mole that should be inspected by a dermatologist)  watch for a: asymmetrical shape, b: borders that are jagged, c: colour change, d: diameter above 6mm and e: evolution from its regular appearance.  if you notice any of the above, or bleeding or itching, call the gp immediately.  non-melanomas are far less risky and don’t develop from a mole, but spread occasionally. these usually appear as a bump that is red, cracked, blistered and spot-like.  the vital checks you should never stop doing  life-saving screenings for bowel, cervical and breast cancer are now delayed – potentially denying millions that crucial, early diagnosis. so spotting your own lumps and bumps is more important than ever. but this doesn’t mean doing a specific test monthly – or even every week.  instead, experts advise touching and examining your body as regularly as possible, such as in the shower. this helps you get to grips with your ‘normal’, so you are more likely to notice abnormalities.  get used to how breast tissue feels and looks at different times of the month. if you notice any change in the breast or nipple shape, size or sensation, call your gp.  a similar approach applies to the size and shape of the testicles.  look out for blood in the loo, as changes in bowel habits can be a warning sign for bowel cancer. it’s important you flag this up with a doctor as soon as you notice it."
health,"f you are in any doubt or concerned that someone is seriously unwell, call 999  in an emergency, dr lynn thomas says: ‘doing something is better than nothing'  make sure it is safe to help, before checking if casualty is conscious or breathing  confronted with an emergency, would you know what to do? alarmingly, research suggests that 40 per cent of people in the uk would be worried about intervening to give first aid. but it needn’t be scary.  in fact, arming yourself with even the most basic knowledge – outlined here – could prove to be the difference between life and death. dr lynn thomas, medical director of st john ambulance, says: ‘everyone should know what to do if someone is choking or if somebody collapses in front of you and their heart has stopped.  ‘if you know what to do before something happens, it makes it easier to do it, if you are faced with an emergency.’  research suggests that 40 per cent of people in the uk would be worried about intervening to give first aid (pictured: process or rewinding index finger to hand with a medical bandage)  before helping a casualty, make sure it is safe to do so.  then check if they are conscious or breathing, as this will inform your next steps.  if you are in any doubt or concerned that someone is seriously unwell, you must call 999.  but most importantly, don’t panic. ‘doing something is better than

above the belly button. clench one fist and grasp it with your other hand. pull sharply – and upwards – five times. check their mouth each time.  3. call 999 if this fails. continue giving five sharp blows followed by five sharp pulls. start cpr if the person becomes unresponsive.  what every first aid kit needs  keep a first aid kit at home and in your car.  you can buy one for under £20. alternatively, make up your own and keep it in a sealed container.  here's a list of the most essential items...  wound dressings: dressing pads can be used to apply pressure to stop bleeding.  adhesive dressings or plasters: for cuts and grazes. keep a few in different sizes.  roller bandages: to support injured joints, maintain pressure on wounds and secure dressings.  triangular bandages: can be folded to make bandages or slings.  elasticated tubular bandages: to support injured elbows and knees.  cleansing wipes: to clean around cuts before dressing.  disposable gloves and a mask: to prevent infection.  adhesive tape: to secure dressings and bandages.  scissors: to cut bandages and tape.  safety pins: for loose ends of bandages.  caring for a broken bone  1. use your hands to

health,"a coronavirus vaccine trialled in 108 healthy volunteers in china safely triggered an immune response in the participants, a new study reveals.  antibody production seen in the patients is a good sign that the vaccine may protect them from infection, but it's too soon to say for sure.  the chinese vaccine, made by cansino, was the very first shot to enter clinical trials earlier this year - months ahead of human testing for the uk's lead candidate jab - made by oxford university - or the american top-contender, made by biotech moderna.  most of the people dosed with the vaccine had immune responses, although their levels of antibodies thought to neutralize the virus were relatively low. researchers saw a stronger ramp-up of other immune compounds, called t-cells, that might also help fight the infection off.  there were side effects - primarily pain, muscle aches and fever - but they subsided within 28 days, and no serious or dangerous side effects were reported.  promising results from the completed first human trial china's ad5 coronavirus vaccine place it at the front of the global race for a shot, though only by a slim margin, an expert told dailymail.com.  it's not yet clear whether the shot - if it proves effective - will be available in the us, and the department of health and human services had not responded to request for comment at the time of publication.  chinese researchers have become the first to complete a human trial for a coronavirus vaccine, which was safe and triggered an immune response in participants, but a us expert worries the shot didn't produce enough 'neutralizing' antibodies to block infection (file)  the study, conducted by collaborating universities and local cdc's in china, recruited 108 patients ranging in age from 18 to 60, and split them into three groups the received, respectively, low, middle and high doses of the vaccine  at the study's start, none of the patients - who had never been infected with coronavirus - had neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19.  within two weeks, participants in all three dosage groups had 'rapid binding antibody responses,' meaning they showed signs that they were making antibodies capable of fighting coronavirus infection.  levels of neutralizing antibodies - a type of immune cell that binds to a virus and may be able to completely block infection - were closely monitored too.  by the second week after vaccination, everyone had moderate increase in these important immune cells.  participants blood levels of neutralizing antibodies reached their peak by the 28th day after they were injected.  levels of these antibodies were more than twice as high among the participants who got the high dose shot, compared to those given the low dose.  while any increase in neutralizing antibodies was a significant gain over the subjects' starting levels (zero), dr peter hotez, a vaccine expert at baylor college of medicine in texas, was unimpressed with the levels produced in the trial participants.  'the one thing not we're not seeing is a really high neutralizing antibody titer,' he told dailymail.com.  'the question is whether we’re going to need that and whether these vaccines will be adequate to stimulate an immune response.'  patients in the trial did have more robust increases in their levels of t cells, immune cells that perform a search and destroy function, rather than the blocking work done by neutralizing antibodies.  more studies will be needed to determine whether the vaccine can protect against infection in practice.  encouragingly, none of the 108 patients had serious side effects.  more than 80 percent did have some side effects, but these were mostly mild or moderate, like muscle aches, fever and pain. most subsided within a couple of weeks, and almost all resolved by the end of the study.  five patients given the high dose had high-grade fevers, but these, too, broke and came down within a couple of days.  moderna is working closely with the nih to develop its vaccine, and is leading the us race  the us government has placed an order for 300 million doses of astrazeneca's shot, developed with oxford university  'that's pretty good,' dr hotez says.  side effect profiles may be particularly important to getting people to get vaccinated against coronavirus once one is available.  a  poll published thursday found that a quarter of americans were not very or not at all interested in getting a vaccine for the virus that has infected more than 1.6 million people in the us.  many of them said they were concerned the vaccine would be riskier than the disease itself because development is moving so fast.  so far, the us government is supporting the development of 14 candidate vaccinations through its operation speed initiative.  it's unclear if the us is coordinating with the chinese vaccine developers.  in the us and uk, vaccines from moderna and oxford university (collaborating with astazeneca) are in human trials, and have shown promising early results.  china's completed trial puts it ahead - but not by much, says dr hotez. he says that all of the vaccines will need to go through large, phase iii trials before they become available, bringing their timelines close together."
health,"yes, it was the perfect slogan: ‘stay home, protect the nhs, save lives’. too perfect, perhaps?  the government’s lockdown campaign has worked so well that not only did it stop the health service from being overwhelmed by coronavirus victims, it has also seen infection and death rates plummet.  a significant number of hospital trusts — including six in london, which has been a viral hotspot — are reported to have gone 48 hours without any covid-19 deaths this week.  it’s no longer coronavirus that’s at risk of sweeping the nation, leaving death and economic destruction in its wake, but what’s being dubbed ‘coronachondria’ — an irrational fear of the virus [file photo]  but an aggressive lockdown does not come without psychological consequences for the population. now ministers are faced with the problem of persuading millions to come out of lockdown.  some, of course, are enjoying this period as a bonus holiday at home — especially if they are still being paid or have been furloughed — or, as we have seen, flocking to beaches and beauty spots to enjoy the sunshine.  many, however, are simply terrified of getting infected. it’s no longer coronavirus that’s at risk of sweeping the nation, leaving death and economic destruction in its wake, but what’s being dubbed ‘coronachondria’ — an irrational fear of the virus.  a study by cambridge university, published earlier this month, has found britons are more scared of the virus than other nationalities.  indeed, i believe many of us have become so hysterical that we’ve lost all sense of perspective about the risks — not least the bosses of the teaching unions.  they blithely ignore the disruption caused to the education of youngsters, and the potentially devastating consequences to their future prospects.  instead, they have produced a list of 169 demands — on issues such as bin lids, coronavirus counselling and extra staff to clean paint brushes, scissors and glue sticks — that must be dealt with before teachers will consider returning to their jobs.  yes, it was the perfect slogan: ‘stay home, protect the nhs, save lives’. too perfect, perhaps? a businesswoman is seen using video conferencing software at home in a stock image [file photo]  at the other end of the spectrum, we have people in dire need of medical advice or treatment who are too anxious to go to a local surgery or a&e, or even turn up for scheduled hospital appointments, for fear they will be struck down by covid-19.  i’ve had numerous patients in this situation — including one in the throes of a heart attack who refused to be taken to hospital.  during a chat with another patient recently, she told me she was worried about her son, an eight-year-old with asthma and a rash across his torso.  i feared the rash could have been a symptom of meningitis, which demands urgent intervention, and told her to take him to a&e immediately. she wouldn’t, as her fears about covid-19 outweighed any concern about a potentially fatal brain infection!  this is madness. i’m not suggesting there aren’t valid reasons to be concerned about the coronavirus pandemic. so far, more than 36,000 people have died with this disease in the uk. but we — and i mean politicians, scientists and doctors — need to start putting the mortality statistics in context for the public.  indeed, i believe many of us have become so hysterical that we’ve lost all sense of perspective about the risks — not least the bosses of the teaching unions. they blithely ignore the disruption caused to the education of youngsters, and the potentially devastating consequences to their future prospects [file photo]  for the vast majority of people, this infection is mild. every death is, of course, a tragedy, but most of those who have died were in the high-risk category by virtue of their age (80 plus) or because of underlying health problems.  death rates among those under 40 are less than one per cent, while children are at minimal risk of infection or transmission.  those who are vulnerable must take precautions and shelter themselves, but the rest of us cannot give in to a fear that has no basis in what we now know about the virus.  last month, this paper reported that up to 150,000 brits could die from non-coronavirus causes because of lockdown, by failing to seek medical help when they need it, or due to the consequences of the economic crisis we face unless britain gets back to work.  the prime minister has reportedly made an observation to colleagues along the lines of: ‘it’s far easier to take people’s freedoms away than persuade them to take them back’. he wasn’t wrong.  we will never have a guaranteed zero risk of infection — it’s crazy to think that’s a possibility. and what about all the other risks we happily take every day? for example, there were 1,870 road deaths last year, but that hasn’t stopped most people driving.  it’s time to get the country back on its feet, while maintaining social distancing and regular hand-washing — and protecting the most vulnerable.  it’s natural to be afraid, but we cannot let fear control us. we will most likely be living with this virus for a long time, so for all our sakes, let’s get back to some common sense normality.  scandal of care home victims  there is no doubt that mistakes have been made by this government in response to the coronavirus.  whether it was the dire shortage of ppe for frontline workers or an abysmal testing policy or the timing of the lockdown, questions must be asked and people held to account.  but the greatest failing — criminal, even — is what was allowed to unfold in our care homes. it is unforgiveable, and for this both ministers and the nhs must apologise.  boris johnson insists he called for the lockdown in care homes before the general lockdown on march 23. this is not true.  hospitals, under pressure to clear beds, were continuing to discharge patients with covid-19 back to care homes. this fuelled the pandemic, leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths.  i am heartened by the prime minister’s newfound comittment to solving the problem of long-term social care but not yet persuaded he’ll deliver.  whether it was the dire shortage of ppe for frontline workers or an abysmal testing policy or the timing of the lockdown, questions must be asked and people held to account [file photo]  history lessons  our society likes to think it knows better than our forebears. but there’s a thing or two we can learn from them.  for centuries, ‘fever hospitals’ were the safest way of caring for those with infectious diseases such as cholera, typhus and tb.  isolating infected patients in one place reduced the risk of spread to other patients.  now scientist richard hobday is calling for their return and if, as many epidemiologists predict, the emergence of novel and potentially deadly viruses is something we will have to confront in the future, his suggestion is surely food for thought.  the hero who gives us all hope  congratulations to national treasure captain tom moore, who is to be knighted for raising nearly £33 million for the nhs. the ever-cheerful war veteran has become a powerful symbol of hope, and if this pandemic has taught us anything, it’s the importance of hope.  it reminds me of a series of gruesome but ground-breaking experiments conducted on rats in the 1950s by american biologist, curt richter. he placed half of a group of rats in water tanks with no means of escape. for a few minutes they swam frantically before drowning.  he placed the second set of rats in tanks — but took them out just before they drowned. then he put them back in, and this made a huge difference — they were able to swim for days. richter concluded the second group had ‘hope’ — boosting their survival instinct.  we should be cautious of drawing too many conclusions from this experiment. but there is one similarity between rats and humans: we all need a bit of hope to keep afloat.  the ever-cheerful war veteran has become a powerful symbol of hope, and if this pandemic has taught us anything, it’s the importance of hope  once it was considered unhealthy to dwell on the past. now it’s a trend on social media.  thousands of people have been posting the last ‘normal’ photo on their phone, pre-lockdown — meals out with friends, a drink in a pub, a visit to the gym.  the past — even the immediate past — might be another country, but it can be a reassuring and safe place.  and another positive development is the number of old friends who have got in touch with me after years of no contact. there’s nothing wrong with a bit of nostalgia!  dr max prescribes... vitamin d testing  i’ve started ordering vitamin d tests on more patients as there is growing evidence people with a low level could be at greater risk from covid-19.  vitamin d is called the ‘sunshine vitamin’, because it is synthesised by the skin from exposure to sunlight. it is also found in certain foods such as salmon, egg yolks and mushrooms, or you can take a supplement.  you can get a test from your gp or try the first at-home finger-prick test. it costs £30 and can be ordered from nutris.viapath.co.uk."
health,"half of pregnant women at risk of pre-eclampsia are missing out on preventative aspirin, say experts.  aspirin has been used for decades to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, which leads to dangerously high blood pressure and threatens the life of both mother and baby.  every year 23,000 pregnant women in britain suffer from the condition, and it is the country’s leading cause of premature birth and stillbirth.  national guidelines recommend that women at risk of pre-eclampsia should begin to take preventative low-dose aspirin at 12 weeks of pregnancy. but writing in the drug and therapeutics bulletin, consultant obstetrician dr joanna girling said: ‘why is it that despite compelling evidence for its benefit and safety, more than 50 per cent of eligible pregnant women never start aspirin?’  half of pregnant women at risk of pre-eclampsia are missing out on preventative aspirin (file photo)  midwives are unable to prescribe a suitable dose of aspirin so have to advise women to see their gp and request a prescription.  dr girling, from west middlesex university hospital, in west london, said this low uptake could be reversed if pharmacists were allowed to prescribe the drug.  she added: ‘the cost of low-dose aspirin bought from a pharmacy is less than £5 for a six-month supply and much less costly than the unnecessary branded pregnancy related nutrients and supplements that many women choose to buy.’  ‘midwives who cannot supply aspirin have to advise the woman to see her gp to request a prescription to take to a pharmacist, using at least three further episodes of patient and health professional time.  ‘perhaps it is not surprising that so few women achieve this within the week following the booking appointment.  ‘if we are serious about increasing uptake of a nationally recommended evidence-based life-saving low-cost intervention, how about developing a national pgd [patient group direction] to allow community pharmacists to supply low-dose aspirin to women who are at risk of pre-eclampsia?’"
health,"the novel coronavirus 'hijacks' our body's cells by blocking certain genes that fight against infections, a new study suggests.  viruses, such as the flu, usually interfere with two sets of genes: one that prevents viruses from replicating and the other that sends immune cells to the infection site to kill viruses.  but researchers found sars-cov-2 behaves differently, inhibiting the genes that stop the virus from copying itself but allowing the genes that call for immune cells to behave normally.  this causes the virus to multiply and an overproduction of immune cells to flood the lungs and other organs, which leads to unmitigated inflammation.  the team, from the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york city, says treatment for patients in the early throes of the disease should be focused on restoring the pathway being blocked by coronavirus rather than focusing on inflammation.  a new study had found that coronavirus blocks interferons, genes that typically stop the virus from replicating, but allows other genes to still get the call to go to the site of infection. pictured: rna ( green) from coronavirus taking over an infected cell  this overproduction of immune cells leads to over-inflammation and causes dangerous cytokine storms, in which the body attacks its own tissues. pictured: nurse katie canina cares for a patient in the special pathogens unit icu at brigham and women's hospital in boston, massachusetts, april 27  dr benjamin tenoever, a virologist and professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine, told dailymail.com that an infected cell has 'two jobs to do'.  'one job is to tell all the cells around you to fortify...and the second job is to recruit the more professional immune cells to that site of infection,' he said.  typically, our body's cells have two groups of virus-fighting genes: interferons and chemokines.  interferons are signaling proteins released by infected cells and are named for their prowess to 'interfere' with the virus's ability to multiply itself.  chemokines are small molecules that call for immune cells to go the site of an infection so they can target and destroy the virus.  according to tenoever, the first set of genes control virus replication for about seven to 10 days so the second set has enough time to get immune cells to attack.  he refers to interferons as the 'call-to-arms' genes and to chemokines as the 'call-for-reinforcement' genes.  'the vast majority of viruses that you encounter in nature are readily neutralized and destroyed by these systems,' tenoever said.  'even the very first defense, the ""call-to-arms,"" is often enough to completely stop replication and neutralize the infection without even generating the second response.'  but, unlike the flu or severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), the coronavirus blocks one set of genes and activates the other.  for the study, published in the journal cell, the team looked at healthy human lung cells and an animal model in ferrets.  they found a very mild response from the 'call-to-arms' genes - which block the virus's replication - and a large introduction of the 'call-for-reinforcement' genes.  'a combination of these two is a bad combination,' said tenoever.  when they looked at lung cells from two covid-19 patients that died, they found the exact same response.  'basically people are contracting the disease, sars-cov-2 enters the lungs and it begins to replicate and, at that site of replication, those cells that are infected, they don't do a good job of spreading the word about their infection which allows it to essentially fester in the lungs,' tenoever said.  this means the virus is replicating because there are not a lot of interferons, but those cells still call in for reinforcements.  so different types of immune system cells - neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes - arrive to fix the job, but, by the time they arrive, there has been nothing to control that virus.  'that virus has continued to replicate and continue to spread, getting to higher and higher numbers in the lungs, but they're calling for reinforcements,' tenoever said.  now, the lungs have immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which leads to inflammation that induces more inflammation. essentially the immune system is turning against itself.  this is likely what leads to cytokine storms, which occur when the body attacks its own cells and tissues instead of just fighting off the virus.  tenoever says the way this virus behaves is 'nothing like i've seen in 20 years' of studying how cells respond to viral infections  tenoever says there are two ways to treat patients.  the first group is made up of people who are just developing symptoms and have tested positive.  they can get drugs that induce the missing 'call-to-arms' genes so the virus can behave more like a flu.  'they can try treatments that restore the pathway that is being blocked by the virus, he said.  for those that are hospitalized and intubated it's already too late for this treatment so they would be more benefited by classes of drugs called interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 inhibitors.  these could help mitigate cytokine storms and reduce inflammation throughout the body."
health,"a canadian nurse who caught the novel coronavirus months ago said she's tested positive eight times in the last 50 days.  on march 30, tracy schofield, from cambridge, ontario, began experiencing symptoms such as chills, a fever, and shortness of breath.  the following day, she took her first test for covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and the result was positive, reported ctv news.  schofield, 49, spent the traditional two weeks self-isolating, but her second test came back positive. since then, six more have returned the same result.  doctors have told the mother-of-three that they don't believe she is contagious anymore, but that they can't explain why she keeps testing positive.  tracy schofield, 49 (left and right), from cambridge, ontario, canada, tested positive for coronavirus on march 31. she spent two weeks self-isolating in her room at home, but her second test at the end of her isolation period came back positive  to be considered recovered, two negative tests need to be taken 24 hours apart. schofield's eighth overall test from cambridge memorial hospital (pictured) came back negative, but her ninth test was positive  'whenever i get the test result, it's like somebody punches me in the stomach,' schofield told ctv news.  'i just want someone to be able to tell me something. give me an answer. am i going to have it forever?'  for two weeks after her first positive test, schofield says she self-isolated in her room at her house, where she lives with her 17-year-old son, ethan.  over that period, her temperature reached 104.1f and wouldn't come down with tylenol. she says she also lost her sense of smell and taste.  'i couldn't smell vick's vaporub, i couldn't taste salt and vinegar chips,' schofield told ctv news.  now, almost two months later, the majority of her symptoms have disappeared aside from a cough and a little difficulty breathing.  however, her tests from cambridge memorial hospital have kept returning positive.  schofield says she was excited after her eighth overall test came back negative.  but patients must receive two negative results within a 24-hour period to be considered recovered. her ninth test came back positive.  and, although authorities from region of waterloo public health, have allowed her to leave her house on april 14, she says she won't consider herself recovered until she gets her two consecutive negative test results.  schofield says she has does not have any pre-existing conditions but she's concerned that she'll have long-term complications from the virus.  schofield had been cleared to go back to work as a registered practical nurse but is scared about infecting others.  she is now waiting five days until she can take her tenth overall test.  health experts say she likely just has dead virus cells still circulating in her body , ctv news reports.  it comes on the heels of news that patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus after having recovered are not contagious.  researchers from the korea centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc) looked at 285 survivors who tested positive after previous tests said they were negative.  none of the 790 people that the patients came into contact with were found to be infected with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  in the us, there are more than 1.5 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 93,000 deaths."
health,"a new investigation reveals that several antibody tests for the novel coronavirus currently on the market are unreliable.  abc news and the mayo clinic looked at nine tests that use a drop of a blood from a finger prick to see if someone has immune-fighting cells against the virus.  researchers found that four of the nine tests failed to meet the mayo clinic's medical standards for accuracy and performance.  in fact, one test gave a positive result for antibodies when researchers had only added a drop of saline solution, not a blood sample.  four of nine coronavirus antibody finger prick tests (pictured) failed to meet the mayo clinic's medical standards for accuracy and performance  one gave a false positive results after researchers had only added a drop of saline solution, not a blood sample. pictured: a registered nurse draws blood from beulah johnson during a covid-19 antibody test drive at the abyssinian baptist church in new york city, may 14  there are currently more than 200 coronavirus antibody tests available across the country, according to abc news.  the test helps identify disease-fighting antibodies in people who have been infected but may have had mild symptoms or none at all.  health officials say these tests could help scientists understand how widespread the virus is, how many people come into contact with the virus and don't get sick, and how long patients remain immune after they recover.  this is important because it could allow immune people to leave their homes and return to work and shore up the workforce as well as help healthcare workers determine if they are immune.  but, on the other hand, a false positive will make someone believe they have immunity against the virus when, in reality, they don't.  the investigation discovered that four of the nine kits that were tested gave inaccurate results for antibodies.  according to abc news, scientists also found antibody tests that use a full vial of blood provided more accurate results, but barely.  researchers gave four out of the 10 blood vial tests kits an a+, three in the 'b range"" and three a grade of f.  of the 200 kits currently on the market, only 12 have received emergency use authorization from the us food and drug administration.  dr william morice, a hematology specialist at the mayo clinic, says patients should directly ask their medical provider if they are getting a good-quality test.  'if the doctor inquires and says do you want a blood test for covid antibodies to see if you've had the disease, i would just ask the doctor if they could confidently say: ""yes, they did have the covid disease"" if the test was positive and '""no, they did not have the disease"" if the test was negative,'' he told abc news.  'if they can't answer that confidently, then i would be a little concerned about the test they were using.'  however, an encouraging new study suggests nearly everyone who contracts the novel coronavirus develops antibodies.  researchers from chongqing medical university in china found that 95 percent of 285 patients developed both types of the immune cells that fight the virus.  the findings 'bring much-needed clarity, along with renewed enthusiasm, to efforts to develop and implement wide-scale antibody testing for sars-cov-2,' wrote dr francis collins on the national institutes of health's (nih) director's blog on thursday."
health,"the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) released new guidelines on wednesday, recommending all babies born to women with confirmed or suspected coronavirus infections be tested for the disease.  although such cases are rare, infants are at greater risk of contracting serious cases of the virus in comparison with older children.  this is because their immune systems are not yet fully developed and they have smaller airways, which makes them more likely to suffer from breathing problems.  however, very few studies have been performed on babies' risks and doctors are often making medical decisions baed on anecdotal reports.  he cdc is advising that newborns be separated from mothers who have confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus. pictured: diana garcia garcia hold her baby, danaey, for the first time at mount sinai south nassau hospital in oceanside, new york, as her husband, manuel carchipulla, who tested positive for coronavirus, watches, april 28  babies should be tested within the first 24 hours and can be reunited with their mothers if the women test negative (file image)  according to the cdc, newborns can become infected either through respiratory droplets from their mother during childbirth or exposure to sick staff or visitors after delivery.  there is currently no evidence that covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, can reach a baby via the umbilical cord.  the cdc recommends that infants be tested within the first 24 hours, and be isolated from other babies that already tested negative.  health officials also recommend that the babies be isolated from their mothers until the women test negative.  if newborns do contract the virus, many experience the same symptoms as adults such as coughing, fever, diarrhea and shortness of breath.  but there have been some case reports of babies needing to placed on ventilators.  in a chinese study of 2,143 children with confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 from late december to early february, more than 10 percent of infants had severe or critical illness.  comparatively, rates were seven percent for children from ages one to five, about four percent for kids between ages six and 10, and seven percent for children 11 years old or older.  the cdc adds that newborns don't need a negative coronavirus test to be discharged from the hospital.  however, there is some fear that mothers who do have coronavirus may have premature babies that will need to be placed in nicus.  early in the pandemic, two small studies found that half of all pregnant women infected with coronavirus deliver their babies early and they may even pass the disease to their newborns.  in one study, researchers from china examined 33 newborns whose mothers had covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, while pregnant.  nearly 10 percent of the babies - three of them - were found to have the virus - including one that needed to be put on mechanical ventilation.  in the second study, looking at 32 pregnant women from china and hong kong, researchers found that 47 percent delivered their babies prematurely."
health,"most of us have been wearing face masks for several weeks to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus as the pandemic rages on.  but social media has been exploding with claims that masks reduce the intake of oxygen, forcing people to breathe in high levels of their own carbon dioxide.  people claim they feel lightheaded or dizzy, and that breathing in too much carbon dioxide could cause them to suffer from seizures, or even suffocate.  but one new york city pediatrician, dr rebekah diamond of columbia university medical center says this is just not true.  in her experiment, she shared a picture of her carbon dioxide levels after a day of wearing an n95, which showed the mask did not drive her co2 up to dangerous levels.  dailymail.com spoke to two respiratory experts who said, plainly, there is no evidence that prolonged face mask use will reduce oxygen levels in the blood - or kill you.  dr rebekah diamond of columbia university medical center in new york city took a photo of her blood co2 levels after wearing an n95 all day  normal pco2 levels are between 35 millimeters of mercury (mmhg) and 45 mmhg and diamond's levels were 36.4 mmhg  the pediatrician said she wants to combat the misinformation that is spreading about how prolonged face mask use is dangerous  'apparently worrying about hypercapnea (too much carbon dioxide) from wearing a breathable cloth mask is a thing,' diamond wrote on twitter.  normal pco2 levels are between 35 millimeters of mercury (mmhg) and 45 mmhg.  diamond took a blood test that showed the levels of gases in her body. her co2 levels were 36.4 mmhg.  'so here's my normal venous co2 after wearing an n95 all day to remind you it's really ok. don't let fake science enable unsafe decisions [please],' she wrote.  she then posted a photo of herself outside the hospital where she works wearing both an n95 mask and a face shield.  'plenty of reasons to hate masks. just don’t let false claims be one of them, so thank you for seeing through that!' diamond tweeted.  'this is what i wear and it definitely makes me lightheaded, leaves marks on my face, irritated skin, even causes headaches. we do what we have to.'  several posts have been circulating around social media claiming that wearing a face mask can cause such a build-up of carbon dioxide that leads to people passing out - or worse.  one facebook post from may 8 claims 'oxygen in the blood reduces' and 'oxygen to the brain reduces' from wearing masks for too long.  another post alleged 'prolonged use of a face mask' can led to hypoxia, which is when there are low oxygen levels in the tissues that can result in death  several posts online claim that prolonged face mask use can reduce oxygen in the blood or lead to hypoxia, which is when there are low oxygen levels in the tissues  dr steve lubinsky, the medical director of respiratory care at new york university langone health, told dailymail.com there is no danger in face mask use.  '[masks are] not comfortable and there is data that shows they can cause headaches, they're irritating and it does interfere with daily life,' he said.  'i think people kind of sense that. these are common symptoms we all get and i think people may have focused on that.'  dr raed dweik, chair of the cleveland clinic's respiratory institute, says he also thinks it's a social concern.  'people want to see the face, and that's understandable of normal conditions,' he told dailymail.com.  'but at a time when health is adrift, it's important to [wear masks] for us and for each other.'  there are rare cases in which carbon dioxide, a natural by-product of respiration, can be deadly.  inhaling high levels of the gas can lead to hypercapnia, also known as carbon dioxide toxicity, and cause headaches, double vision, lack of concentration or suffocation - but it has to be a very high concentration of co2.  'we've seen, in new york, there's a significant risk of illness and death in patients who get covid-19, we've seen people get sick, grievously ill and die,' lubinksy said.  'we've never seen anyone with an illness due to face mask use.'  both physicians say wearing face masks should be coupled with social distancing and good hand hygiene such as washing your hands and trying not to touch your face.  'short of having universal testing, the best next thing is to cover each other's faces, nose and mouth and emphasize that this doesn't replace other important things like social distancing and hand washing,' said dweik.  'when you wear it, you are protecting others and when others wear it, they are protecting you. it's almost like a selfish act not to wear a mask in public.'"
health,"for those who already love the great outdoors, it will come as no surprise.  daily contact with nature is good for health and happiness, a major survey has found.  but rather than outdoor types, it is those who usually feel little connection to nature who stand to benefit the most, the researchers discovered.  daily contact with nature is good for health and happiness, a major survey has found. a stock image is used above [file photo]  the university of derby team carried out a five-year review of the wildlife trusts' 30 days wild challenge, in which people commit to exploring nature every day.  they looked at 1,000 survey responses and found those taking part typically reported a 30 per cent boost to health.  respondents also said they felt happier and more connected to nature.  professor miles richardson at the university of derby, said the evaluation 'shows the positive power of simple engagement with nature'.  but rather than outdoor types, it is those who usually feel little connection to nature who stand to benefit the most, the researchers discovered. a stock image is used above [file photo]  'we were thrilled to see that the significant increases in people's health and happiness were still felt even two months after the 30 days wild challenge was over,' he said.  'the wildlife trusts have shown the importance of doing simple things to enjoy everyday nature and that it can bring considerable benefits.  'what really stood out was how the people who didn't feel a connection with nature at the outset were the ones who benefited most from taking part in 30 days wild.'  dom higgins, head of health and education at the wildlife trusts, said: 'connecting with nature every day, in an easy way, is a must have for our own wellbeing.  'that's why the wildlife trusts are campaigning for better, wilder places near to where we all live and work so that everyone, everywhere, can enjoy nature on the doorstep.'  he added: 'our lives have been changed by coronavirus and this is giving people a reason to reflect on our relationship with nature, the way we live our lives and how we spend our free time.  'precious moments outside on a daily walk help us to relax and feel happier.  'even watching wildlife from a window, or on a webcam, connects us to that sense of being a part of nature, not apart from it.'"
health,"many people across the us who had symptoms akin to those of a common cold - cough, fever, runny nose - think they've had coronavirus.  but most probably haven't, research from the icahn school of medicine at mt sinai in new york city suggests.  scientists there recruited more than 1,300 people from city who'd either tested positive for coronavirus or suspected they'd had it, but hadn't been tested.  of 719 people who thought they'd had it, 37 percent tested negative for both the virus and antibodies they might have produced had they previously been infected.  'that does imply that likely many of the people who suspect that they had this probably didn't have it,' study co-author dr ania wajnberg.  and assuming that they have had coronavirus and thus developed antibodies that might protect them against reinfection - an immunity that is still uncertain - might put people at greater risk of foregoing social distancing and exposing themselves to the virus in the first place.  many americans believe they've had coronavirus - but antibody testing of new york city residents who suspected they'd been infected revealed only 37% had antibodies that might protect them against reinfection (file)  as of wednesday, more than 1.57 million americans have tested positive for coronavirus.  that means that that less than 0.5 percent of the us population has had coronavirus  yet, a third of americans think they may have had it, suggests a recent business insider poll.  estimates from most epidemiological models and antibody testing initiatives suggest the real number of infections falls somewhere in the gaping space between those two figures.  so far in new york city - the pandemic's epicenter - about one in five people tested have antibodies against coronavirus, indicating they've been infected already.  university of southern california's latest antibody testing study suggests that somewhere between 2.5 and seven percent of angelinos have caught coronavirus.  in boston, 10 percent of residents tested for antibodies had them, as did 4.4 percent of people in france.  us officials have even considered using antibody testing as the basis of 'immunity passports,' and the uk and germany have made moves to implement the documentation showing that people have tested positive for antibodies against the virus and may be immune to reinfection to help reopen societies.  at the moment, even if someone does test positive for antibodies, we don't yet know what level of protection that provides, or how long it might last.  and people resuming normal life on the basis of the assumption that they've had coronavirus and have antibodies that will protect them (also an unproven assumption) is even more dangerous.  for their antibody testing study, the mt sinai team recruited 1,343 people.  of those, 624 had been diagnosed with coronavirus, confirmed by gold standard pcr swab tests.  the other 719 suspected they had coronavirus because they'd had symptoms, had been living with someone with a confirmed diagnosis, were told by a doctor they had the virus or were healthcare workers.  most did not have antibodies to suggest they'd been infected.  only 36 percent developed igg antibodies - the kind that confers more lasting immunity - to sars-cov-1, which causes covid-19, and 37 percent were negative for both antibodies and current infection.  'this finding suggests that a majority of participants suspected of having covid-19 actually were not infected with sars-cov-2,' the study authors wrote.  'however, it may also include a false negative rate of our assay (which has a 92 percent sensitivity) or insufficient time for participants to mount an igg antibody response.'  encouragingly, nearly everyone who was diagnosed with a coronavirus did in fact develop antibodies, suggesting most people will gain some degree of protection after recovery."
health,"women who suffer multiple miscarriages are at greater risk of developing diabetes, according to a study.  those who had experienced one pregnancy loss were found to be 18 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared with women who had never lost a baby.  two miscarriages was linked to a 38 per cent higher risk, and three miscarriages increased the chances by 71 per cent.  the scientists were then able to calculate the odds of developing type 2 diabetes with different numbers of miscarriages. their findings were published in the journal diabetologia [file photo]  the researchers proposed that women with three or more lost pregnancies could have their blood sugar profile more frequently monitored so that lifestyle advice can be offered to lower their risk and interventions can be applied early if diabetes develops.  the leader of the study, dr pia egerup, of copenhagen university hospital in denmark, said: ‘we cannot rule out that the psychological distress related to pregnancy loss can initiate lifestyle changes that increase body mass index and thereby the risk of type 2 diabetes.  ‘our analysis in which we adjusted for obesity still showed a significant association between pregnancy loss and type 2 diabetes, with more losses leading to a higher risk.  those who had experienced one pregnancy loss were found to be 18 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared with women who had never lost a baby [file photo]  ‘this indicated that the higher risk for type 2 diabetes in women with pregnancy losses cannot be explained by obesity alone.’  the researchers looked at more than 24,700 danish women born between 1957 and 1997 who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between 1977 and 2017. they also analysed 247,740 women without diabetes as controls.  each woman with diabetes was matched by birth year and educational level with ten control women without diabetes.  the scientists were then able to calculate the odds of developing type 2 diabetes with different numbers of miscarriages. their findings were published in the journal diabetologia.  dr egerup said: ‘perhaps the same genetic background could predispose to an increased risk for both.  ‘also, pregnancy loss could initiate an immunological cascade that also could lead to later type 2 diabetes.  ‘additionally, it is possible prediabetic metabolic conditions – present before the diagnosis of diabetes – could influence the association.’"
health,"a team of canadian scientists is testing whether or not marijuana compounds can block coronavirus infection.  researchers at the university of lethbridge in alberta looked at 400 cannabis strains and focused on about a dozen that showed promise in preventing the virus from 'hijacking' our cells.  they say extracts of cannabidiol (cbd), the main non-psychoactive component of pot - helped lower the number of cell receptors available for coronavirus to attach to by more than 70 percent.  however, the team says people should not rush out and by cannabis products and that clinical trials are needed to confirm the results.  researchers from the university of lethbridge in alberta, canada looked at 400 cannabis strains and focused on about a dozen (file image)  they studied how extracts high in cbd, the main nonpsychoactive ingredient in, interacted with receptors coronavirus uses to attack cells. pictured: a nurse suctions the lungs of a covid-19 patient at st. joseph's hospital in yonkers, ny, april 20  for the study, published in the pre-peer reviewed journal preprints, the scientists partnered with pathway rx, a cannabis therapy research company, and swysh inc, a cannabinoid-based research company.  the team created artificial 3d human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues with a sample of high cbd extracts from cannabis sativa plants.  the extracts were low in thc, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.  next, researchers tested the effect the extracts had on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), the receptors required for the virus to enter human cells.  results showed that the extracts helped reduce the number of receptors that are the 'gateway' for the coronavirus to 'hijack' host cells.  the team, led by dr igor kovalchuk (pictured) found the extracts lowered the number of receptors the virus uses to infects cells and multiply by more than 70%  'a number of them have reduced the number of [virus] receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower,' lead researchers dr igor kovalchuk, ceo of pathway rx, told the calgary herald.  'if they can reduce the number of receptors, there's much less chance of getting infected.'  they also looked at other receptors such as tmprss2, which allows the virus to invade cells more easily and multiply quickly.  'imagine a cell being a large building,' kovalchuk told ctv news.  'cannabinoids decrease the number of doors in the building by, say, 70 percent, so it means the level of entry will be restricted. so, therefore, you have more chance to fight it.'  however, the team says this does not mean that people should go out and buy marijuana products as prophylactics.  cannabis and cbd products that are currently on the market are not designed to treat or prevent infection from covid-19. therefore, clinical trials are needed.  'given the current dire and rapidly developing epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue needs to be considered,' kovalchuk said in an april press release.  'our research team is actively pursuing partnerships to conduct clinical trials.'  if trials proves to be successful, he says the cbd strains may be used as mouth wash, gargle, inhalants or gel caps,  'it would be cheaper for people and have a lot less side-effects,' kovalchuk told the herald."
health,"new york city vaccination rates among children have dramatically fallen during the coronavirus pandemic.  mayor bill de blasio told reporters during a press conference on wednesday that the number of administered vaccines is down 63 percent compared to this time last year.  immunizations overall have fallen by about two-thirds from this time in 2019. among children two years old and younger, they have decreased by 42 percent and in children older than age two, vaccinations are down 91 percent.  youngsters haven't been getting their typical shots against diseases such as measles and chickenpox because parents have feared their children might get coronavirus during a doctor's visit.  in addition, fewer physicians' offices are open to even administer the inoculations.  scroll down for video  vaccinations among children younger than age two have decreased by 42% and have fallen by 91% among children older than two years older, mayor de blasio revealed  the number of doses has decreased by 63% from almost 400,000 at this time last year to 150,000 over a six-week period this year (file image)  over a six-week period during this time last year, doctors administered almost 400,000 vaccine doses.  by comparison, over the six-week period this year, fewer than 150,000 doses have been administered.  dr hanan tanuos, director of primary care and an associate professor of pediatrics at rutgers new jersey medical school told dailymail.com the reason for this drop is likely two-fold.  'i think part of it of course is the parents are afraid to bring their children out and i think the other part is that the availability of doctors is limited,' she said.  the mayor stressed a child contacting an illness that could have prevented in addition to coronavirus could create a very dangerous situation.  'the vaccines that, for example, prevent respiratory illnesses like pneumonia are important any time,' de blasio said.  'a child who gets one of these diseases is likely to need to be hospitalized and they're likely to be more susceptible to contracting covid.'  de blasio said this also increases the risk of children falling ill with 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.'  this is the rare inflammatory condition that has been associated with covid-19 and has affected at least 145 children in the city.  he added that vaccines are not just important for children with normal immune system but also for those who are immunocompromised and therefore, more vulnerable to catching childhood diseases and coronavirus.  therefore, increasing immunization rates will not only protect kids but communities as a whole.  officials from the city's health department stressed that there is no link between jabs and coronavirus.  'we're learning more and more about how covid-19 manifests in children,' dr oxiris barbot, commissioner of the new york city department of health and mental hygiene, said during the press conference.  'that being said, there is no indication that there is any correlation with vaccination status in children.'  to help drive vaccinations up, the city will offer free vaccinations - not for covid-19 - at more than 1,000 new york city facilities and at all health and human community health clinics.  'the bottom line to all parents, all family members out there: get your child vaccinated,' de blasio said.  it comes on the heels of a recent centers for disease control and prevention report that found similar alarming declines.  vaccination rates for children aged five months and younger in michigan in may fell to 49.7 percent.  by comparison, about two-thirds of children in that age bracket were given jabs in may 2016.  public health officials have warned for years that vaccines not only protect individuals but the community as a whole in what is known as 'herd immunity'.  this occurs when the vast majority of a community - between 80 and 95 percent - becomes immune so that, if a disease is introduced, it is unable to spread.  therefore, those who are unable to be vaccinated, including the ill, very young and very old, are protected.  now, health authorities are worried that falling rates might destroy the herd immunity that had bee built up against certain diseases.  'if this goes on for long enough and enough children don't get vaccinated, then we might see small outbreaks of some of these diseases, some more easily than others,' dr joseph schwab, an associate professor of pediatrics at rutgers new jersey medical school, told dailymail.com.  he said one disease he is concerned about is pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough.  'pertussis is one i'm concerned about because that's something that passes on from older people to the kids,' he said.  '[parents] shouldn't let fear, because of the pandemic, prevent them from getting the care.'"
health,"a new study suggests that the novel coronavirus didn't arrive in the us and sicken people before 2020.  researchers from stanford university looked at 1,700 throat swabs and did not find any of them to contain traces of the strain sars-cov-2.  the team says this doesn't mean the virus wasn't circulating in the us in 2019. but it does mean that potential patients weren't seeking care at stanford.  researchers looked at 1,700 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between october 31, 2019 and december 31, 2019 at stanford health care. pictured: a worker performs drive-up covid-19 testing administered from a car in los angeles, california, may 13  none of the samples contained traces of the novel coronavirus. pictured: a healthcare worker takes a nasal swab sample from a new york city resident to test for covid-19, may 13  for the study, published in the pre-print server medrxiv.org, the team looked at 1,700 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between october 31, 2019 and december 31, 2019 at stanford health care.  all of them were negative for routine respiratory virus testing and none had been tested for covid-19.  however, no traces of the virus were detected.  'no sars-cov-2 positive pools were 19 identified, consistent with limited transmission in this population at this time,' the authors wrote.  several reports have emerged implying that the virus arrived in the us as early as last year.  the first documented case of covid-19 is a man in his 50s in snohomish county, washington on january 20, 2020.  but two other residents of snohomish county tested positive for antibodies after falling ill with similar symptoms in december, reported the seattle times.  this is not the first time that health officials have had to grapple with the fact the virus may have been circulating earlier in the us.  until recently, it was believed that a resident of the lifecare center of kirkland, who died on february 26, was the first covid-19 death in america.  however, in april, it was revealed through autopsies that the first death actually occurred in santa clara, california on february 6.  similar analyses have also been performed outside of the us.  an unconfirmed report in the south china morning post indicated a covid-19 case in china's hubei province on november 17, 2019.  that's weeks earlier than when chinese officials in the city of wuhan, where the virus originated, alerted the world health organization to the outbreak.  additionally, a french study detected sars-cov-2 in a respiratory sample collected on december 27, 2019. that's a month earlier than official cases were reported in the country.  there has been an active interest in identifying the 'patient zero' of various regions to better understand how the virus spread and prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future."
health,"patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus after having recovered are not contagious, a new study finds.  researchers from the korea centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc) looked at 285 survivors who tested positive after previous tests said they were negative.  none of the 790 people that the patients came into contact with were found to be infected with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  the team says the findings are a sign that some areas might be safer to reopen than previously believed.  of the 790 people that about 285 're-infected' coronavirus patients came into contact with, none were found to be infected with the virus. pictured: people wearing face masks wait to take a test for the new coronavirus at a testing facility in incheon, south korea, may 13  researchers believe the patients were not re-infected but rather they they were shedding dead virus particles. pictured: staff at a covid-19 testing center pass a mouth swab self test kit to a driver at a drive-up testing center in los angeles, california, may 14  researchers also found that the virus samples collected from the patients who tested positive a second time couldn't be grown in lab cultures.  this suggests the patients were not re-infected but rather that they were shedding dead virus particles.  the results are welcome after health authorities in south korea raised alarms last month upon dozens of recovered patients testing positive for the virus again.  as of tuesday, more than 400 people have reconfirmed cases of the virus, according to the kcdc.  'we're putting more weight on the theory that dead virus fragments remain in a recovered patient's body, since we haven't seen evidence of infectivity,' dr ki moran, a professor at the national cancer center graduate school, told the wall street journal.  because of the study's results, south korean health officials will no longer consider people infectious after they recover from covid-19.  this means that after recovering or completing an isolation period, resident will not have to test negative for the virus before returning to school or work  'under the new protocols, no additional tests are required for cases that have been discharged from isolation,' the kcdc wrote in a report, according to bloomberg.  cases in which someone has tested positive again will not be referred to as 'pcr re-detected after discharge from isolation.'  the report also found that almost all of the 285 patients had antibodies, which provides more evidence that antibodies provide protection against the virus.  however, it remains unclear how many antibodies one needs to prevent being re-infected and how long they remain in the body.  the findings are not just important to south korea but across the world, including local and state governments in the us as they grapple with how to safely reopen.  one idea has been to issue 'immunity passports' or 'risk-free certificates' to people who were infected but later tested negative.  but the world health organization (who) advised against this and said the accuracy of such documents could not be guaranteed.  'some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, could serve as the basis for an 'immunity passport' or 'risk-free certificate' that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection,' the who said in a statement.  'there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.'"
health,"your smartphone may soon be able to detect if you have coronavirus by coughing or sneezing onto a sensor.  a team at the university of utah in salt lake city has developed a portable, reusable device the size of a quarter that plugs into a phone's charging port.  if the virus is in the sample, dna strands in the sensor bind to the virus's proteins, which would trigger an electrical signal of a positive result.  what's more, the sensor can detect covid-19, the highly-infectious disease caused by the virus, in just 60 seconds.  researchers have developed a coronavirus sensor (pictured) that can plug into the charging port of a smartphone and uses single-strand dna to look for a combination of proteins (file image)  the strands in the sensor bind to the proteins in the virus and signal a positive result either by changing color or electronically generating a signal in just 60 seconds (file image)  researchers from harvard university have estimated that between 500,000 and 700,000 tests need to be performed every day to safely reopen the us.  but just 11,834,508 coronavirus tests have been performed so far, according to the covid tracking project.  usually, people are tested by having a six-inch swab inserted deep into the nose or at the back of throat for about 15 seconds.  the sample is then sent to a laboratory, and results can take as long as a week to be confirmed.  the new sensor is less invasive, less expensive and shortens the timeline from weeks to minutes.  'other tests out there detect parts of the virus like the dna or the rna,' dr massood tabib-azar, a professor of engineering at the university of utah, told dailymail.com.  'our device detects the virus a whole so, because of that, it is faster.'  tabib-azar first began developing the technology almost one year ago to help detect the zika virus.  the sensor uses a synthetic dna piece called 'aptamer' that binds a protein called nucleolin found on the surface of cells.  a person would plug the device into the phone and place a drop of saliva on it and the dna would look for a specific combination of proteins and reduces the rate of false positive and false negatives.  'the single-strand dna is the molecular recognition so it only latches onto coronavirus and gives a kind of selectivity,' tabib-azar said.  if the virus is in the sample, the dna will bind to the proteins in the virus and signal a positive result either by changing color or electronically generating a signal.  the sensor could also be used to test if coronavirus is on a surface such as a kitchen table or a desk by swabbing it and placing it on the device.  it is also reusable because a small electric current would destroy the previous sample and wipe it clean.  tabib-azar says a person could push a button on their phone and send the information to health agencies so officials can track virus hotspots.  'this can generate a real-time map of how the coronavirus is changing in a city or a country,' he said.  to help develop the sensor quickly, the team has received a $200,000 rapid response grant from the national science foundation.  because the technology already exists, tabib-azar estimates a covid-19 sensor prototype could be ready for clinical trials in as little as three weeks.  'using a sensor is like a blind man searching for things surround them; it finds things we cannot see,' he said.  'we hope to provide it to anyone who needs it or wants it but, in the meantime, we still need to continue to wear masks to protect others and they wear masks to protect us.'"
health,"since the coronavirus pandemic began, we've all been told to socially distance by standing or sitting six feet (or two meters) apart from strangers.  but a new study suggests that distance might not be far enough to prevent virus transmission, even in light winds.  researchers found that even in winds of two miles per hour (mph) - the speed needed for smoke to drift through the air - saliva can travel 18 feet in just five seconds.  the team, from the university of nicosia in cyprus, says the findings show that the safety distance guidelines may not be doing all that much to prevent us from catching covid-19, the deadly disease caused by the virus.  a new model from the university of nicosia in cyprus has found that infected saliva droplets can travel 18 feet in just five seconds in light 2mph winds (pictured)  health officials have recommended that people social distance by staying six feet apart to prevent coronavirus from spreading. pictured: people relax in circles marked on the grass for proper social distancing at brooklyn's domino park, may 18  for the study, published in the journal physics of fluid, the team decided to examine how saliva travels through the air.  they created a computer simulation that looks at how every saliva droplet, large and small, moves through the air after a person coughs.  about 3,000 droplets are expelled from single cough, with many of them dispersing in different directions.  from a sneeze, as many as 40,000 droplets might be expelled  many factors can affect how droplets travel through the air including the size and number of droplets, humidity and how droplets evaporate - all of which were considered in the model.  'each cell holds information about variables like pressure, fluid velocity, temperature, droplet mass, droplet position, etc,' dr talib dbouk, a senior researcher at the defense and security research institute at the university of nicosia.  'the purpose of the mathematical modeling and simulation is to take into account all the real coupling or interaction mechanisms that may take place between the main bulk fluid flow and the saliva droplets, and between the saliva droplets themselves.'  the model ran different equations regarding how far, and how quickly, 1,008 saliva droplets can travel.  results showed that even in the slightest breeze of 2mph (or 4kph), saliva can travel 18 feet - the length of three refrigerators laying down side by side - in five seconds.  'the droplet cloud will affect both adults and children of different heights,' said dr dimitris draikakis, a professor in the medical school and the school of sciences and engineering at the university of nicosia.  'shorter adults and children could be at higher risk if they are located within the trajectory of the traveling saliva droplets.'  for future research, the team plans to study how other things effect saliva traveling through the air such as ground surface temperature and air conditioning.  'this work is vital, because it concerns health and safety distance guidelines, advances the understanding of spreading and transmission of airborne diseases, and helps form precautionary measures based on scientific results,' drikakis said.  the findings come on the heels of the uk's former conservative party leader iain duncan smith calling today for the prime minister to consider lowering the two-meter rule to 'get the economy moving'.  the mp suggested the uk is the 'only country in europe' using two-meter distance, with germany, poland and the netherlands practicing separation of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet.  however, this is factually untrue as several european countries are also practicing two-meter social distancing, including switzerland, spain and italy.  in the us, there are currently more than 1.5 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 90,000 deaths."
